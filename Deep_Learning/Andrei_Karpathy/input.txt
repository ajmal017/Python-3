Gentlemen,

I have been speaking with Gabor for quite some time and even before I joined Interactive brokers this past year. During our last meeting, he suggested that that there is interest from your side in doing more with us, however each of you has a few issues or questions on our offering but there has not really been a relationship manager to coordinate or follow up.

I wanted to take the opportunity to introduce myself and suggest that I would be willing to help you get the clarity you need so that you are able to take advantage of what we have to offer.  Some of the topics Gabor mentioned ( some on your behalf ) involve futures, margin calculations, back office needs, as well as setting up sub accounts.

My goal is to transparently address your issues and direct you to answers to ultimately make things easier for you and help you grow your business. With this â€“ I would ask if each of you could forward me you full contact details, as well as an overview of where you think we can help. When I have this I may find that some of you have similar problems or needs ( perhaps on the back office side ) and I can coordinate and follow up with you.

I would appreciate any feedback and will try my best to help.

Best regards and I look forward to working with you.
