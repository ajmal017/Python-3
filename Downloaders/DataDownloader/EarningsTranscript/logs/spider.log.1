Now I\'d like to turn it over the David Henshall, our Chief Operating Officer and CFO. David? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. We continue to show good results and execution from the operational initiatives driving leverage to the strength in product portfolio that\'s fueling growth and increased win rates. We\'re focused on our core strategy of securely delivering apps and data both on-premises and in the cloud, setting the company up for success in 2017 and over the long term. As a note, throughout the call today, we\'ll only be discussing results from continuing operations, excluding the one-month impact from the former GoTo products. As you can see from the release, Q1 results were as forecasted. Revenue was up 1%, adjusted op margin was 28% and adjusted EPS was $0.97 a share. However, the mix of sales in the period saw a large increase in subscription-based items like CSP, annual term license and Citrix Cloud sales. This contributed to billings growth of over 5% year-on-year as well as total deferred revenue, which was up 11%. I\'ll talk more about these trends here in a couple minutes. In Q1, we closed 47 $1 million-plus transactions, with strength in technology, fin services and health care. There\'s good balance across the portfolio with approximately two-thirds of these deals coming from the Workspace Services area including the full suite and the balance from networking and cloud. So next, let\'s look at the Q1 results within our primary product areas. Workspace Services, which includes virtualization and mobility, was flat year-on-year at $400 million. As we\'ve discussed before, there are several specific initiatives we\'re driving to accelerate growth in this area including faster innovation, integration of our unique assets, greater competitive positioning and the reinvigoration of our channel partnerships, especially with Microsoft. These efforts have steadily increased our win rate and competitive opportunities. There are, however, a few dynamics that are worth noting from Q1. First, the sales mix in this business is where we\'re seeing the most pronounced shift to subscription-based offerings. In total, the contribution from contracts of this type was over 20% of product license sales, up from just 11% a year ago. Next, on a recognized basis, license revenue growth in the Americas was up over 5% in the quarter, continuing the above-market growth seen in this region over many, many quarters, and we\'re also seeing good traction from our APJ restructuring, where Workspace Services license was up 9% in Q1. Third, we had strong growth in monthly CSP subscriptions, where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Total recognized revenue in this area grew 36% and now has an annualized run rate of $90 million. And finally, we\'ve had a really good response from the newly launched Customer Success Services, the redefined software maintenance program that we announced at the beginning of last quarter – really helping to drive growth in deferred revenue as well. Turning to the Networking business, total revenue decreased 1% year-on-year in the quarter to $193 million with license revenue down 9% year-on-year. This result is in line with our forecast as we expected a decline in the Cloud Infrastructure segment due to the difficult comps from a year ago. I will remind everybody that the NetScaler business is essentially made up of two main segments: cloud infrastructure and e-com, also known as our SSP business; and enterprise ADC, which includes solutions sales made alongside the Xen family products. Within the quarter, SSP license sales were down about 20% year-on-year but up nearly 100% sequentially from Q4. We continue to expect growth rates to increase in the second half of the year due to easier comps as well as our focus on expanding the base of customers. In the enterprise ADC segment, license increased nicely in Q1 due to the capacity in management investments we made in the second half of last year. All in, we sold to about 1,900 networking customers in the period with 30% of them being new, which reflects our strong competitive position as well as providing expansion opportunities in the future. And finally, our total SaaS revenue was up 24% to $39 million in the quarter. The largest component of this is ShareFile, our secure data platform, with the new Citrix Cloud services now addressing Workspace-as-a-Service and the networking needs of our customers. As I mentioned earlier a couple times, we are seeing an increased shift in the way that our products are being delivered, evolving towards a more subscription-based model where unit growth, sales and cash flow are going to exceed revenue in the short term. When we account for all of the ratable product subscription items, including revenue that\'s coming from CSPs, our cloud-based services and annual term license, the aggregate ARR was over $275 million in Q1, which is up 22% from last year. We do expect this trend to continue throughout the year as more of our portfolio is available as a service in Citrix Cloud. Given the increased pace of this transformation, right now we\'re planning to provide more insight into the longer-term economic model as well as our plan for the revenue model at our Analyst Meeting at the end of May. So turning to operations, we\'ve driven a lot of efficiencies in the company over the past couple of years. The actions across the business were designed to generate permanent expense reductions while reallocating investment to those areas that will drive profitable growth in the future. In Q1, adjusted op margin 28%. It was down a couple points from last year but in line with our plan for 2017. The difference from last year represents those capacity investments in sales and services to drive enterprise networking, tech support investments to support this upgrade to Customer Success Services, and in professional services to assist customers with cloud and security projects. We\'re still comfortable with our full-year target of 32% to 33% even as more revenue is being recognized ratably. Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue increased to $1.66 billion, up 11% from last year due to the strength of Customer Success Services and these subscription-based sales that I\'ve been talking about. Exiting Q1, we had nearly $2.4 billion in cash and investments, aided by cash flow from ops of $292 million from continuing operations in Q1. In total, cash was down from the end of Q4 as we restarted and accelerated our share repurchase program. In the quarter, we purchased over 7 million shares for a total of $550 million, which leaves about $400 million in our additional authorization. So our growth strategy in operational programs have been working. We\'re pleased with the results and confident in our plans as we consider this coming year. Before I discuss our guidance moving forward, I\'d like to provide a little color around our plan. Overall, our view of the Workspace Services opportunity continues to strengthen, and we expect cloud adoption and the mix of subscription-based sales to begin to accelerate as we move through the year. In networking, we remain our conservative view due to the cyclical nature of the NetScaler SSP segment, which we continue to expect is going to return to growth in the second half of the year. And on margins, we\'ll manage OpEx to drive leverage in the areas that we\'ve outlined previously. So for the full year 2017, we are leaving our guidance unchanged and continue to expect revenue between $2.81 billion and $2.84 billion, which is an increase of 3% to 4% over last year, and adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.65 per share. For Q2, with an increasing mix of ratable sales, we expect revenue between $685 million and $695 million, and adjusted EPS of $0.97 to $1. We\'re proud of the continued improvement in results, our new product innovations and the early returns from Citrix Cloud. We\'re also continuing to make those go-to-market capacity investments that should drive additional growth as we move through this year. So now I\'d like to turn it over to Kirill to give further color on the quarter and our focus areas looking forward. Kirill? Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Thank you, David. Hello and welcome, everyone. This was indeed a significant quarter in our transformation, so let me add a few qualitative highlights. Our global field teams exceeded their bookings plans in all geos. The new leadership in both APJ and EMEA demonstrating much improved execution, growing bookings in the double digits. And as in previous quarters, the Americas team continued growth momentum in the first quarter. For the first time in more than four years, our Workspace Services product bookings grew double digits. One could say that we have turned the tide here. We\'ve added over 1 million new users, which is about 50% faster user base growth year-on-year, with mix strongly shifting towards subscription as David mentioned. 139 customers chose Citrix Cloud in Q1 to run their workspaces, with most of them being existing Citrix customers transitioning to the cloud, with several of them were seven-figure cloud deals. Both CSP and ShareFile did very well, adding to the overall subscription ARR which exceeded $275 million, as David mentioned. In addition, our innovation and increased competitive positioning are paying off with over 1,000 competitive wins in Workspace Services and Networking in Q1, with overall win rates continues to accelerate. Our momentum is building, making it clear that our strategy and execution are focused in the right direction. Now let me add a few extra comments on our solution areas. We\'ve continued with an accelerated quarterly update cadence for our core XenApp, XenDesktop products, delivering the 7.13 release in Q1. We\'ve also fully integrated recently acquired Unidesk technology into our solutions set, adding to the overall momentum. Among many Q1 wins against the competition, two major global financial institutions chose Citrix for application delivery driven primarily by our unique capability with Skype for Business. As we moved into 2017, we set the priority for our sellers and partners to lead with Citrix Workspace Suite, and this quarter we\'re already seeing results. Among many large wins, Saab chose CWS to enable the company\'s digital transformation and desktop delivery. Our unified product organization is now much more focused on integrated innovation, making CWS even more appealing in the future. Moving on to networking products. We\'ve continued to innovate rapidly here, stressing our unique pure software-defined and application-first approaches. In Q1, we introduced NetScaler SD-WAN as a service in Azure with Zero Touch Deployment, and we released NetScaler Gateway through Microsoft EMS, and also NetScaler SD-WAN 9.2 with improved scalability and throughput. This rapid innovation makes us very enthusiastic about our future prospects with NetScaler, particularly in SD-WAN where our years of experience in application-aware networking and scalability make a huge difference and paying off already. For example, a major European home furnishings company chose SD-WAN for branch reliability, driven by the performance and app-aware capabilities of our solution. While David mentioned NetScaler SSP results remained muted in Q1 due to the cyclical nature of this business, we saw growth for NetScaler ADC in the enterprise. For example, a major Asian electronics company and a major North American insurance company both chose NetScaler ADC for the reliability and security that it offers. We also saw many switching opportunities with NetScaler, driven by a combination of scalability, performance and security that only Citrix can offer. For example, the Nemours Foundation chose NetScaler to replace a competitor to support their needs for hosting the number one most visited children\'s health website in the world, KidsHealth.org. Very exciting undertaking by the Citrix team. On to the secure data delivery. ShareFile had a very strong quarter in the enterprise, demonstrating the proven value that ShareFile brings to companies of all sizes. We\'re seeing particularly strong traction with ShareFile in EMEA, where data residency is of particular concern. For example, a major global auditing firm chose ShareFile for better (15:49) sharing and mobility for their data delivery in Europe. We continue to drive rapid innovation with ShareFile, a true born-in-the-cloud service. Speaking of the cloud, as we mentioned, our cloud transformation is clearly picking up momentum. We\'re seeing strong demand from both existing and new customers. As an example, Health Choice Network, a leading U.S. health information technology firm, chose Citrix Cloud to deliver on the company\'s new cloud-first strategy. HCN has been a Citrix customer for more than two decades, and now they felt that Citrix Cloud was the perfect fit for their digital transformation. Another large cloud win was Capita Customer Management, a major European customer management outsourcing firm. Capita cited Citrix Cloud as the only solution that offered the agility, features and scale to deliver on their cloud-first strategy. As we said (16:47) the past quarters, cybersecurity concern continued to be a growth catalyst for Citrix. We have been doing more to both drive the product innovation in the security space and appropriately adjust our positioning. Customers are increasingly viewing Citrix solution as a crucial piece of their security efforts. For example, Hitachi, a long-time Citrix customer, now chose XenDesktop to deploy 80,000 Hitachi-made notebook thin clients for their current time and location-free work force initiative, driven by a need for increased security and also data protection. A few notes on our partnerships, starting with Microsoft. I\'m extremely excited to report that we released the cloud-native, multitenant app and desktop delivery services in Azure Marketplace the last week of March. In fact, we\'re trending in Azure Marketplace this week and already have 175 customers who have signed up to use these services. Beyond that, we saw continued joint wins with Microsoft. In one such win against a major competitor, the Queensland Investment Corporation chose Citrix Cloud and Microsoft Azure in a large deal driven by strengths and trust of this partnership for their Windows 10 migration. We also launched our partnership with Samsung, enabling a true Windows desktop experience on the new Galaxy S8. Fully executed in our strategy to secure delivery apps and data on any device. And, of course, we continue to see good execution and traction from our broad distributors and from our partner channel, and we\'ll continue to make it a big priority for Citrix as we continue in 2017. Next month, we head to Orlando for Citrix Synergy 2017, our major user conference of the year. We will be making several major product and partnership announcements. We will also be hosting our Financial Analyst Meeting at the event, and I hope to see many of you in person there. Thank you. And as always, we look forward to your questions. David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Operator, let\'s now open up for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I have two quick questions. First of all, the speed of the transition towards more subscriptions seems to be picking up here. Can you think about how you kind of continue to plan the business then? Because if you can\'t really plan what\'s coming on-premise, what\'s coming as subscription, I mean, can you help us understand a little bit about the speed that you can see here? Is it like a steady speed? Is it increasing, et cetera? And then, David, can you talk a little bit about, if I look at your investments at the moment and it looks more loaded into – it looks more focused on the first half, can you talk a little bit about the linearity for the year because I still try to get to the full year EPS number? Thank you. David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Sure, Raimo. Let me start with the second question about investments. We did frontload a fair bit of investment this year. And so when you look at it in the aggregate, it would be fair to expect it to actually trend down as we go through the year. And let me point out a couple of things. First, there are incremental costs in period in the first half. For example, our big Synergy event, our Summit event, our partner event, et cetera, those are all first half initiatives. Also, there\'s a fair bit of our ongoing efficiency programs that have been held up a little bit just based on the GoTo spin that\'s done now. So those will float through in the back half of the year, frontloaded marketing and demand spend, things like that. So that\'s how you get to it on a modeling basis. When you step back and think about the overall economic model, it is a shift going on. I think it\'s fair to say that we are managing that. We\'re actually holding it back a little bit. Customer demand and customer conversations are very strongly focused on cloud these days. It\'s aligned with where they\'re going and fortunately it\'s very much aligned with our strategic focus as well. We are focused in 2017 much more on new customers. Of the cloud, in this period, 75% were new, 25% were installed base customers migrating. So that\'s a good dynamic. And we\'re going to keep that focused on net new for now and frankly keep a governor on it because as we\'ve talked about a few times, this is our year to slowly ramp and make sure that we are hardened in the infrastructure areas that we need to be, et cetera. And so we\'ll be building out our processes. And because of that, we\'ll have a better ability to manage the financial model. Our plan right now in May is to – at our Analyst Meeting to talk more about the longer-term economics and how it impacts the model. Obviously, the shift to subscription is a big upside from a customer lifetime value point of view, so the economics look great for us, and we just have to make sure it\'s managed effectively and appropriately within the financial model. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. A question to David and also just Kirill. On the shift to the cloud that\'s obviously impacting the recognized revenue upfront for the Workspace Services business, David, just in terms of the guidance that you guys have obviously reiterated for the full year, it seems to be progressing a little faster than you thought. How should we think about what you\'ve baked in in terms of that shift kind of directionally maybe versus your original expectations? And how – Kirill, too, sort of what is driving this in your opinion? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. In terms of what we\'ve baked in, I mean, and think about the mix that I referred to a couple of times in Q1 with about 20% of bookings coming out of the ratable-type license. There\'s a combination of term-based license, cloud, CSP, et cetera. CSP is – when we think of those kind of one by one, so CSP has been accelerating because we put more investment in that area. We\'ve been investing in the capacity to recruit, onboard and manage those partners, and so that business has accelerated. Term and cloud are really just a function of how customers are looking to purchase software these days. I mean, you\'re seeing this increasing trend towards that, most likely driven by cloud and what a lot of other software vendors are doing from a solution point of view. So it\'s becoming much more common now. We will manage that balance between term and cloud, obviously pushing towards cloud has customers are willing to accept that. But as I was telling Raimo, I think we\'ll manage that this year, keep the focus on new license, a little bit less so on the installed base, and we\'ll save that for when the real acceleration of the transformation over the next few years. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. I think it\'s absolutely correct. And just to build on what David just said, the balance is the key word. Building out of our cloud capabilities is the key word as we\'ll continue in 2017. And it\'s also worth noting the new services that we just launched on Microsoft Azure in their marketplace an opportunity that it creates, and in fact in the SMB segment, that historically we\'ve not been able to reach. We saw some early successes that are really positively surprising to many technical analysts who have been following us, like, for example, a customer who was able to get XenApp going in under four hours. And historically, in virtual client computing, as you\'ve been following it on the technical side, it was just not possible. And now we have a solution that enables that to happen. So we view that as sort of a balanced approach whereas David mentioned we will be regulating it and building out our capacity in the enterprise. At the same time, it opens up new opportunities for us in the lower end. Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Got it. Thanks, guys. David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Thanks, Phil. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thank you very much. David, I was wondering – or Kirill – you mentioned reinvigorating the channel community. I\'m wondering if you could share with us just a little bit more detail on what specific steps there you\'ve made to kind of reinvigorate the channel. And how would you gage your success thus far? And then I just had a follow-up for David. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Well, I think – so, obviously we\'ve been engaged with partners since the beginning of time at Citrix here. And last year we took a very deep view on what else we need to do to enable our partners. And it starts with enablement. It starts with education. It starts with sort of building up to enable their success. Our Summit event in early part of Q1 was a central point of this reinvigoration with also new leadership that we\'ve brought into the program. Some new adjustments to the program that we implemented in 2016 that are now starting to work and starting to pay dividends like our partner-sourced opportunities and shifting of our partner compensation to comp to essentially encourage that behavior. All of the things are in place, and we\'re starting to work. But as I\'m sure you\'re aware, to manage a large partner channel, and we have over 4,000 transacting partners in Q1, it is a process of continuous tweaking, and it\'s a process of continuous enablement and optimization. That\'s precisely what we plan to do for the remainder of the year. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. And then the follow-up for David, if I could, is just if I go back over the last, I don\'t know, probably three or four years, I always feel like Q1 people are usually on point with when you guide Q4, but it seems like we all seem to get Q2 seasonality wrong. And I guess I\'m just wondering, how much of this is the business model shift versus just for your Q2 revenue guidance being a little bit below where people were looking versus kind of the shifting business dynamics that you mentioned? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. I hate to say it but it\'s largely just a modeling exercise. Every year it seems to be the same drill. Because we haven\'t provide Q2 guidance at this point, there\'s a pretty wide range out there. So usually once we get past Q1, it starts to settle out for the balance of the year. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yes. That\'s what I thought. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Great. Thank you. This is Tyler Radke on for Walter. David, I was hoping you could talk to us about the maintenance revenue. I thought it declined sequentially. Could you just kind of walk us through the reason for that? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yes. Maintenance revenues, it\'s got a lot of moving parts in it right now as licenses are moving towards a cloud or subscription, things that are coming out of the base, and that\'ll show up in different parts of the P&L. But I think the more important thing around maintenance right now is you look at the shift that\'s ongoing towards CSS, and that\'s what\'s going to play out over the course starting right now but really over the back half of the year and into the next couple of years. We\'ve talked about this a couple of times is that we\'ve migrated to this new program. It\'s going to provide an incremental revenue stream that we\'ve been estimating north of a couple hundred million dollars layered in over a few years. The reason is that we are metering the increase to customers to not exceed a certain level year by year. I will say though, however, in Q1, the facts are better than what we had been modeling. We\'ve had a faster level of adoption for customers doing a voluntary. In fact, the average ASP from a booking is up about 24% for those customers that are migrating, which is ahead of our original 15% planning estimate. So just one data point – a couple of data points that give us confidence in hitting that transition with probably a more positive outcome than we had originally anticipated. And we\'re just trying really hard to make sure we\'re touching every customer, selling that value. You\'ll see that start to flow through the recognized license piece as we go into the next few quarters. On a billings basis, obviously that\'s one of the things that contributed to the big growth in deferred revenue year-on-year and one of the reasons why billings is outpacing revenue by several percentage points in Q1. Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Great. And then just a follow-up on the cloud side and NetScaler. We\'ve seen some hardware vendors talk about some impact from cloud spending or possibly the competitive environment. I was just hoping you could kind of touch on what you\'ve seen there, if the cloud spending patterns or competitive situation changed at all. David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Sure. Nothing unexpected. I mean, for the last six months, we\'ve been talking about the cyclical patterns that we expect. Given that the first three quarters of last year were extremely strong, we expected two or three quarters of not as strong business as compared year-on-year. One of the stats I called out in my prepared remarks was that on a sequential basis, from Q4 to Q1, that cloud infrastructure spending on NetScaler was up over 100%. And so it is starting to come back, but it\'s compared year-on-year against a monster quarter in Q1 a year ago. So we do expect the growth rates to be higher and stronger and positive in the second half of the year. Just the same thing we\'ve been saying for the last couple of these calls. No real change in the overall competitive environment. Continues to be competitive but nothing unexpected. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yes. And I\'ll just add that this is really the case where we continue to benefit from our software-first approach that enables us to deploy NetScaler in a broad range of form factors, including NetScaler-as-a-Service in both AWS and Azure, NetScaler Docker (31:13) container, and really benefit from this rapid shift to software-defined perimeter where we\'re now increasingly playing a role. Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Abhey Rattan Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Yeah. Thank you. Two questions, David. And the one, what was the impact of greater-than-expected adoption of subscription in this quarter in terms of revenues and earnings? Can you quantify it for the quarter and for the guidance for the year? And secondly, how should we think about cash flow margin for the year? Should there be upside effect from the shift in the model? And was there any onetime impact on cash flows this quarter? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Okay, Abhey, let me parse out all those questions. Take the last one is in terms of onetime impact, there was a big onetime impact to cash flow related to the discontinued operations, really the GetGo spin, that was a negative impact of over $42 million, and so that\'s the largest of the one-offs. Cash flow is a little bit messy this quarter just because of that spin. We\'ll be reporting it on a very clean basis going forward and then calling out the GetGo business as discontinued operations in every prior period. In terms of the actual impact on the quarter, we\'re not prepared to talk about a perpetual equivalent right now or try to normalize that. And I think it\'s a little too early for that given where the financial model is. But I\'d say the best way to look at that in the short term is just the difference between billings and revenue and deferred and deferred expectation. Those are probably the places that I would point you to. If I was looking at it, it would be in probably the ACV terms, and we are starting to measure the business this way. And we\'ll provide that level of incremental metric as we go through our Financial Analyst Meeting and talk about the multiyear transformation. At this point, I\'d rather just keep it very focused on the reported financials. Abhey Rattan Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Got it. Thanks. And what\'s – about the cash flow margin for the year? And that\'s it for me. David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. I think cash flows are actually going to benefit as we go through this. I mean, we\'ve got a couple of dynamics going on. We\'ve talked about them a few times. A lot more in the case of multiyear transactions. We are still billing a large portion of those upfront. We are starting to build a balance of – well, what we can call unbilled backlog or off-balance sheet backlog. We\'re not planning on reporting that at this point. It is measured in the several million dollars this quarter, but it\'s not material at this time. So, fortunately, we\'ll be collecting a lot of cash from these multiyear transactions, and as we go into cloud, it will start to outpace revenue in the short term. Abhey Rattan Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. This is actually Nikolay Beliov sitting in for Kash. You guys mentioned that APJ and EMEA bookings grew double digits and overall billings were up 5%. Can you please speak to the Americas business? That implies that maybe Americas was weaker in Q1. What happened there? Any puts and takes? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. This is the danger of talking about bookings because you\'re combining recognized plus the change in deferred, of course. But if I look at it on a recognized basis, Americas was up 1 point, APJ was up 10 points and EMEA was down a couple points. On a bookings basis, I think the important takeaway is that all three geos exceeded plan. It\'s the first time in a long time we\'ve had all three geos north of 100%. They all had nice positive growth there. So I\'d probably want to just stay at that level and not try to go down too far because the real takeaway is the work that we\'ve been doing in rebuilding the teams, the capacity and some of these execution challenges that we\'ve talked about in the last year or so, really showing great progress. The Americas team has been the growth engine of this business for a long time. They continue to do extremely well, and the improving results you\'ve seen in the international geos are just going to help as we go through the balance of the year. Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it. And as a follow-up, you mentioned that the win rate in Workspaces has been increasing in the marketplace despite the pressure from the shift to subscription. Can you please talk about why are you guys winning at an increasing the rate and how you are differentiated versus VMware? And are you seeing Amazon Workspaces in the marketplace? Thank you. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. It\'s a great question. And we have seen an increased win rate and we have seen the record number of wins this quarter. Obviously, the product is the number one driver. We continue to innovate rapidly with our Xen family. Four releases in 2016, another very significant release in first quarter of 2017, full integration of Unidesk that adds to overall win momentum, and we\'ve seen that it\'s really starting to make a difference. And it\'s very exciting to see. I think our partnership with Microsoft, which essentially now has come to a point of sort of well-run operating machine. We spoke about – at least one win we can name and report. There were many more, and that continues to help. We still have unique capability for virtualizing of Skype for Business. We play very unique role in Windows 10 migrations. And all of that combined has certainly been driving the overall win rate. It\'s also fair to say that our field and our partner channel demonstrate a lot more energy and enthusiasm even compared to what we saw a year ago. And this is all a result of the continuous focus, continuous education and continuous cultural transformation of the company to be more courageous as we take on competitive situations. Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen. Your line is open. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC Okay. Thanks very much and good afternoon, guys. Kirill how would you characterize sales cycle this quarter? And going forward, is there some risk of sales cycle elongation among your installed base as customers perhaps liberate the architecture that makes the most sense for them? How do you see that playing out? And then I just have a follow-up for David. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. I think – I don\'t believe we\'ve seen any material change in the sales cycle in Q1 in our core businesses. I think if we sort of look across the portfolio, I think we\'ve seen probably a slightly accelerated velocity in XenApp, XenDesktop, primarily driven yet again by increased innovation and just by much more focus of being clear on what we deliver and articulating our value proposition with a whole lot more clarity than in the past. I think it\'s also the case where the entire company is being more focused and our strategy being much more aligned with our core product value proposition continued with slightly accelerated deal velocity. In the networking space, in SD-WAN in particular, I would say that this is new market, and I would say it\'s driven by large transactions, and I think this is the place where proof of concepts are taking time, and people are really trying to assess what\'s going on. We continue to stay very focused on that. We\'re very bullish on SD-WAN going forward, and we certainly participate on those proof of concepts with our partners and also educating the channel. So I would say no material change. Slight acceleration in our core business on the deal velocity. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC Great. Thank you. And then just for David, I wanted to confirm because there\'s a little confusion among investors since I don\'t believe we have all the historicals ex GoTo from a balance sheet perspective. Did you say earlier that your total billings growth this quarter was 5% on an apples-to-apples basis? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yes, I did. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the clarification. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you. Got a question for both; one for Kirill, one for David. As you discussed, the Microsoft partnership is helping, but is the partnership yet firing on all the cylinders? Or do you believe the ability, especially relating Azure, to drive acceleration adoption is still ahead of you? And then a follow-up. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. It\'s a great question. I think Microsoft partnership, which has been in place for about a year now, sort of reached a point of operational maturity in most part of the world, and we continue to make it a truly global phenomenon. So I think while it\'s working in major geographies, I think there is opportunity for us to see more upside from that as we expand globally. And as you know, for that partnership, the most important thing is to get the sort of people on the ground in countries to work very closely together, and we continue to make sure it does happen as we made it happen in the center and have very good cadence of engagement. I think there is an upside. Clearly there is an upside in XenApp, XenDesktop Essentials services that were just made available at the end of March on Azure Marketplace. And we view that as a great new opportunity. You can kind of characterize it as a second-party service. It\'s not first-party by Microsoft. It\'s branded Citrix, yet it is sold in Azure Marketplace by Microsoft, and early traction has been significant. And on top of that, at the end of Q2, we plan to make available similar service for XenMobile, which is XenMobile Essentials, which is yet again a multi-tenant, cloud-native service released in Azure Marketplace as essentially a wrap or add-on to Intune and Microsoft EMS. And our sort of early signals from customers who previewed this solution has been incredibly positive and we\'re expecting good uplift from that solution as well. So, great traction so far and yet we absolutely continued to see upside. And obviously with our major customer event coming up next month, we\'re certainly going be unveiling some other interesting tricks that we\'re going to do together with Microsoft. Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Perfect. David, how should we think about the gross margin impact of the cloud shift both on this year and the longer term? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Sure, Mark. I mean, longer term, we\'ll talk about that later in the year. We\'ll preview some of that at our Analyst Meeting, but no impact this year. I think gross margins for 2017 are still going be in that range of 86%, 87% where we\'ve been forecasting all year. Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Excellent. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is open. Tom Mao - Evercore Group LLC Hi. This is Tom Mao on for Kirk. For Kirill, in terms of the booking strength for Workspace Services, do you feel like this is due to better execution on your end or kind of taking share versus competition? Or has there been a broader pickup in spending on desktop delivery technology? And if it\'s a bit of both, can you just provide some context on how we should think about these macro and micro factors? Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. I think there is a broad set of factors. And first and foremost, we\'re a technology company and innovation is the number one driver for any uplift. And this is the case where focus on the core and investing in core product in the last 18 months is clearly paying off. So this is one. A few secular trends, cybersecurity. The fact that more and more customers are viewing virtual client computing as core part of laying down secure and a reliable architecture for their IT is certainly taking place, and we\'re seeing customers choosing XenApp, XenDesktop for securing of their enterprise. And this is across industries, financial services, health care, essentially across the board. Win 10 migration is certainly serving as a sort of very important pivotal point in IQ re-architecture, and through that IQ re-architecture and move to Windows 10. We see customers shifting towards thin clients, whether it\'s a thin client "laptop" with Chromebooks where Citrix has a unique capability to offer to essentially legitimizing Chromebook in the enterprise or whether it\'s something like Raspberry Pi for larger screen type deployment. Yet again we have unique capabilities there through Citrix Receiver baked on a chip. So that\'s taken place. And last but not least, we\'re seeing shifts to Citrix Cloud, and I think that shift is certainly also serving as a catalyst. Historically, we all know that one of the blockers for VDI adoption and for virtual client computing adoption in the enterprise has been complexity of the overall solution. It\'s not the easiest part of IT infrastructure. We also know that in the last five to seven years, we\'ve seen continuous shortage and increased shortage of IT talent. And so now we essentially, with Citrix Cloud, removed that complexity and all of a sudden made it easier for organizations of all sizes to adopt virtual cloud computing and VDI. And that\'s also served as a driver here. So broad range of factors. I think it\'s – last quarter we said that 2016 was the year when we\'ll lay down the foundation for future growth in the core, and now we\'re seeing the results of that foundation being laid out. And all of that, coupled with strong execution in the field, David spoke about much-improved leadership and execution globally. We\'re seeing that taking place. And yet again, our global field organization being much more courageous as they talk on the competition and win against them with stronger product. Tom Mao - Evercore Group LLC And just a follow-up to that, how are you thinking about M&A in terms of helping you continue this transition to the cloud? Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Well, as we\'ve demonstrated in the last 12 months, we\'ve favored tuck-in acquisitions that are clearly immediately benefit our customers and easy for us to integrate. And we always look for more and we look for more opportunities. That relates to sort of cloud foundation. This is really something that a company like Citrix needs to build and needs to own. And we\'ve made huge progress building out Citrix Cloud and really laying down all of the operating tools that enable us to deliver that scale with high velocity. And obviously, we always look for ways to augment it with both parts of infrastructure that can help us and potential future M&A activities that would help us accelerate and add capabilities. Tom Mao - Evercore Group LLC Great. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is open. Austin Dietz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey, guys. This is Austin Dietz phoning in for Michael. How much deployment both on-prem and in the cloud are you seeing with NetScaler VPX? Thanks. David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. NetScaler VPX is still a minority product. I mean, from a volume standpoint, it would obviously be much, much higher than revenue. But on a revenue basis, it\'s generally 10% or 15% of the mix, units, of course, being much, much higher. I don\'t think we have great visibility in terms of whether there – it depends on where the customer purchases them. If they purchase through a marketplace on one the mega clouds, of course, the assumption is it\'s being deployed in the cloud. If they purchase it through a typical license agreement, we\'re not sure exactly where they ultimately deploy that. But I think the bigger takeaway it that it is a software solution and it gives you that flexibility, whether that cloud is a hybrid cloud that you own some of the infrastructure or it\'s a public cloud. And you can move those capabilities around very, very easily. And because we\'re a software-first solution, NetScaler allows you to do that, and whether that\'s VPX in a container focused on DevOps or in a traditional appliance form factor. And so that\'s our strategy from a product point of view. Austin Dietz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the question. David, I had a quick clarifying question on the ARR of $275 million. On the 22% growth that you cited, did that (48:54) impact of the GoTo business, the GoTo portion of ARR? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. No. That\'s totally excluding all GoTo impact. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Great. And then I guess moving to the cloud transition, I think just from a philosophical point of view, is the operating principle in terms of how you\'re going to manage this transition, if the transitions happen faster than you expected, is that something that you guys would be happy with or do you guys feel you need to manage the transition of the cloud to sort of maintain the near-term, intermediate-term financial profile? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Well, I\'d put the financial profile second, and I\'ll explain that in a minute. It\'s more a practical answer when it comes to just making sure that everything necessary to transform a company to a different model is in place. And that\'s true from a technical standpoint, from an infrastructure point of view, from systems and processes and people. And all those things take time. You want to make sure that you get it right so the customer has an amazing experience, and that\'s the primary reason why we meter. If I look at it from a financial point of view, I mean, financially it provides a tremendous amount of upside long term from a customer lifetime value, assuming you get part A of that answer correct. And so that\'s why you\'ve got to start there, get the foundation in place, get the processes in place and then help customers. And we\'ll add a tremendous amount of value when we do that, but that\'s the primary reason why we\'re throttling the growth rates. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Understood. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. I would just add that even the last two quarters, we spoke about our approach to cloud transition being crawl, walk, run, and we certainly in Q1 entered a walk year. And this is a bit of a speed walking, and we will continue to moderate our pace as we go through the year. We also see balanced demand from our customers, and I think the sort of operative word for a cloud transformation in 2017 will be balance. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Understood. That\'s helpful context. And then just a last follow-up, and I know we\'ll probably get into this more on the Analyst Day, but just as a starting point of discussion, in terms of the gross margins on your cloud/ratable business, approximately where do they stand today and where could we see that going once we sort of really start to accelerate in terms of scale? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. I\'d rather just hold off until we can talk about it at scale. It\'s not appropriate at this point. Let\'s stay focused on the 86%, 87% that\'s embedded in our guidance for the full year. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Look forward to the Analyst Day. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from Wells Fargo (sic) [RBC] (51:44). Your line is open. Matthew Swanson - RBC Capital Markets LLC Yeah. This is Matt Swanson on for Matt Hedberg from RBC. Kind of circling back to your comments during the call about cybersecurity becoming increasingly a catalyst, I know you had an article come out earlier in the month talking about GDPR. We hear that a lot from our security companies, maybe a little less from infrastructure. So could you talk a little bit about how GDPR could affect your European business and what products specifically you feel like it\'d be benefiting? Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. That\'s a great question. And having spent a bit of time in EMEA during the quarter, I can certainly attest that GDPR is a big topic of conversation for CIOs and for our people and our partner channel as well. It comes into effect in 2018. We\'re absolutely going to be ready with all of our products and full compliance, and absolutely ready for the new regulation. In our secure file sync and share solution, ShareFile, we have the unique capability. We have the unique capability compared to all of the other cloud-based file sync and share solution, and that is we have an option to deploy in customer managed zones, whether it\'s in the local cloud and whether it\'s on-prem. And I think this is certainly the case where ShareFile is likely going to be the beneficiary of this new regulation on an ongoing basis. Matthew Swanson - RBC Capital Markets LLC That\'s great. And then if I could just have one follow-up. We talked a lot obviously about the shift towards more subscription and also a lot about the Microsoft partnership. With so many of their products now going cloud or subscription-based, do you feel like that partnership is at all accelerating this transition for you? Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. I think this is certainly the case where Microsoft, along with other cloud infrastructure providers, has played a pivotal role in effectively convincing enterprises that cloud is something that they need to embrace. I think this is also the case where continuous improvement and performance, scalability and security of cloud offerings, whether it\'s driven by Microsoft or other cloud providers, is also serving as a catalyst of the broader cloud adoption and customers of all sizes. So we have certainly seen this. We have certainly absolutely seen this. Also, Microsoft has been incredibly focused on Azure as a company, and that has certainly been a driver and been a catalyst for the overall broader cloud transformation in Microsoft customer base, where effectively we have a very, very strong presence. So, yes, indirectly it has been a driver and it continues to be a driver. Matthew Swanson - RBC Capital Markets LLC All right. Thank you for your time. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Thank you. David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Thanks, Matt. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks. David, in the cash flow statement in the first quarter here there was a deferred tax item that added about $67.5 million. What\'s that related to and will it reverse over the course of the year? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yes, I\'d have to follow up with you on the detail of that. It\'s related to the GetGo spin, but in terms of how much of that is embedded, we\'ll follow up on that. If you look down the financial statement, it should be netted out by the impact of discontinuing operations. Brad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. But below the line on – or is that in cash flow from ops? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah, cash flow from ops. We\'ll follow up with you on much more granularity though. Brad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Thank you. Operator There are no further questions at this time. I\'d like to turn the call back over to the presenters. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us today, and thank you for following Citrix as we continue in our journey to transform the company. The new Citrix has clearly taken shape in the last few quarters and we look into the future with high degree of confidence, excitement and enthusiasm. Our vision is clear, our strategy is focused, and our execution and innovation engines are working well. We look forward to seeing you next month in Orlando for a deeper discussion on cloud transformation and future prospects. Thank you, all, very much.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Operator Your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I have two quick questions. First of all, the speed of the transition towards more subscriptions seems to be picking up here. Can you think about how you kind of continue to plan the business then? Because if you can\'t really plan what\'s coming on-premise, what\'s coming as subscription, I mean, can you help us understand a little bit about the speed that you can see here? Is it like a steady speed? Is it increasing, et cetera? And then, David, can you talk a little bit about, if I look at your investments at the moment and it looks more loaded into – it looks more focused on the first half, can you talk a little bit about the linearity for the year because I still try to get to the full year EPS number? Thank you. David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Sure, Raimo. Let me start with the second question about investments. We did frontload a fair bit of investment this year. And so when you look at it in the aggregate, it would be fair to expect it to actually trend down as we go through the year. And let me point out a couple of things. First, there are incremental costs in period in the first half. For example, our big Synergy event, our Summit event, our partner event, et cetera, those are all first half initiatives. Also, there\'s a fair bit of our ongoing efficiency programs that have been held up a little bit just based on the GoTo spin that\'s done now. So those will float through in the back half of the year, frontloaded marketing and demand spend, things like that. So that\'s how you get to it on a modeling basis. When you step back and think about the overall economic model, it is a shift going on. I think it\'s fair to say that we are managing that. We\'re actually holding it back a little bit. Customer demand and customer conversations are very strongly focused on cloud these days. It\'s aligned with where they\'re going and fortunately it\'s very much aligned with our strategic focus as well. We are focused in 2017 much more on new customers. Of the cloud, in this period, 75% were new, 25% were installed base customers migrating. So that\'s a good dynamic. And we\'re going to keep that focused on net new for now and frankly keep a governor on it because as we\'ve talked about a few times, this is our year to slowly ramp and make sure that we are hardened in the infrastructure areas that we need to be, et cetera. And so we\'ll be building out our processes. And because of that, we\'ll have a better ability to manage the financial model. Our plan right now in May is to – at our Analyst Meeting to talk more about the longer-term economics and how it impacts the model. Obviously, the shift to subscription is a big upside from a customer lifetime value point of view, so the economics look great for us, and we just have to make sure it\'s managed effectively and appropriately within the financial model. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. A question to David and also just Kirill. On the shift to the cloud that\'s obviously impacting the recognized revenue upfront for the Workspace Services business, David, just in terms of the guidance that you guys have obviously reiterated for the full year, it seems to be progressing a little faster than you thought. How should we think about what you\'ve baked in in terms of that shift kind of directionally maybe versus your original expectations? And how – Kirill, too, sort of what is driving this in your opinion? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. In terms of what we\'ve baked in, I mean, and think about the mix that I referred to a couple of times in Q1 with about 20% of bookings coming out of the ratable-type license. There\'s a combination of term-based license, cloud, CSP, et cetera. CSP is – when we think of those kind of one by one, so CSP has been accelerating because we put more investment in that area. We\'ve been investing in the capacity to recruit, onboard and manage those partners, and so that business has accelerated. Term and cloud are really just a function of how customers are looking to purchase software these days. I mean, you\'re seeing this increasing trend towards that, most likely driven by cloud and what a lot of other software vendors are doing from a solution point of view. So it\'s becoming much more common now. We will manage that balance between term and cloud, obviously pushing towards cloud has customers are willing to accept that. But as I was telling Raimo, I think we\'ll manage that this year, keep the focus on new license, a little bit less so on the installed base, and we\'ll save that for when the real acceleration of the transformation over the next few years. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. I think it\'s absolutely correct. And just to build on what David just said, the balance is the key word. Building out of our cloud capabilities is the key word as we\'ll continue in 2017. And it\'s also worth noting the new services that we just launched on Microsoft Azure in their marketplace an opportunity that it creates, and in fact in the SMB segment, that historically we\'ve not been able to reach. We saw some early successes that are really positively surprising to many technical analysts who have been following us, like, for example, a customer who was able to get XenApp going in under four hours. And historically, in virtual client computing, as you\'ve been following it on the technical side, it was just not possible. And now we have a solution that enables that to happen. So we view that as sort of a balanced approach whereas David mentioned we will be regulating it and building out our capacity in the enterprise. At the same time, it opens up new opportunities for us in the lower end. Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Got it. Thanks, guys. David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Thanks, Phil. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thank you very much. David, I was wondering – or Kirill – you mentioned reinvigorating the channel community. I\'m wondering if you could share with us just a little bit more detail on what specific steps there you\'ve made to kind of reinvigorate the channel. And how would you gage your success thus far? And then I just had a follow-up for David. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Well, I think – so, obviously we\'ve been engaged with partners since the beginning of time at Citrix here. And last year we took a very deep view on what else we need to do to enable our partners. And it starts with enablement. It starts with education. It starts with sort of building up to enable their success. Our Summit event in early part of Q1 was a central point of this reinvigoration with also new leadership that we\'ve brought into the program. Some new adjustments to the program that we implemented in 2016 that are now starting to work and starting to pay dividends like our partner-sourced opportunities and shifting of our partner compensation to comp to essentially encourage that behavior. All of the things are in place, and we\'re starting to work. But as I\'m sure you\'re aware, to manage a large partner channel, and we have over 4,000 transacting partners in Q1, it is a process of continuous tweaking, and it\'s a process of continuous enablement and optimization. That\'s precisely what we plan to do for the remainder of the year. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. And then the follow-up for David, if I could, is just if I go back over the last, I don\'t know, probably three or four years, I always feel like Q1 people are usually on point with when you guide Q4, but it seems like we all seem to get Q2 seasonality wrong. And I guess I\'m just wondering, how much of this is the business model shift versus just for your Q2 revenue guidance being a little bit below where people were looking versus kind of the shifting business dynamics that you mentioned? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. I hate to say it but it\'s largely just a modeling exercise. Every year it seems to be the same drill. Because we haven\'t provide Q2 guidance at this point, there\'s a pretty wide range out there. So usually once we get past Q1, it starts to settle out for the balance of the year. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yes. That\'s what I thought. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Great. Thank you. This is Tyler Radke on for Walter. David, I was hoping you could talk to us about the maintenance revenue. I thought it declined sequentially. Could you just kind of walk us through the reason for that? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yes. Maintenance revenues, it\'s got a lot of moving parts in it right now as licenses are moving towards a cloud or subscription, things that are coming out of the base, and that\'ll show up in different parts of the P&L. But I think the more important thing around maintenance right now is you look at the shift that\'s ongoing towards CSS, and that\'s what\'s going to play out over the course starting right now but really over the back half of the year and into the next couple of years. We\'ve talked about this a couple of times is that we\'ve migrated to this new program. It\'s going to provide an incremental revenue stream that we\'ve been estimating north of a couple hundred million dollars layered in over a few years. The reason is that we are metering the increase to customers to not exceed a certain level year by year. I will say though, however, in Q1, the facts are better than what we had been modeling. We\'ve had a faster level of adoption for customers doing a voluntary. In fact, the average ASP from a booking is up about 24% for those customers that are migrating, which is ahead of our original 15% planning estimate. So just one data point – a couple of data points that give us confidence in hitting that transition with probably a more positive outcome than we had originally anticipated. And we\'re just trying really hard to make sure we\'re touching every customer, selling that value. You\'ll see that start to flow through the recognized license piece as we go into the next few quarters. On a billings basis, obviously that\'s one of the things that contributed to the big growth in deferred revenue year-on-year and one of the reasons why billings is outpacing revenue by several percentage points in Q1. Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Great. And then just a follow-up on the cloud side and NetScaler. We\'ve seen some hardware vendors talk about some impact from cloud spending or possibly the competitive environment. I was just hoping you could kind of touch on what you\'ve seen there, if the cloud spending patterns or competitive situation changed at all. David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Sure. Nothing unexpected. I mean, for the last six months, we\'ve been talking about the cyclical patterns that we expect. Given that the first three quarters of last year were extremely strong, we expected two or three quarters of not as strong business as compared year-on-year. One of the stats I called out in my prepared remarks was that on a sequential basis, from Q4 to Q1, that cloud infrastructure spending on NetScaler was up over 100%. And so it is starting to come back, but it\'s compared year-on-year against a monster quarter in Q1 a year ago. So we do expect the growth rates to be higher and stronger and positive in the second half of the year. Just the same thing we\'ve been saying for the last couple of these calls. No real change in the overall competitive environment. Continues to be competitive but nothing unexpected. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yes. And I\'ll just add that this is really the case where we continue to benefit from our software-first approach that enables us to deploy NetScaler in a broad range of form factors, including NetScaler-as-a-Service in both AWS and Azure, NetScaler Docker (31:13) container, and really benefit from this rapid shift to software-defined perimeter where we\'re now increasingly playing a role. Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Abhey Rattan Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Yeah. Thank you. Two questions, David. And the one, what was the impact of greater-than-expected adoption of subscription in this quarter in terms of revenues and earnings? Can you quantify it for the quarter and for the guidance for the year? And secondly, how should we think about cash flow margin for the year? Should there be upside effect from the shift in the model? And was there any onetime impact on cash flows this quarter? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Okay, Abhey, let me parse out all those questions. Take the last one is in terms of onetime impact, there was a big onetime impact to cash flow related to the discontinued operations, really the GetGo spin, that was a negative impact of over $42 million, and so that\'s the largest of the one-offs. Cash flow is a little bit messy this quarter just because of that spin. We\'ll be reporting it on a very clean basis going forward and then calling out the GetGo business as discontinued operations in every prior period. In terms of the actual impact on the quarter, we\'re not prepared to talk about a perpetual equivalent right now or try to normalize that. And I think it\'s a little too early for that given where the financial model is. But I\'d say the best way to look at that in the short term is just the difference between billings and revenue and deferred and deferred expectation. Those are probably the places that I would point you to. If I was looking at it, it would be in probably the ACV terms, and we are starting to measure the business this way. And we\'ll provide that level of incremental metric as we go through our Financial Analyst Meeting and talk about the multiyear transformation. At this point, I\'d rather just keep it very focused on the reported financials. Abhey Rattan Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Got it. Thanks. And what\'s – about the cash flow margin for the year? And that\'s it for me. David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. I think cash flows are actually going to benefit as we go through this. I mean, we\'ve got a couple of dynamics going on. We\'ve talked about them a few times. A lot more in the case of multiyear transactions. We are still billing a large portion of those upfront. We are starting to build a balance of – well, what we can call unbilled backlog or off-balance sheet backlog. We\'re not planning on reporting that at this point. It is measured in the several million dollars this quarter, but it\'s not material at this time. So, fortunately, we\'ll be collecting a lot of cash from these multiyear transactions, and as we go into cloud, it will start to outpace revenue in the short term. Abhey Rattan Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. This is actually Nikolay Beliov sitting in for Kash. You guys mentioned that APJ and EMEA bookings grew double digits and overall billings were up 5%. Can you please speak to the Americas business? That implies that maybe Americas was weaker in Q1. What happened there? Any puts and takes? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. This is the danger of talking about bookings because you\'re combining recognized plus the change in deferred, of course. But if I look at it on a recognized basis, Americas was up 1 point, APJ was up 10 points and EMEA was down a couple points. On a bookings basis, I think the important takeaway is that all three geos exceeded plan. It\'s the first time in a long time we\'ve had all three geos north of 100%. They all had nice positive growth there. So I\'d probably want to just stay at that level and not try to go down too far because the real takeaway is the work that we\'ve been doing in rebuilding the teams, the capacity and some of these execution challenges that we\'ve talked about in the last year or so, really showing great progress. The Americas team has been the growth engine of this business for a long time. They continue to do extremely well, and the improving results you\'ve seen in the international geos are just going to help as we go through the balance of the year. Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it. And as a follow-up, you mentioned that the win rate in Workspaces has been increasing in the marketplace despite the pressure from the shift to subscription. Can you please talk about why are you guys winning at an increasing the rate and how you are differentiated versus VMware? And are you seeing Amazon Workspaces in the marketplace? Thank you. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. It\'s a great question. And we have seen an increased win rate and we have seen the record number of wins this quarter. Obviously, the product is the number one driver. We continue to innovate rapidly with our Xen family. Four releases in 2016, another very significant release in first quarter of 2017, full integration of Unidesk that adds to overall win momentum, and we\'ve seen that it\'s really starting to make a difference. And it\'s very exciting to see. I think our partnership with Microsoft, which essentially now has come to a point of sort of well-run operating machine. We spoke about – at least one win we can name and report. There were many more, and that continues to help. We still have unique capability for virtualizing of Skype for Business. We play very unique role in Windows 10 migrations. And all of that combined has certainly been driving the overall win rate. It\'s also fair to say that our field and our partner channel demonstrate a lot more energy and enthusiasm even compared to what we saw a year ago. And this is all a result of the continuous focus, continuous education and continuous cultural transformation of the company to be more courageous as we take on competitive situations. Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen. Your line is open. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC Okay. Thanks very much and good afternoon, guys. Kirill how would you characterize sales cycle this quarter? And going forward, is there some risk of sales cycle elongation among your installed base as customers perhaps liberate the architecture that makes the most sense for them? How do you see that playing out? And then I just have a follow-up for David. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. I think – I don\'t believe we\'ve seen any material change in the sales cycle in Q1 in our core businesses. I think if we sort of look across the portfolio, I think we\'ve seen probably a slightly accelerated velocity in XenApp, XenDesktop, primarily driven yet again by increased innovation and just by much more focus of being clear on what we deliver and articulating our value proposition with a whole lot more clarity than in the past. I think it\'s also the case where the entire company is being more focused and our strategy being much more aligned with our core product value proposition continued with slightly accelerated deal velocity. In the networking space, in SD-WAN in particular, I would say that this is new market, and I would say it\'s driven by large transactions, and I think this is the place where proof of concepts are taking time, and people are really trying to assess what\'s going on. We continue to stay very focused on that. We\'re very bullish on SD-WAN going forward, and we certainly participate on those proof of concepts with our partners and also educating the channel. So I would say no material change. Slight acceleration in our core business on the deal velocity. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC Great. Thank you. And then just for David, I wanted to confirm because there\'s a little confusion among investors since I don\'t believe we have all the historicals ex GoTo from a balance sheet perspective. Did you say earlier that your total billings growth this quarter was 5% on an apples-to-apples basis? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yes, I did. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the clarification. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you. Got a question for both; one for Kirill, one for David. As you discussed, the Microsoft partnership is helping, but is the partnership yet firing on all the cylinders? Or do you believe the ability, especially relating Azure, to drive acceleration adoption is still ahead of you? And then a follow-up. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. It\'s a great question. I think Microsoft partnership, which has been in place for about a year now, sort of reached a point of operational maturity in most part of the world, and we continue to make it a truly global phenomenon. So I think while it\'s working in major geographies, I think there is opportunity for us to see more upside from that as we expand globally. And as you know, for that partnership, the most important thing is to get the sort of people on the ground in countries to work very closely together, and we continue to make sure it does happen as we made it happen in the center and have very good cadence of engagement. I think there is an upside. Clearly there is an upside in XenApp, XenDesktop Essentials services that were just made available at the end of March on Azure Marketplace. And we view that as a great new opportunity. You can kind of characterize it as a second-party service. It\'s not first-party by Microsoft. It\'s branded Citrix, yet it is sold in Azure Marketplace by Microsoft, and early traction has been significant. And on top of that, at the end of Q2, we plan to make available similar service for XenMobile, which is XenMobile Essentials, which is yet again a multi-tenant, cloud-native service released in Azure Marketplace as essentially a wrap or add-on to Intune and Microsoft EMS. And our sort of early signals from customers who previewed this solution has been incredibly positive and we\'re expecting good uplift from that solution as well. So, great traction so far and yet we absolutely continued to see upside. And obviously with our major customer event coming up next month, we\'re certainly going be unveiling some other interesting tricks that we\'re going to do together with Microsoft. Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Perfect. David, how should we think about the gross margin impact of the cloud shift both on this year and the longer term? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Sure, Mark. I mean, longer term, we\'ll talk about that later in the year. We\'ll preview some of that at our Analyst Meeting, but no impact this year. I think gross margins for 2017 are still going be in that range of 86%, 87% where we\'ve been forecasting all year. Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Excellent. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is open. Tom Mao - Evercore Group LLC Hi. This is Tom Mao on for Kirk. For Kirill, in terms of the booking strength for Workspace Services, do you feel like this is due to better execution on your end or kind of taking share versus competition? Or has there been a broader pickup in spending on desktop delivery technology? And if it\'s a bit of both, can you just provide some context on how we should think about these macro and micro factors? Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. I think there is a broad set of factors. And first and foremost, we\'re a technology company and innovation is the number one driver for any uplift. And this is the case where focus on the core and investing in core product in the last 18 months is clearly paying off. So this is one. A few secular trends, cybersecurity. The fact that more and more customers are viewing virtual client computing as core part of laying down secure and a reliable architecture for their IT is certainly taking place, and we\'re seeing customers choosing XenApp, XenDesktop for securing of their enterprise. And this is across industries, financial services, health care, essentially across the board. Win 10 migration is certainly serving as a sort of very important pivotal point in IQ re-architecture, and through that IQ re-architecture and move to Windows 10. We see customers shifting towards thin clients, whether it\'s a thin client "laptop" with Chromebooks where Citrix has a unique capability to offer to essentially legitimizing Chromebook in the enterprise or whether it\'s something like Raspberry Pi for larger screen type deployment. Yet again we have unique capabilities there through Citrix Receiver baked on a chip. So that\'s taken place. And last but not least, we\'re seeing shifts to Citrix Cloud, and I think that shift is certainly also serving as a catalyst. Historically, we all know that one of the blockers for VDI adoption and for virtual client computing adoption in the enterprise has been complexity of the overall solution. It\'s not the easiest part of IT infrastructure. We also know that in the last five to seven years, we\'ve seen continuous shortage and increased shortage of IT talent. And so now we essentially, with Citrix Cloud, removed that complexity and all of a sudden made it easier for organizations of all sizes to adopt virtual cloud computing and VDI. And that\'s also served as a driver here. So broad range of factors. I think it\'s – last quarter we said that 2016 was the year when we\'ll lay down the foundation for future growth in the core, and now we\'re seeing the results of that foundation being laid out. And all of that, coupled with strong execution in the field, David spoke about much-improved leadership and execution globally. We\'re seeing that taking place. And yet again, our global field organization being much more courageous as they talk on the competition and win against them with stronger product. Tom Mao - Evercore Group LLC And just a follow-up to that, how are you thinking about M&A in terms of helping you continue this transition to the cloud? Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Well, as we\'ve demonstrated in the last 12 months, we\'ve favored tuck-in acquisitions that are clearly immediately benefit our customers and easy for us to integrate. And we always look for more and we look for more opportunities. That relates to sort of cloud foundation. This is really something that a company like Citrix needs to build and needs to own. And we\'ve made huge progress building out Citrix Cloud and really laying down all of the operating tools that enable us to deliver that scale with high velocity. And obviously, we always look for ways to augment it with both parts of infrastructure that can help us and potential future M&A activities that would help us accelerate and add capabilities. Tom Mao - Evercore Group LLC Great. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is open. Austin Dietz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey, guys. This is Austin Dietz phoning in for Michael. How much deployment both on-prem and in the cloud are you seeing with NetScaler VPX? Thanks. David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. NetScaler VPX is still a minority product. I mean, from a volume standpoint, it would obviously be much, much higher than revenue. But on a revenue basis, it\'s generally 10% or 15% of the mix, units, of course, being much, much higher. I don\'t think we have great visibility in terms of whether there – it depends on where the customer purchases them. If they purchase through a marketplace on one the mega clouds, of course, the assumption is it\'s being deployed in the cloud. If they purchase it through a typical license agreement, we\'re not sure exactly where they ultimately deploy that. But I think the bigger takeaway it that it is a software solution and it gives you that flexibility, whether that cloud is a hybrid cloud that you own some of the infrastructure or it\'s a public cloud. And you can move those capabilities around very, very easily. And because we\'re a software-first solution, NetScaler allows you to do that, and whether that\'s VPX in a container focused on DevOps or in a traditional appliance form factor. And so that\'s our strategy from a product point of view. Austin Dietz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the question. David, I had a quick clarifying question on the ARR of $275 million. On the 22% growth that you cited, did that (48:54) impact of the GoTo business, the GoTo portion of ARR? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. No. That\'s totally excluding all GoTo impact. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Great. And then I guess moving to the cloud transition, I think just from a philosophical point of view, is the operating principle in terms of how you\'re going to manage this transition, if the transitions happen faster than you expected, is that something that you guys would be happy with or do you guys feel you need to manage the transition of the cloud to sort of maintain the near-term, intermediate-term financial profile? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Well, I\'d put the financial profile second, and I\'ll explain that in a minute. It\'s more a practical answer when it comes to just making sure that everything necessary to transform a company to a different model is in place. And that\'s true from a technical standpoint, from an infrastructure point of view, from systems and processes and people. And all those things take time. You want to make sure that you get it right so the customer has an amazing experience, and that\'s the primary reason why we meter. If I look at it from a financial point of view, I mean, financially it provides a tremendous amount of upside long term from a customer lifetime value, assuming you get part A of that answer correct. And so that\'s why you\'ve got to start there, get the foundation in place, get the processes in place and then help customers. And we\'ll add a tremendous amount of value when we do that, but that\'s the primary reason why we\'re throttling the growth rates. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Understood. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. I would just add that even the last two quarters, we spoke about our approach to cloud transition being crawl, walk, run, and we certainly in Q1 entered a walk year. And this is a bit of a speed walking, and we will continue to moderate our pace as we go through the year. We also see balanced demand from our customers, and I think the sort of operative word for a cloud transformation in 2017 will be balance. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Understood. That\'s helpful context. And then just a last follow-up, and I know we\'ll probably get into this more on the Analyst Day, but just as a starting point of discussion, in terms of the gross margins on your cloud/ratable business, approximately where do they stand today and where could we see that going once we sort of really start to accelerate in terms of scale? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. I\'d rather just hold off until we can talk about it at scale. It\'s not appropriate at this point. Let\'s stay focused on the 86%, 87% that\'s embedded in our guidance for the full year. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Look forward to the Analyst Day. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from Wells Fargo (sic) [RBC] (51:44). Your line is open. Matthew Swanson - RBC Capital Markets LLC Yeah. This is Matt Swanson on for Matt Hedberg from RBC. Kind of circling back to your comments during the call about cybersecurity becoming increasingly a catalyst, I know you had an article come out earlier in the month talking about GDPR. We hear that a lot from our security companies, maybe a little less from infrastructure. So could you talk a little bit about how GDPR could affect your European business and what products specifically you feel like it\'d be benefiting? Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah. That\'s a great question. And having spent a bit of time in EMEA during the quarter, I can certainly attest that GDPR is a big topic of conversation for CIOs and for our people and our partner channel as well. It comes into effect in 2018. We\'re absolutely going to be ready with all of our products and full compliance, and absolutely ready for the new regulation. In our secure file sync and share solution, ShareFile, we have the unique capability. We have the unique capability compared to all of the other cloud-based file sync and share solution, and that is we have an option to deploy in customer managed zones, whether it\'s in the local cloud and whether it\'s on-prem. And I think this is certainly the case where ShareFile is likely going to be the beneficiary of this new regulation on an ongoing basis. Matthew Swanson - RBC Capital Markets LLC That\'s great. And then if I could just have one follow-up. We talked a lot obviously about the shift towards more subscription and also a lot about the Microsoft partnership. With so many of their products now going cloud or subscription-based, do you feel like that partnership is at all accelerating this transition for you? Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. I think this is certainly the case where Microsoft, along with other cloud infrastructure providers, has played a pivotal role in effectively convincing enterprises that cloud is something that they need to embrace. I think this is also the case where continuous improvement and performance, scalability and security of cloud offerings, whether it\'s driven by Microsoft or other cloud providers, is also serving as a catalyst of the broader cloud adoption and customers of all sizes. So we have certainly seen this. We have certainly absolutely seen this. Also, Microsoft has been incredibly focused on Azure as a company, and that has certainly been a driver and been a catalyst for the overall broader cloud transformation in Microsoft customer base, where effectively we have a very, very strong presence. So, yes, indirectly it has been a driver and it continues to be a driver. Matthew Swanson - RBC Capital Markets LLC All right. Thank you for your time. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Thank you. David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Thanks, Matt. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks. David, in the cash flow statement in the first quarter here there was a deferred tax item that added about $67.5 million. What\'s that related to and will it reverse over the course of the year? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yes, I\'d have to follow up with you on the detail of that. It\'s related to the GetGo spin, but in terms of how much of that is embedded, we\'ll follow up on that. If you look down the financial statement, it should be netted out by the impact of discontinuing operations. Brad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. But below the line on – or is that in cash flow from ops? David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc. Yeah, cash flow from ops. We\'ll follow up with you on much more granularity though. Brad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Thank you. Operator There are no further questions at this time. I\'d like to turn the call back over to the presenters. Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us today, and thank you for following Citrix as we continue in our journey to transform the company. The new Citrix has clearly taken shape in the last few quarters and we look into the future with high degree of confidence, excitement and enthusiasm. Our vision is clear, our strategy is focused, and our execution and innovation engines are working well. We look forward to seeing you next month in Orlando for a deeper discussion on cloud transformation and future prospects. Thank you, all, very much.

Today's speaker will be Mr. Mark Bristow, Randgold's CEO. Sir, please go ahead. Mark Bristow Thank you very much, and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, both in the U.S. and across the pond here in U.K., and Europe, and see some callers in from South Africa as well. As you know, today, at lunchtime, we announced our or presented our quarter 1 results for 2017. And the objective of this call is to catch you up, do a brief update along the lines of what we presented at mid-day. But I would point out that the webcast is available on our Web site, the full transcript for lunchtime. I'll start with just with a little intro on the industry and the gold, and its recent performance. And one of the comments that I made today was, when you look at the current market there is certainly a recovery in it. But as an industry, we still seem to be hogtied by the damage to our valuations and businesses in the past sort of five-and-a-half to seven years. And there's this tentative move towards joint ventures and mergers, and an attempt to keep away from any robust decisions. And my concern is that this industry is becoming a coalition or running the risk of becoming a coalition, which would make us incapable of offering the market a range of clear-cut differentiated investment opportunities. Randgold, on the other hand, has a very distinctive business model, designed to create and deliver value to its stakeholders through its longstanding strategy and from a sustainably [ph] profitable platform. And when you look at this first quarter, it really does talk to all aspects of our strategy. And again, just to catch up, quarter 1 is always a busy quarter for us. And where we re-look at our five-year and 10-year plans, we have now those in a rolling plan program, and we also look particularly at our skills development and how that fits into our scenarios and our plans to ensure that we are well-equipped to continue to deliver. Question 1 was one of our better first quarters for some four to five years, this quarter, with operations delivering across the border, as I pointed out. And all aspects of our business are running to plan, and that doesn't often happen in the mining industry. And so we're very pleased with the outcome of all the results of the quarter. A quick catch-up, the next side is, that's slide two, is the safety, health, and environment slide, as you can see, how we reduced our totally injury frequency rate again, and made further progress on our drive to eradicate malaria in our communities and amongst our workforce. And we're also pleased to be able to demonstrate we are using water and power ever more efficiently. The fourth quarter of last year, as you'll recall, was a record one in every way. As we know, we had to pull up our socks and pull out all the stops to deliver on our guidance, which we did as per our plan we revised in mid-year of 2016. And so, I would argue that the quarter-on-quarter correlation is a little skewed, but the appropriate measure is to compare it with the comparative quarter one of last year. And by that measure, gold production profited total cash cost all improved. Every operation delivered on plan, as I pointed out, and our cash pile grew to past the $600 million mark. And just to put that in context, our shareholders did approve a 52% increase in annual dividend to $1.00, and we will be paying that out this month, and even after that we'll still be well north of $500 million with no debt. We also, as you would've seen recently, published reserves and resource segments which effectively underscore the fact that we had replaced our reserves at a higher grade. And I think that was critical. Another key component of our strategy is the quality of our assets. And our Brownfield's exploration teams continue to build the base, while the Greenfields is making good progress, and I'll touch on that as we go through the presentation. Numbers always tell the story, and we're showing a two-year comparison in this slide just to illustrate the continuing progress we've been making on all fronts, not only on a year-on-year basis, quarterly, but a [indiscernible] and the same trend is observable if you go back in the years. We turn now to operations, starting with our Loulo-Gounkoto flagship, which delivered another solid performance. This business continues to run at a steady state, and even the impact of a [technical difficulty] did not deflect it from hitting all its targets for the quarter. If you look at the operating results, these are the numbers. And if you look at the run rate there, well ahead of our guidance in both production and costs. And Loulo has really started very much like it started last year, and we're happy that it'll achieve its guidance of 690,000 ounces at total cash cost of $550 an ounce. Looking at Loulo on a standalone basis, it's clear that its underground mines are delivering in line with expectations. And despite its record production in 2016, its reserves actually increased by 13% net of depletion on the back of the work that we did in the extensions to the high-grade zones of [technical difficulty] into reserves. Changeover to owner mining; continues to deliver the goods, with a good all-round improvement in the development rate, and Gara, in particular, doing very well. Balancing its different ore types for the feed to the plant has always been a challenge for Loulo, and we're just showing how the improvement that we've had on the back of our initiative to integrate metallurgical and mineral resource management to ensure proactive recognition and accommodation of any variability's in the ore feed. This has lifted our recovery grade to plus-92%, which is excellent by any measure. And later on, I'll show you we've been applying this in Kibali too, and we really are starting to make progress there. Loulo results speak for themselves, as do the complex, pretty much a see-through set of results. And it's worth pointing out the low-cost profile of this business. In addition to the Brownfield's work at Helier North and Gara South, I mentioned earlier, the exploration team also advanced an exciting new target. We have not quite at the discovery level yet, but it's located to the north of Gara along the same corridor, and we currently have defined four kilometers. It's been quite a challenging program to look through some fairly think cover, but we're quite excited about this. And we've certainly got some early initial [technical difficulty] supporting mineralization, and more significantly where we intersect it or exposes on surface we're seeing very much a Gara-style [indiscernible]. Also, in the exploration agenda has been the Loulo 3 target, where we really are starting to delineate what could be an additional underground resource for the Loulo operations. And Loulo is moving into Loulo's sister operation at Gounkoto. It also produced a solid performance after overcoming last year's rate stripping ratio, and work now is progressing with the development of the Super Pit. And these are the numbers, again all in line, and again, underpinning a strong cost discipline and underlying results. Brownfield's work at Gounkoto has highlighted new extension in the form of the MZ4 Plunge [ph]. Initial drilling is being completed, and further work is planned to fully evaluate the deeper potential of this ore shoot. And now the Loulo district has already richly rewarded Randgold. It's really a significant series of world-class deposits, and complementary satellite deposits. And we're still very motivated to make additional discoveries believing in the continued prospectivity of this 70-plus kilometer strike of ore structure. Staying in Mali, but moving down to Morila, we saw increased gold production from the Morila tailings retreatment operation, and an improvement in efficiency, and very comforting, and again, as the third time that the industry has re-cut its cost base and being able to demonstrate its ability the mine ever lower feed grades. And it's encouraging to be able to say that Randgold is learning to manage very low-grade deposits as we do high-grade deposits. Again, the results show a return to profitability, and on the back of these efficiencies we are comfortable to get to our $900 guidance by the end of the year. And you will have seen that we have announced the community approval for the development of the Domba satellite. This could add as much as 30,000 ounces to this year's production, and bring the cost down to sort of mid-$700 range. And also, we have exercised our option to acquire Birimian's -- the next door Birimian's small Ntiola and Viper satellite deposits. And again, that has an opportunity to bank the profitability, and the ability for the mine to coast into a successful closure, and support the legacy initiatives that we've got post mining legacy [indiscernible]. Across now to Senegal, where we're in the process of completing the detailed drilling for the Massawa project bankable feasibility study, we're on track with that. You would've seen that the reserves increased to 2.6 million ounces, and on the back of the significant 40% increase in grade, driven both by the Massawa central zone drilling as well as the additional Sofia reserves. We're doing a lot of work on additional opportunities, and results today have strengthened our belief that there's a significant potential for expanding both the Sofia resources. And along there Sofia struck, and also in surrounding satellite deposits, as you see in this slide. And the same goes for the Massawa targets. We've got some very interesting inventory targets that we had previously defined as part of our early work in this permit. And they were parked because they were not quite big enough to take us to a project decision. But now that we've got this project rapidly approaching our hurdle rates, we've gone back to those satellite deposits, and we're confident that we'll be able to at least convert some of them into the mining change. Moving into Cote d'Ivoire and Tongon; Tongon had a particularly good quarter and despite a nine-day work stoppage delivered a stellar set of results and the most significant being the cost controls as you see here, if you compare just to the December quarter as well as the similar quarter of last year, a good performance and again you know well on its way to meet its guidance of 285 ounces at 680 already, we are just under the run rate, we are guiding sort of 70,000 to 75,000 ounces a quarter for the next three quarters. And if you look at the financials you will see that there's every reason why we should be able to beat the $680 guidance per ounce. We're not -- our focus at Tongon has already shifted to how can we extend the life of the mine not only in new discoveries but just really pulling partly known modules on the edges of the current wells that we are mining and this is a good example of big walk area that has some potential to be able to deliver additional resources reported in. So that is one of our focus drilling programs. We're also continuing to focus on delineating satellite deposits within trucking distance of the blog and as you can imagine any improvements on efficiencies as we've seen this quarter makes those bits more vital even the lower grade ones and it's also starts getting to a point where this logic to go and re-look at these changes where the ore body does continue at it. I said before that the Cote d'Ivoire is a favorite hunting ground, and up on the [indiscernible] particularly rich and potential and we're already been working systematically through targets with the focus more to the South and Central but recently we shifted up and in particular to the North and Northwest, a lot of the extensions of the Siama [ph] structure from Mali. [Indiscernible] in the North Central part of the country we were pursuing extensions to the Bongava system and as well as we've identified a number of additional high grade anomalies which are still to be tested. And in the DLC after a tough 2016, Kibali is focused really has shifted to delivering consistently every quarter on plan as it moves towards full commissioning of the underground mine in the back end of this year and lot as I pointed out in February it's integrated mine plan is still a bit lumpy, we're not sort of just as a grade of the field is really where the constraint is in. And so far we've been able to offset that by building a little more than planned and we expect to continue to do that to the end of the year but in addition, our guidance is that the cradle just step up gently through from quarter three to where we get to quarter four where it will be in the upper freeze that is driving a step increase in production. The guidance for this year being 610,000 ounces at $700 an ounce and we're comfortable of getting there because when you're looking at -- when you look at sort of the upper three [indiscernible] fee that is forecasted for quarter four, we will be around the $550 an ounce marking and if we straight line from the 830 we achieved this quarter where we should get into the $700 guidance range reasonably comfortably. These are the numbers and the bodies variable all mixed in mining constraints will as I pointed out still manifest themselves for the first off of the year but again we've got a good base to work on and we're comfortable with, the back end and I think that, that's key to overall group guidance is currently when you look at well achieve in quarter one on a run rate we're above that mid range and so any improvements on Kibali will certainly impact on our deliverables on an annual basis. So we're now seeing that Kibali will be one of the world's largest fully mechanized underground mines and the first of its kind in Africa and we expect from quarter four onwards that its automated mineral handling system or carried all the life from the underground the main of all haulage or collection haulage through the vans and always into the ground and gold room was out any further human intervention.  And these the system is going to be fully autonomous and that will run it from surface actually and the software is being developed between us and sent back. And that's the focus on that as is that, it's going to drive productivity and of course cost to efficiencies as well. Today have been even greater extent than News Kibali has pointed out has had to contend with the challenge of blending variable all tops and last quarter it had to deal with particularly difficult all makes but we'll see how it's been able to improve the current coverage and the way it manages it and the same basis through the integration of the metallurgical and mineral resource management processes. And so we see this has been able to continue to improve as the KTD more user in more metallurgical underground start to dominate the feed. In addition to managing the operational challenge as the team has been able to keep the other capital projects on track but we've commissioned the ultra-fine grind mills expansion and what's outstanding is the expansion of the leaching circuit that's the Pump cell leaching circuits which will be completed this quarter. And then we also completed the second hydro power station and commissioned this just now fully up in running as you see in that picture. And the focus is now on the Azambi third power station which is incidentally being constructed by a 100% Malian consortium. I mean really Congolese contract consortium. Has that all the operations Brownfield exploration continued with a shift in focus from name on exploration to add flexibility during what was clearly have constrained operating phase to long term reserve replacement and in this regard a broadening of the examination of the case good structure with this top lines of prospects have - have been the focus some immediate focus. Also we will continue to explore and grow are the potential we talked about last time and the after extensions of both the 3000 and 9000 certainly to date very encouraging results and the potential to deliver well in excess of a million ounces into the resource and ultimately the reserve statements. We've also stepped out and re-looked at the whole [indiscernible] where we owned a large land package and with as a result of this work and I increasing understanding of this area we've identified a number of potentially similar structures to the main case that structure that how the Kibali and those we will said, one of those is to the eastern in the joint venture tenements and the other is the case to the waste and within the [indiscernible] Belt. [Indiscernible] field, we're evaluating the final data received from the [indiscernible] Belt, and fieldwork has been scheduled to start there this month. And in the DRC as elsewhere and other of our host countries, we strive to be a valuable contributor to the community and the state. And we are involved in [indiscernible] biodiversity initiatives designed to support the survival of unique ecosystem which is particularly out in the jungle and in the Congo. And also a focus on agri business projects to guarantee food security certainly in this part of the world where recently this is desperately needed. And for the first time, we are seeing signs where that investment is starting to deliver shift in this projects which can add to the economic independence of the farmers in that area. And from the solid platform I have shown you Randgold continues to invest in the future. And nowhere is the effect of that investment more evident than in our value per share ratio or the ounces per share, and as I have said many times before, this is the only true measure of our performance in the gold mining industry and certainly value. So getting back to our theme of sustainably profitable, I think today that [indiscernible] that are difficult to copy. And this one really underpins Randgold's performance -- exposes Randgold's performance over the past 10 years highlighting that despite the ups and downs of the gold price, we've shown a sustainably profitable profile, be it profits, growth in production, and/or dividend -- dividend payment or growth over this time. And so, pulling this all together as I often do, we are one of the few major gold stock that are able to show that we definitely didn't destroy value, and trading at significant premiums to what we were trading at the start of the [indiscernible] back in 2005. And really that's the summary of our presentation. The objective really is to give you quick updates and give you an opportunity to ask some questions. So, over to you and question time, operator. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now start our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from David Haughton from CIBC. Please go ahead. David Haughton Good morning, Mark and team. Thanks for the update for us on North America. I know that you have gone through this previously in U.K. So, thank you for the patience. Just having a look at one of your slides, Mark, looking at the Gounkoto MZ4 [indiscernible], and it looks to me if that could be additional ounces within the existing super pit outline. And I presume it's not included in your reserve at this stage. Is that a reasonable way to look at it? Mark Bristow Yes. Right now as it stands, David, it's about 30 - 40,000 ounce potential, but what it's -- why it's important and that if you make it longer, I mean we can [indiscernible] down there but could become material, and we know [indiscernible] structure sometimes do surprise you on the upside, but the real driver behind this is that it affects the way we schedule the pit and more significantly we planning to improve in-pit deposit of waste. And so, we need to be smart on the scheduling. And we certainly don't want to tie up any ounces that potentially fall within the mine [indiscernible]. So, it's as much a technical -- of technical importance as well as value. David Haughton Okay. Switching to a different mine, Kibali; I have seen previously that you've got upgrade at your -- ramp up for the underground. Previous guidance was expect something like 2 million tons coming from undergone 2017, and then getting to the full run rate. Or is that 3.6 million tons in 2019, is that the kind of profit we've got ahead of us for the quarter this year? Or, does it likely lower production that we saw in the first quarter kind of making changes to those plans? Mark Bristow No, they are very much track. The big risk, David, as I pointed out in Toronto, is the Quarter 3 plan. We have built some cushions into that plan. But if you look at underground delivery, we were about 30,000 tons short in our plan for this quarter. But, we're comfortable that we'll pull that up and we're looking right now revised actual and forecast [Ph] is about 2.06 million tons from underground. David Haughton Okay. So, it's still on track for the 2017? Mark Bristow Yes. David Haughton And I haven't seen it anywhere, but what kind of grades are you getting from the underground? Is it around the reserve price or is that 4.85 kind of level? Or are you able to get a little bit better than that? Mark Bristow So if you look at underground grades for this quarter, it was around 4.7 grams. And we see -- now we have just done the scheduling. But the overall grade guidance for 2017 from underground is over 5 grams; most of it coming from Quarter 4. David Haughton Yes, okay. And that also a coincident with your best throughput as you ramp up for the course of the year too? Mark Bristow Say that again. David Haughton And that's also going to be a very big production because your throughput is going to be ramping up at that time as well be it maximum… Mark Bristow So I think that's the point. If you look at our sort of model, David, we did 141,000 ounces this quarter. And that was a 2.8 gram with a very dominant open cost feed. David Haughton Yes. Mark Bristow And then we forecasting sort of around 3 -- between 2.9 and 3.1 in this next quarter. David Haughton Yes. Mark Bristow And in the quarter -- and still was quite a big open cost component. Quarter 3, we should be up at about 3.3-ish. And then, we are still -- and then Quarter 4, we are going to the upper 3s as far as grams per ton goes, and another step up in the tonnage coming form underground. So, that drives a production profile of about 144-ish this coming quarter. And then, 155 to 159 in Quarter 3, and then, a step up from between 165 and 170 in Quarter 4. David Haughton Yes. Mark Bristow And this takes us to the 16,000 guidance. David Haughton Yes, that's quite impressive. And going into 2018, would you anticipate some of the grades coming off from the underground? Mark Bristow No, I think 2018 is we have start produce -- we have -- our 5-year plan shows the next four years at 750,000 ounces. And this is where we do -- and the grades, the grades are sort of in the [indiscernible] 3.8 to 3.95 thereabouts. So, the similar sort of grades as we get in Quarter 4; little bit higher. David Haughton Okay. So just switching from mining to finance, perhaps Graham could pick this up, so the depreciation step down, you had mentioned in May that previous quarters had included some stripping assets, just wondering what should we expect for depreciation during the course of this year? Are we going to have any of these kind of moves during the quarter year or what we're seeing in this current quarter is kind of indicative of the rest of the year? Graham Shuttleworth So David, as you mentioned, the big swing from the fourth quarter of last to this year was that stripping asset of about 16 million [indiscernible], so that is a, let's call it, a one-off, and I wouldn't say that's going to be repeated. The other big adjustment in this quarter which made it a little bit lower than the previous quarter was because we do a units of production adjustment, and so the ton mills across all of the operations was a little bit lower than it was in the fourth quarter. So obviously that depreciation will vary depending on what we do. If we ramp up then you'll see slightly higher depreciation. There was a third adjustment as well, which is also, I'll say, it's a one-off. It's something that happens once a year, and that is where we adjust the estimates for the line of mines where we've effectively -- because we're depreciating the assets over the life of mine, so where we increase our reserves, which happens on an annual basis. As you know, we put out our Federal Reserve statements at the end of March. Then we did an adjustment, and in particularly there was about a $10 million adjustment on Loulo's depreciation. So that's, let's call it, a one-off. So if you take those two out and then you compare it last year, you'll come back to a number that's more sensible. David Haughton Okay. Graham Shuttleworth Does that answer your question? David Haughton It does. And also, I know that you do it in year-end numbers where you breakout the depreciation by asset, it would be handy to see some of that more frequently actually. Graham Shuttleworth Right. Mark Bristow We already give you so much information, David. We are guiding to an increased depreciation in Quarter 4, so the run rate similar to this quarter going out to the next two quarters step up… Graham Shuttleworth [Indiscernible] goes up, and depreciation goes up. Mark Bristow Okay. To give you that guidance, if you just want a broad-brush number it's very similar next three quarters, and then about $8 million up on the final quarter. David Haughton Okay. Thank you for that. That's it from me. Mark Bristow Thank you. Operator Our next question is from Adrian Hammond from Standard Bank. Please go ahead. Adrian Hammond Hi, Mark. A couple of questions from me please. Firstly, just on the outlook for the year in terms of production, you're at 10% up year-on-year. Does that factor into any potential revisions for the rest of the year? And that's the first one. And then on second, on Tongon, what do you think the life could be extended there roughly. And are you going to apply your similar criteria, at $1000 an ounce as you do for all other projects? Mark Bristow So, Adrian, our run rate at the moment is 1.288 just on a basic arithmetic multiple, sort of four times of this quarter. As we've pointed out, you've seen me show that as improvements in deliverables of Kibali, and if so all that works out Loulo will be slightly softer, but very little going forward. Tongon is sort of 70,000 ounces to 75,000 ounces, that range over the next three quarters. So if we get Tongon through and delivered as we plan to, we're just finalizing all the details, and we'll update that the next time we speak to you. Middle of the guidance for me in Quarter 1 is still a good number. We don't build fat into our business, so to achieve the top end of the guidance would be a stellar performance for us. And more important for me is we're getting more and more comfortable about our costs, and that would be good to get. Adrian Hammond Thank you. Just on then Tongon, what are your expectations around life extension? Mark Bristow So to Tongon, again, if we had color we would tell you. We've got some of the satellites; we're busy drilling at the moment. There's potentially 100,000 ounces there that's sort of half-a-year. So I think it would be realistic from what we see today as another year on the life, which for us is critical because it gives us another year to have another look. And also, we do not apply the same focus once we've paid capital and you've got -- it's a tradeoff between mine closure and marginal value delivery. And as you know, I mean, if you look at Morila and how much value it's created, it's created more value for its shareholders and the government processing dumps than it did processing the ore body. And that's something that we're very mindful of. So as long at it's a positive cash contribution in a mine that is already scheduled to close, it's a good business. And that's where we really capitalize on delivering your 20% RR, it is that big balloon benefits at the end of the life of the mine where you've paid off your capital. Adrian Hammond Sure, thanks. And then slightly perhaps on Kibali there, underground reserves that declined -- I mean, if I read this correctly, that fell about 4.8 to 4.1 underground. What drove that? And what learning did you discover about the potential of the underground? Mark Bristow So in Randgold we always -- you hear me all the time say, even our resources have to be proved to be a potentially viable asset. And so we, in all our mines, we have proper detailed mine plans to support even our resource estimates. And Kibali, when you start a big underground mine, like Kibali, the initial modeling is very much weighted towards geostatistical block modeling, and on a cut-off basis, like the traditional old South African gold mines did. But our endeavor always is to convert those models as quickly as we can into hardwired, wire-framed ore body models, in which you then put proper mine plan schedules and tunnels, and you can actually plan the dilution, and so on. And so with all the drilling we've done -- and remember, Kibali is a bottom-up mined ore body, and so you're drilling it up. And that's what our focus is because we've got a mine that's stocking at the bottom. And so we've got to that stage where we've got a much -- and we've brought in some of our experts, and we re-logged every single borehole, put all the models, and we've got a big control -- we've learned so much more about the controls of this mineralization just by mapping the banded iron formations. And so it's a very much bigger model. It's also highlighted gaps because when you do that you lose some of the outliers where you've got a -- say, your cut-off is plus four and you've got a block of plus four, but no way to get it you lose that. What you see when you read our report is that we've already -- and if you go through the presentation, when you look at the 9,000 load and 3,000 load upside, there's already over a million ounces, 1.3-odd million ounces, that is already defined at significant grade. And again, when you do that conversion it highlights the potential. And then you go back, and you can now join up some of the sort of floating resource which doesn't get into our model anymore. And so we're more than comfortable that we'll put that back as we draw out these loads. And the exciting thing is there's more opportunities come out of this remodeling and re-logging. Adrian Hammond Great. Thanks, Mark. Mark Bristow Thank you. It's a pass. Operator Our next question is from Tanya Jakusconek from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Tanya Jakusconek Yes, hi. Good afternoon there gentlemen. Just have a question on the Domba project and thanks Mark for telling us about the production, I think it is 30,000 ounces at $700 cash cost, there is a question is that all you know you've made the decision to go ahead on is that all going to be done over what period and what capital would be required to put that through and would all of the gains from that project pretty much go back to the reclamation obligation and the community services or will there be some net money to Randgold equity? Hello. Mark Bristow Tanya, thanks for that. So well, first of all, I'll answer you the last part first, this is all about being able to bolster up the balance sheet to ensure that we deliver on this without getting back to shareholders and this is pretty well, it potentially about $10 million free cash at about $1,200 there about. Tanya Jakusconek Okay. Mark Bristow And we fund two working, it's effectively working capital you really wanted to look at our community and social program along with the relocation process around the million dollars in the whole run and some of the pre-production costs is going to be probably the same amount again. So it's and we monetize three months, we're doing the relocation now through the rainy season. So it's to start soon as it is dry enough to start digging because it's all free dig. We'll start as soon as after the 1st of September as we can to get it all into this year. Tanya Jakusconek Okay, okay that's helpful. Thank you. Operator [Operator Instructions] We have no further questions. Mr. Mark, back to you for the conclusion. Mark Bristow Thank you. Thanks everyone and as you know if anyone of you want to follow up with any more detail of questions, we're all available with teams hanging around here, Graham is on the phone, we got Joe, Simon Bottoms is standing in for [indiscernible] we got plenty of firepower to deal with any further clearings. Otherwise we'll speak to you soon. Cheerio. Operator This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Ladies and gentlemen, we will now start our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from David Haughton from CIBC. Please go ahead. David Haughton Good morning, Mark and team. Thanks for the update for us on North America. I know that you have gone through this previously in U.K. So, thank you for the patience. Just having a look at one of your slides, Mark, looking at the Gounkoto MZ4 [indiscernible], and it looks to me if that could be additional ounces within the existing super pit outline. And I presume it's not included in your reserve at this stage. Is that a reasonable way to look at it? Mark Bristow Yes. Right now as it stands, David, it's about 30 - 40,000 ounce potential, but what it's -- why it's important and that if you make it longer, I mean we can [indiscernible] down there but could become material, and we know [indiscernible] structure sometimes do surprise you on the upside, but the real driver behind this is that it affects the way we schedule the pit and more significantly we planning to improve in-pit deposit of waste. And so, we need to be smart on the scheduling. And we certainly don't want to tie up any ounces that potentially fall within the mine [indiscernible]. So, it's as much a technical -- of technical importance as well as value. David Haughton Okay. Switching to a different mine, Kibali; I have seen previously that you've got upgrade at your -- ramp up for the underground. Previous guidance was expect something like 2 million tons coming from undergone 2017, and then getting to the full run rate. Or is that 3.6 million tons in 2019, is that the kind of profit we've got ahead of us for the quarter this year?

(NASDAQ: EBAY ) Annual Shareholder Meeting Broker Conference Call  May 18, 2017, 11:00 ET Executives Thomas Tierney - Non-Executive Chairman Marie Huber - SVP, Legal Affairs, General Counsel and Secretary Tracey Ford - Former Senior Director of IR, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

I also have an affidavit from Broadridge Financial Solutions certifying that beginning on April 3, 2017, the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and, with respect only to stockholders who requested delivery of proxy materials via the mail, the proxy statement was deposited in the U.S. mail to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 20, 2017. Thomas Tierney Thank you. At this time, I'd like to introduce Trish Hudson [ph] of Broadridge Financial Services. There's Trish. Trish has been appointed to act as the Inspector of Election at this annual meeting. Trish has taken and subscribed the customary oath of office to execute her duties with strict impartiality. We will file this oath with the records of this annual meeting. As the Inspector of Election, Trish's function is to decide upon the qualification of voters, accept their votes and when, balloting on all matters is completed, to tally the final votes. Marie, please report on the existence of a quorum. Marie Huber I have been informed by the Inspector of Election that proxies have been received for 955,334,124 of the 1,079,284,521 shares of common stock outstanding on the record date of March 20, 2017 which represents approximately 88.51% of the total number of outstanding shares. I hereby declare a quorum present and this annual meeting is ready for official business as set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Thomas Tierney Thank you. And I hereby declare this annual meeting to be duly constituted for the transaction of all business. Are there any additional proxies to be submitted to the Inspector of Election at this time? All right, thank you. We will now proceed with the formal business of the annual meeting. There are 5 proposals to be considered by the stockholders at this annual meeting. Marie, please report on the opening of the polls. Tracey Ford The time is now 8:06 a.m. Pacific on May 18, 2017 and the polls are now open for voting on all matters to be presented at this annual meeting. The polls will be closed to voting after we go through the matters to be voted upon. Thomas Tierney All right. The first item of business today is the election of 12 directors to serve until our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. The 12 director nominees are Fred Anderson, Ned Barnholt, Tony Bates, Logan Green, Bonnie Hammer, Katie Mitic, Pierre Omidyar, Paul Pressler, Robert Swan, Tom Tierney, Perry Traquina and Devin Wenig. Is there any discussion? The second item of business today is the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation. Is there any discussion? The third item of business today is the advisory vote to approve the frequency with which the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation should be held. Is there any discussion? The fourth item of business today is the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent auditors of the company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. Is there any discussion? The fifth item of business today is the consideration of a stockholder proposal regarding right to act by written consent. The stockholder proposal and its supporting statement are included in the proxy statement. This proposal was submitted by one of our stockholders, John Chevedden [ph], who has authorized Ms. Connie Sepulveda [ph] to serve as his representative to present this proposal. Ms. Sepulveda, may you now -- would you now please make your statement. You have a limit of 4 minutes. Thank you. Unidentified Company Representative Proposal 5, right to act by written consent, sponsored by John Chevedden [ph] of Redondo Beach, California. Resolved shareholders request that our Board of Directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote there-on were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any topic for written consent consistent with applicable law. This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 major companies in a single year. This included 67% support at both Allstate and Sprint. Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. eBay's shareholders gave 46% support to this topic previously which means that shareholders who are informed on matters of corporate government gave this proposal topic majority support.  Taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle. A shareholder right to act by written consent and to call a special meeting are two complementary ways to bring this important matter to the attention of both management and shareholders outside the annual meeting cycle. Taking action by written consent saves us expense of holding a special shareholder meeting. Also eBay requires 25% of shareholders to aggregate their shares to call a special meeting, more than double the standard set by Delaware law. Please vote to enhance shareholder value, right to act by written consent, proposal 5. Thomas Tierney Thank you very much. The board recommends a vote against this stockholder proposal for the reasons set forth in the proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Is there any further discussion on this topic? All right. Thank you very much. That was the final proposal for this annual meeting. The Secretary will now describe the voting procedures. Marie Huber Voting is by proxy or by written ballot. Each share of common stock is entitled to 1 vote. You do not need to vote in person if you have already submitted your signed proxy or if you have submitted your signed proxy at this annual meeting. Is there anyone present, whether or not you previously submitted a proxy who now wants to vote in person? Okay. The time is now 8:12 a.m. Pacific and the polls are now closed for voting. Thomas Tierney All right. May we have the results of the voting? Marie Huber The preliminary report of the Inspector of Election covering the proposals presented at this annual meeting is as follows, the proposal to elect each of Fred Anderson, Ned Barnholt, Tony Bates, Logan Green, Bonnie Hammer, Katie Mitic, Pierre Omidyar, Paul Pressler, Bob Swan, Tom Tierney, Perry Traquina and Devin Wenig as directors of the company has been approved with each nominee receiving affirmative votes of more than 98.8% of the votes cast. The advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation has been approved with approximately 92.68% of the votes present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, being in favor of such proposal. With the affirmative vote of approximately 92.94% of the votes present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, every year received the greatest number of affirmative votes with 92.94% of the votes present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, as the frequency with which the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation should be held. The ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as independent auditors of the company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, has been approved with approximately 98.33% of the votes present, in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal, voting in favor of such ratification. The stockholder proposal regarding right to act by written consent has not been approved with 47.61% of the votes present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, being in favor of such proposal and 52.07% of the votes present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, being against such proposal. The final voting results will be published in a current report on Form 8-K that we expect to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 4 business days of this annual meeting. Thomas Tierney Thanks, Marie. The formal business portion of the annual meeting is now concluded. At this time, Devin will make some remarks regarding the company's business. These remarks may include some forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed. More information about potential factors that could affect the company's business and financial results is included in the company's SEC filings, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K and its quarterly results on Form 10-Q. Following his remarks, Devin will be happy to answer questions from stockholders. The annual meeting is now adjourned. Thank you all very much. Devin? Devin Wenig Good morning. I'd like to welcome you to our new facility. This is the first year we're doing it in this building, so we're really pleased to have you here. I'm going to do some brief remarks and then very happy to take any of your questions with -- along with the management team who are here. I think this is the written version of what Tom just said, but this is our safe-harbor warning. So I may talk about forward-looking things in here. Please don't rely on them and please read this.  We wrote a letter to our shareholders. I write that myself. We take it very seriously and I try to lay out a little bit about the philosophy that the management team approaches running this business. And as you are aware, this is a technology company. We're a company that is -- competes in a very dynamic and competitive space. This is a wonderful principle, purpose-driven company, but we run the company according to principles that allow us to be purpose-driven while reinventing and constantly competing. So we've been in leadership positions for roughly 18 months, approaching 2 years and these principles haven't changed. We understand that while we have a successful business, if we don't reinvent it, it won't always be successful. We've got to continually reinvent what we do. We're builders at heart. We love to build products. We love to build great customer experiences. We get up in the morning and what we want to do is do better for our sellers, do better for the consumers who rely on eBay every day. We run the company for the long term. It's easy to say that, it's hard to do it. But we compete in an industry where there are companies that are making bets that last a decade or longer. We have to deliver in the short run, but we have to improve the customer experience and run the company so that eBay will be successful and thrive for the next decade and beyond. And many of the investments that we've made over the last 18 months to 2 years are really about that, they're about improving the underlying competitive position of our business. They're about building a sustainable competitive moat, because we deliver a better customer experience for both our sellers and our buyers.  And finally, this is truly a purpose-driven company. We care about delivering connected commerce. We care about the entrepreneurs, the merchants, the sellers that rely on eBay for their business, for their livelihood. It's in the water here. It's really important to us. We talk about it all the time and that drives a lot of what we do.  These are really simple set of strategic priorities, that every single thing we do in any of our locations around the world ladder up to one of these three things.  People come to eBay to buy things. That's why we need the best choice, that means the right product at the right price. That means having great inventory selection, that means understanding that inventory and that means bringing people unique choice wherever we can. Relevance means, for consumers, a simple experience, a non-overwhelming experience, a targeted experience. It means they find what they're looking for quickly and easily. And finally, the most powerful selling platform means that, whether you're a consumer or a business seller, eBay is simple, it's profitable and it's very easy to sell what you want and get the best price in the world. These are simple principles, but they are hundreds of projects that layer up to these three things. 2016 was a year of progress. Our company is growing again. We saw revenue growth at 7% to $9 billion, this is fiscal year 2016. GMV growth of 5% at $84 billion. Active buyers grew 3% to 167 million; and as we've said repeatedly, this is a company blessed with strong free cash flow. We have a capital allocation priority. Part of that is returning excess capital to shareholders and we did return $3 billion of capital through the form of share buybacks last year. So overall, 2016 was a strong year where we saw accelerating progress. Importantly, because we're running the company for the long run, while we certainly measure the year's financial results, we also look at the important operational metrics to see if, not only 2016 was strong, but are we making progress on the way to building sustainable differentiation for this company for the long term. And I do believe that we're on that path.  Just another view of 2016, eBay's revenue was 4% -- keep in mind there were some FX effects on this which is oftentimes the difference between a reported number and the spot number. 5% GMV, you saw. StubHub had a very strong year at 30% revenue growth, 21% GMV growth. And Classifieds which doesn't report GMV but reports revenue, saw growth at 15%. So overall, we saw accelerating progress for all 3 of our platforms and that's why we believe it was a year of progress. Moving forward, we've talked about the critical investments we're making and we're really excited about. This -- we talk about 2016 because it's a full fiscal year, but we're obviously well into 2017, we're halfway through, it feels like. And this is another year where we feel like we're making progress. The first quarter was certainly a quarter of progress for us. The things we're doing are really now starting to show up for our customers. Important things like our foundation of structured data is allowing us to build better selling experiences. It's allowing us to simplify our selling flows. It's allowing us to get better insight to our sellers, so they understand how to price their inventory better and get better velocity. For our consumers, this is a period of very rapid change of the eBay experience. Because we made foundational investments, we're able to do things now we haven't been able to do in our 20-year history. And you'll see the eBay experience for consumers simplify, you'll see it differentiate and you'll see our brand really start to come through in the second half of this year. I'm very, very excited that we're right on the cusp now of some very significant product changes. Coupled with that, we also are paying more attention now to our corporate brand than we probably have in our history. We know the eBay brand is ubiquitous, we also know, oftentimes, the eBay brand is misunderstood. I think that everybody in the world knows eBay, but many people think eBay is still a place where I can only participate in an auction or eBay is only a place where I can buy something that is secondhand or used. Obviously, neither of those is true. And we think the world's consumers should rely on eBay, because there's extraordinary selection, both new and preowned and you can buy it in any format that you'd like. So I think we have to tell our story with a little bit more purpose.  And we've begun that journey. You maybe have seen us experimenting with some outdoor advertising and some television and certainly on social and even radio, but that is just the beginning and actually we're just weeks away from a fairly significant step-up in our brand efforts. So it's very exciting to be on the cusp of both significant product changes for our sellers and our buyers and a significant brand campaign. And this is what we've been saying consistently for 18 months. We're going to make hard investments, we're going to change the foundation of the company, we're going to change the eBay experience and then we're going to be proud to tell our story and those are all things that we're doing. What happens beyond that? I'm not going to say a long -- I'm not going to give a long speech about this. All I'm going to say is that I look at our company through the lens of understanding big technology changes and making them work for commerce. eBay was the first company that really made commerce work on the Internet. eBay was the first company to really make commerce work on smart mobile devices. And eBay is going to be the first company to make commerce work in these three significant emerging computing platform trends which we believe is the future.  AI is a very important factor in the world. We're making significant investments in it to allow our sellers to sell more intelligently, our buyers to be targeted more intelligently. The Internet of Everywhere means eBay can't just be a website or a mobile app. It actually has to be where people are spending their digital lives which means social or messaging applications or a trillion connected streams that are coming. And VR and AR, we think, is really interesting. It's not a toy; it's another platform. And particularly for really interesting, unique, sometimes high-priced things that are sold on eBay, we think an immersive experience can be really, really interesting. We started experimenting with that in platforms like StubHub and consumers love it. They actually like an immersive experience when we can give it to them.  So these things seem a little early and maybe they seem a little bit down the road, but one of the things we've learned at this company is it's a lot better to be early than it is to be late and these are going to be important and they'll go from being on the horizon to on top of us very, very quickly, so we're making our bets now to position the company for the future. What can you expect this year? Some of this I've already said, so I'll be brief. This will be a year of rapid product innovation and evolution. You'll see the user experience, whether you're a buyer or a seller or both, rapidly improve. We're really in that role right now. If you're on eBay frequently, you are experiencing those changes. You'll see more brands on our platform, you'll see more inventory, you'll see more sellers. We're growing our professional seller base quite nicely. You'll see a sharpened and enhanced eBay brand that we're proud of and we market. You will certainly feel the eBay brand out in the world starting in about 3 weeks and significant investments in consumer trust. We've already announced programs like authentication which we think will be very interesting, particularly for consumer-sold goods in higher-priced categories, where having an extra layer of trust, we think some consumers would appreciate that. So this is a year where we're making a lot of investments and we're expecting a lot of output for our customers. It's been an exciting 2016, an exciting first quarter, but I think the best is yet to come and we're just really beginning this march of building the world's greatest commerce company and setting ourselves up for the next decade of innovation and competitiveness. So we certainly appreciate your support. And with that, I'm happy to take any questions that you may have. Any questions? Is that you itching your head, Brian? Or -- you're a shareholder. You're allowed to asked a question. I'm really disappointed. Okay. I don't want to cut the conversation short. Going once, going twice. Okay. I'll stick around for a few minutes, so if you didn't want to ask in a public forum, I'm happy to answer any questions privately, but enjoy the refreshments and we really appreciate your support.

Wittine - Longbow Research LLC Edward Parker - BTIG LLC Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC Operator Good morning. And welcome to the Seagate Technology Fiscal Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Liz and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participate are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. At this time, I would like to turn the call over it to Kate Scolnick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Please proceed, Kate. Kate Scolnick - Seagate Technology Plc Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO; Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO; Dave Mosley, President and COO; and Phil Brace, President of Cloud Systems and Silicon Group. We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information for our March quarter of fiscal 2017 on our Investor Relations site at Seagate.com. For the last few years, we have communicated our belief that data growths trends will continue to drive storage exabyte demand and the related measurement of capacity per drive and that units are less relevant to mobile cloud environments and future client addressable markets. In today's newly deployed architectures and applications, high-capacity mass storage is critical. Importantly for Seagate, it is the advanced technology and heads of media, as well as manufacturing absorption of these technologies and test capacity absorption that will most significantly impact our financial performance. Going forward, we will continue orienting our conference call remarks and supplemental data to key market exabyte results and other business metrics and discontinue providing unit detail. We recognize this represents a change for the investment community in the short term, but believe it better reflects how we are managing and measuring our business performance internally and will help our industry to be evaluated more effectively in a forward-looking manner. During today's call, we will review the highlights for the March quarter and provide the company outlook for the June quarter and then open the call for questions. We are planning for the call today to go approximately half an hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks, as time permits. We will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures on this call. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investor section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance, customer demand, technology and product development advancements and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. Information concerning our risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in the company's SEC filings and supplemental information posted on the Investor section of the company's website. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Luczo. Please go ahead, Steve. Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business. Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the June quarter as well as an update for the calendar year. For the March quarter, Seagate achieved: revenues of approximately $2.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 30.5%; net income of $194 million; and diluted earnings per share of $0.65. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved: gross margins of 31.4%, up 870 basis points year-over-year; net income of $329 million; and diluted earnings per share of $1.10. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $426 million, up 108% year-over-year. Our March quarter results reflect a relatively stable demand environment and improved profitability year-over-year. HDD exabyte shipments for the March quarter were 65.5 exabytes, up approximately 18% year-over-year. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was approximately 1.8 terabytes per drive, up 27% year-over-year. ASPs of $67 were sequentially flat for the March quarter and up 10% year-over-year. Our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group demonstrated 19% year-over-year growth in the March quarter, with particular strength in our flash-based solutions. We are pleased with Seagate's execution in the March quarter, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our storage technology portfolio and our continued execution on operational efficiencies. I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on our operational activities. David H. Morton, Jr. - Seagate Technology Plc Thanks, Steve. For the March quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was relatively in line with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product sales towards our higher capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results year-over-year. HDD enterprise revenues were up 3% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 20% year-over-year and representing 36% of our total consolidated revenue. Within this, nearline revenues were up 9% year-over-year and represented 24% of our total consolidated revenue. Hyperscale nearline revenues were up strong double digits, and our 8 terabyte nearline product continues to be our leading revenue SKU. Our HDD client high-capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DDR and NAS markets. Revenues from these markets were up 25% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 41% year-over-year and representing approximately 28% of the total consolidated revenue. Average capacity per drive across these markets was over 2 terabyte per drive, up 22% year-over-year. In our mature mission critical and PC client markets, revenues declined year-over-year, as expected, and exabytes declined slightly. PC client revenues continue to represent approximately 25% of the total consolidated revenue. Operating expenses for the March quarter were $550 million on a GAAP basis and $443 million on a non-GAAP basis. Total consolidated expenses were slightly higher than forecast, primarily due to non-executive variable compensation. Capital expenditures were $95 million for the March quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment supporting the continued ramp of new HDD products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at, or very near, full capacity. Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $426 million and free cash flow was $331 million. These results include approximately $150 million in cash payments related to restructuring charges and biannual non-executive variable compensation. Excluding these items, cash flow from operations would have been approximately $576 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the March quarter in $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 297 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the March quarter, which will be payable on July 5. In January, we successfully completed a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment-grade financing with a weighted average interest rate of less than 5%. This funding will serve as a pre-financing of our 2018 and our 2021 notes and other corporate purposes. We have called our 2021 7% senior notes with a payment of $158 million scheduled for May 1. Interest expense for the March quarter was $60 million and will be similar in the June quarter. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment-grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest rate. Our March quarter results continue to reflect strong execution of our business model objectives and our ability to generate strong cash flow from our Storage portfolio. Combined with our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, we view that approximately 80% of our Storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 and beyond have growth potential. While we are still in the process of executing a number of our cost actions in our manufacturing sites and at the corporate level, we believe the combination of these cost alignment activities and the competitiveness of our HDD product portfolio will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of calendar year 2017 and beyond. I would now like to turn the call back to Steve. Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Thanks, Dave. A few weeks ago, we launched our Data Age 2025 study with IDC that addresses data growth, location and new business verticals over the next several years. With a forecast of 163 zettabytes of information being created over the next few years, HDD mass storage technology will continue to be a vital player in maximizing the value of data across many new verticals. We believe continuing to optimize our full HDD product portfolio to the structural shifts in application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. By this time next year, we anticipate less than 10% of our HDD technology portfolio will be exposed to competing flash devices. The competitiveness of our HDD portfolio is a result of our long-term investment in delivering world-class storage technology and our dedication to product innovation. A few recent portfolio highlights include: in the nearline market, our 10 terabyte Helium HDD is continuing to ramp with large hyperscale cloud service provider customers. Customer evaluation feedback on our 12 terabyte Helium HDDs has been positive, and we plan to start volume shipments in the June quarter. We believe our opportunities in the nearline market will continue to span across multiple capacity points as our customers evolve their capacity infrastructure for a growing multiple of enterprise workload applications. We are successfully refreshing a number of products in our portfolio, utilizing our fourth generation SMR technology. And to-date, we have sold over 35 million HDDs into the nearline client and consumer markets with this technology. We believe our technical leadership in areal density will continue through calendar 2017. Our planned 1 terabyte and 2 terabyte product refreshes for the PC compute markets are on schedule. And this week at NAB, we announced new consumer products including our first offering for the drone marketplace, the Fly Drive, which includes enough space for 60 hours of 4K video footage and developed in partnership with top drone manufacturer, DJI. From an R&D technology perspective, we continue to invest in our next-generation areal density HAMR technology. With products on the road map for the late 2018 calendar year, we believe we are leading the market in developing and bringing to market this important cost-benefit solution for mass storage capacity needs. Turning to the market outlook, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. For the June quarter, we are expecting to achieve revenues of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. Our expectations reflect a seasonal decline in revenue, our desire to maintain lower inventories going into the summer months and some conservatism due to the potential impact of component shortages in DRAM and NAND on various aspects of our customers' businesses in the server, CSP and client space. We are raising our gross margin expectations for the June quarter to 31%, and we are targeting a new range for calendar 2017 of 29% to 33%. As Dave indicated, operating expenses will trend sequentially down to expect approximately $430 million in the June quarter. We anticipate operating expenses will continue to decline through the rest of the calendar year and exit the December quarter at or below $400 million. Cash flow from operations will be down slightly sequentially, reflecting lower seasonal revenue and cash payout related to our elimination of U.S. vacation accrual. We continue to expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016, representing modest revenue growth opportunities for Seagate. Assuming market conditions remain intact, we continue to believe Seagate will achieve earnings per share of at least $4.50 in calendar 2017, and we will provide a fiscal 2018 outlook on our July call. Thank you for joining us on the call today. And we'll now open the call up for questions and answers. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Our first question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC Hi. Thanks. Maybe discuss your go-forward exabyte growth expectations by the segments as you lay them out. And specifically... Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc We're not going to provide exabyte growth by segments. That's highly competitive information. Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC Okay. Maybe I should ask... Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc We still believe in exabyte growth that's consistent with what we've said over the last couple of years. Exabyte growth in excess of areal density growth. Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC Can nearline still grow in the mid to high-30%s this year after the 20% start? I ask because the remaining quarters have some pretty difficult comps. So maybe talk a little bit more detail with that. Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Yes, I do think they can. As you see the 10s and 12s start to ramp. I think the first half of the year has been an issue both of what's really the right marketplace for the 10 terabyte, especially with the 12 kind of coming right behind it, as well as the CSPs have been – and we've kind of expected this the whole time, that the second half of the year was going to be stronger than the first half of the year. So I think the combination of stronger demand signals for the second half plus the rotation of the portfolio that's going to have 8s, 10s and 12s and not just pretty much 8s, you're going to see exabyte growth there that's going to continue. Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC Okay. And then as a follow-up, price per exabyte declined at the lowest rate in a few years. It's now the second quarter you're kind of in a 13% to 14% range versus the low 20%s range that the industry has been in. What is a good expectation to model going forward, given you said you're generally near peak capacity? Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Yes. I think that's a great question. I think we've got to continue to be very careful on the pricing, especially, again, as you go from 10s and 12s. On the one hand, the customer demand is certainly there for those higher capacity drives, but the industry's capability to deliver that technology is coming through solutions that effectively cost more. Either you're adding more heads in disk or other technology to handle that kind of workload. And especially when you're adding more heads in disk, you have to obviously be very careful about the aggressive price takedowns that have occurred because somehow you have to absorb the extra parts. So I think you're going to see some resolution where those price declines are going to continue to stabilize just because we have to afford the new technology. And, of course, we're not going to end at 10s or 12s. We're going to have to get to 16 and then 20 and 32, and that's all going to take a lot of technology. So we definitely believe you're going to see stabilization in that pricing. Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC Okay. Thanks, Steve. Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Yes. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Edward Parker with BTIG. Edward Parker - BTIG LLC Thanks. Steve, I wanted to ask you about price elasticity and I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the impact of higher NAND pricing in the quarter on your HDD business. Are you seeing higher unit sales because of higher prices for SSDs or higher unit sales because of the lack of availability for SSDs? And then secondly, how do you think about price elasticity across your portfolio? And how could that change as you look at your business over the next couple of years? Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Well, I think the NAND shortages are interesting because, at the end of the day, I think it's more challenging for the technology industry to deal with the shortages than it is maybe beneficial to HDDs because of some comparison on a 500 gig. I mean, the reality is even a 500-gig NAND drive, at today's prices or even at six months ago prices, aren't remotely competitive to an HDD price. I do think that the lack of availability of NAND in certain market segments results in people then shifting their strategies around do they use HDDs or not. So I think, for example, the NAND companies are constantly optimizing where do they shift their NAND. Does to go into phones? Does it go into the data centers? Does it go into the servers or does it go into the PCs? And depending on the grade of flash you're building, the capacity plans you put in six months ago and then what customers are asking for, there's this constant re-optimization of where the NAND is flowing. I think in the short term probably, and I think HP indicated this on their call two quarters ago, that they felt that the PC industry was being constrained a bit on NAND. I think that probably has shifted some longer-term strategy around product portfolios that breathes some more life into the HDD space, in that people don't want to be caught short with storage technology of any type. And, of course, there again we're talking about 128 or 256. For us, it's really an issue of getting the volumes ramped on the 1TB, where we have a substantial lead, and then offering that product to the PC companies that maybe today are taking a lot of 500- gig product because at volume, obviously, it's a single-disk and two-headed product, so we can be quite competitive. So I think from a Seagate perspective, we feel that the shortage overall might marginally help us on the client space as we move through the calendar year and maybe even to the beginning of next year. I think where it's more problematic for the industry in general, and I mean everyone, is if it's constraining build-outs at all at the CSP space, that with the DRAM shortages. And we have seen indications of certain deployments being delayed because they basically can't get all the component technology that they need across the board. We experience that a little bit in our own CSSG business, where we obviously need to get flash to sell our flash drives. We have a big demand profile for our current-generation products, which are quite competitive. But we're constrained by as much as $40 million or $50 million in revenue in terms of can we get the flash or not. So that's one of the issues that we're going to be working hard and one of the reasons that I think there is some opportunity on the revenue side if we can secure that NAND. So it's a pretty dynamic situation that you're on top of. I don't know that it's as easy to say that it's good or bad. I think there's some good to it and there's some pressures from it. We've always said it's a better world if there's a lot of NAND because that means people have more devices in their hand and they're creating more data. And that's still our thesis. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC Thank you. Good morning. Steve, can you just elaborate a little more about your comment that less than 10% of your portfolio would be exposed to competing flash devices? Like over what timeframe are you referring and how do you get there? Is that walking away from categories, or is that just a mix change towards more cloud service providers? Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Well, I'll let Mosley go into more details, but we've already walked away from those markets. Basically, again, we don't participate in the 500 gigabyte market really today. Ad that's because we have a technology lead and we want to leverage that. And, of course, the recent price increases from the NAND folks have made a 500 gigabyte drive unattainable, for sure. Even the 256s, I think we've heard price talks in the $60 or $70 range, which is pretty amazing. So I think it's a more longer-term trend, and I'll have Dave talk to it, but it doesn't really talk to the CSPs. The CSPs are enabled by all tiers of storage. William David Mosley, Ph.D. - Seagate Technology Plc Yeah, Rich. This is Dave. I would go back to Ed's question as well to dovetail on to that. So we have to model what the NAND pricing is going to be out in time. And then we model where Seagate wants to be selling product; is it 500 gigabytes, 1 terabyte, 2 terabyte and so on. And we look at those price banding for our various market segments and we make those estimates. So we what we said is, over the next year, it'll develop such that less than 10% of our portfolio is exposed. I think by this time next year, it will be far less than 10%. And we're working hard to make sure that happens, make sure we move up in capacity points. Of course, some of that's what the customers want and some of that is dictated by where exactly the NAND pricing is. But that's how we run the model. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC Great. And then just lastly as a follow-up, the Systems business you said a good quarter on the flash side, but embedded in there is also the systems that are going to some enterprise players, like HP, for the mid-range MSA stuff. So in light of the Nimble acquisition, just how should he with think about the Storage Systems business? Philip G. Brace - Seagate Technology Plc Yeah, Rich. This is Phil. The Storage Systems business certainly in the current quarter had a good performance as well, year-over-year growth. And we expect to see year-over-year growth going forward. Customer activity in that space continues to be really high, particularly in the OEM space. What we see is that as OEMs look to be figure out where they spend their R&D dollars, they certainly are making opportunities available for Seagate for us to come in and work with them on higher levels of integration. And that's particularly true as we start to have higher levels of integration between, I'll say, our component-related products, like SSDs and HDs, and our system-level products. So, overall, that business continues to grow nicely. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC Okay. Great. Thank you. Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc We have time for one more question I think. Operator Our last question comes from the line of Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners. Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC Hi. Thank you very much. I guess I wanted to follow up on Rich's question on the Systems business. If you go back, you guys have made a couple of acquisitions both in Systems and with LSI on the flash side. And yet it's still well under 10% of revenue. I was just wondering from a strategic standpoint, as Systems are moving higher up the enterprise stack, is that strategically a big part of what you guys are looking to do do you think over the next few years, or is that kind of taking a back seat? Thank you. Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Yeah, I don't think it's really changed much in terms of our original intention. We've always felt there's an opportunity in the Systems business in the higher value-add categories because our Systems business, at least a good hunk of it, has a fair amount of software competency to it as well. And so we serve OEMs in that space. And more and more so, we're getting traction with the cloud service providers that are looking at solutions beyond the device level. So I think, from our perspective, we've always viewed this business as attractive in terms of its core business of selling into OEMs as well as servicing cloud service providers at one level. But really the opportunity to, as architectures evolve and different customer needs evolve, to have the capability to optimize the devices, either at the device level, the sub-system level or the systems level. And if you don't have the software capability to do that, you really can't take advantage of what we think will be a potentially significant long-term trend. I think the issue is, one, is that how does that evolve, over what period of time and what does it cost you in the mean time? And so I think, for us, we continue to work the financial model so the Systems business is profitable to the overall business and then gives us the option to grow into some of these markets if we see either OEMs or CSPs decide that they want to see solutions at the systems level versus the device level. And we still believe that's the opportunity in front of us. I would say, if anything, over the last six to 12 months we've seen and had dialogues with customers that have us more encouraged about that opportunity versus less encouraged. So we are as committed as we have been to growing that business to what we with think will be a meaningful business in the overall portfolio. Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC Makes sense. Thank you. Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Okay. Great. All right. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate the time you've taken this morning. And I want to again thank our employees, our customers, our suppliers and our shareholders. And we look forward to speaking with you again in July. Thank you.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Our first question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC Hi. Thanks. Maybe discuss your go-forward exabyte growth expectations by the segments as you lay them out. And specifically... Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc We're not going to provide exabyte growth by segments. That's highly competitive information. Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC Okay. Maybe I should ask... Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc We still believe in exabyte growth that's consistent with what we've said over the last couple of years. Exabyte growth in excess of areal density growth. Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC Can nearline still grow in the mid to high-30%s this year after the 20% start? I ask because the remaining quarters have some pretty difficult comps. So maybe talk a little bit more detail with that. Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Yes, I do think they can. As you see the 10s and 12s start to ramp. I think the first half of the year has been an issue both of what's really the right marketplace for the 10 terabyte, especially with the 12 kind of coming right behind it, as well as the CSPs have been – and we've kind of expected this the whole time, that the second half of the year was going to be stronger than the first half of the year. So I think the combination of stronger demand signals for the second half plus the rotation of the portfolio that's going to have 8s, 10s and 12s and not just pretty much 8s, you're going to see exabyte growth there that's going to continue. Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC Okay. And then as a follow-up, price per exabyte declined at the lowest rate in a few years. It's now the second quarter you're kind of in a 13% to 14% range versus the low 20%s range that the industry has been in. What is a good expectation to model going forward, given you said you're generally near peak capacity? Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Yes. I think that's a great question. I think we've got to continue to be very careful on the pricing, especially, again, as you go from 10s and 12s. On the one hand, the customer demand is certainly there for those higher capacity drives, but the industry's capability to deliver that technology is coming through solutions that effectively cost more. Either you're adding more heads in disk or other technology to handle that kind of workload. And especially when you're adding more heads in disk, you have to obviously be very careful about the aggressive price takedowns that have occurred because somehow you have to absorb the extra parts. So I think you're going to see some resolution where those price declines are going to continue to stabilize just because we have to afford the new technology. And, of course, we're not going to end at 10s or 12s. We're going to have to get to 16 and then 20 and 32, and that's all going to take a lot of technology. So we definitely believe you're going to see stabilization in that pricing. Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC Okay. Thanks, Steve. Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Yes. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Edward Parker with BTIG. Edward Parker - BTIG LLC Thanks. Steve, I wanted to ask you about price elasticity and I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the impact of higher NAND pricing in the quarter on your HDD business. Are you seeing higher unit sales because of higher prices for SSDs or higher unit sales because of the lack of availability for SSDs? And then secondly, how do you think about price elasticity across your portfolio? And how could that change as you look at your business over the next couple of years? Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Well, I think the NAND shortages are interesting because, at the end of the day, I think it's more challenging for the technology industry to deal with the shortages than it is maybe beneficial to HDDs because of some comparison on a 500 gig. I mean, the reality is even a 500-gig NAND drive, at today's prices or even at six months ago prices, aren't remotely competitive to an HDD price. I do think that the lack of availability of NAND in certain market segments results in people then shifting their strategies around do they use HDDs or not. So I think, for example, the NAND companies are constantly optimizing where do they shift their NAND. Does to go into phones? Does it go into the data centers? Does it go into the servers or does it go into the PCs? And depending on the grade of flash you're building, the capacity plans you put in six months ago and then what customers are asking for, there's this constant re-optimization of where the NAND is flowing. I think in the short term probably, and I think HP indicated this on their call two quarters ago, that they felt that the PC industry was being constrained a bit on NAND. I think that probably has shifted some longer-term strategy around product portfolios that breathes some more life into the HDD space, in that people don't want to be caught short with storage technology of any type. And, of course, there again we're talking about 128 or 256. For us, it's really an issue of getting the volumes ramped on the 1TB, where we have a substantial lead, and then offering that product to the PC companies that maybe today are taking a lot of 500- gig product because at volume, obviously, it's a single-disk and two-headed product, so we can be quite competitive. So I think from a Seagate perspective, we feel that the shortage overall might marginally help us on the client space as we move through the calendar year and maybe even to the beginning of next year. I think where it's more problematic for the industry in general, and I mean everyone, is if it's constraining build-outs at all at the CSP space, that with the DRAM shortages. And we have seen indications of certain deployments being delayed because they basically can't get all the component technology that they need across the board. We experience that a little bit in our own CSSG business, where we obviously need to get flash to sell our flash drives. We have a big demand profile for our current-generation products, which are quite competitive. But we're constrained by as much as $40 million or $50 million in revenue in terms of can we get the flash or not. So that's one of the issues that we're going to be working hard and one of the reasons that I think there is some opportunity on the revenue side if we can secure that NAND. So it's a pretty dynamic situation that you're on top of. I don't know that it's as easy to say that it's good or bad. I think there's some good to it and there's some pressures from it. We've always said it's a better world if there's a lot of NAND because that means people have more devices in their hand and they're creating more data. And that's still our thesis. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC Thank you. Good morning. Steve, can you just elaborate a little more about your comment that less than 10% of your portfolio would be exposed to competing flash devices? Like over what timeframe are you referring and how do you get there? Is that walking away from categories, or is that just a mix change towards more cloud service providers? Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Well, I'll let Mosley go into more details, but we've already walked away from those markets. Basically, again, we don't participate in the 500 gigabyte market really today. Ad that's because we have a technology lead and we want to leverage that. And, of course, the recent price increases from the NAND folks have made a 500 gigabyte drive unattainable, for sure. Even the 256s, I think we've heard price talks in the $60 or $70 range, which is pretty amazing. So I think it's a more longer-term trend, and I'll have Dave talk to it, but it doesn't really talk to the CSPs. The CSPs are enabled by all tiers of storage. William David Mosley, Ph.D. - Seagate Technology Plc Yeah, Rich. This is Dave. I would go back to Ed's question as well to dovetail on to that. So we have to model what the NAND pricing is going to be out in time. And then we model where Seagate wants to be selling product; is it 500 gigabytes, 1 terabyte, 2 terabyte and so on. And we look at those price banding for our various market segments and we make those estimates. So we what we said is, over the next year, it'll develop such that less than 10% of our portfolio is exposed. I think by this time next year, it will be far less than 10%. And we're working hard to make sure that happens, make sure we move up in capacity points. Of course, some of that's what the customers want and some of that is dictated by where exactly the NAND pricing is. But that's how we run the model. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC Great. And then just lastly as a follow-up, the Systems business you said a good quarter on the flash side, but embedded in there is also the systems that are going to some enterprise players, like HP, for the mid-range MSA stuff. So in light of the Nimble acquisition, just how should he with think about the Storage Systems business? Philip G. Brace - Seagate Technology Plc Yeah, Rich. This is Phil. The Storage Systems business certainly in the current quarter had a good performance as well, year-over-year growth. And we expect to see year-over-year growth going forward. Customer activity in that space continues to be really high, particularly in the OEM space. What we see is that as OEMs look to be figure out where they spend their R&D dollars, they certainly are making opportunities available for Seagate for us to come in and work with them on higher levels of integration. And that's particularly true as we start to have higher levels of integration between, I'll say, our component-related products, like SSDs and HDs, and our system-level products. So, overall, that business continues to grow nicely. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC Okay. Great. Thank you. Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc We have time for one more question I think. Operator Our last question comes from the line of Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners. Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC Hi. Thank you very much. I guess I wanted to follow up on Rich's question on the Systems business. If you go back, you guys have made a couple of acquisitions both in Systems and with LSI on the flash side. And yet it's still well under 10% of revenue. I was just wondering from a strategic standpoint, as Systems are moving higher up the enterprise stack, is that strategically a big part of what you guys are looking to do do you think over the next few years, or is that kind of taking a back seat? Thank you. Stephen James Luczo - Seagate Technology Plc Yeah, I don't think it's really changed much in terms of our original intention. We've always felt there's an opportunity in the Systems business in the higher value-add categories because our Systems business, at least a good hunk of it, has a fair amount of software competency to it as well. And so we serve OEMs in that space. And more and more so, we're getting traction with the cloud service providers that are looking at solutions beyond the device level. So I think, from our perspective, we've always viewed this business as attractive in terms of its core business of selling into OEMs as well as servicing cloud service providers at one level. But really the opportunity to, as architectures evolve and different customer needs evolve, to have the capability to optimize the devices, either at the device level, the sub-system level or the systems level. And if you don't have the software capability to do that, you really can't take advantage of what we think will be a potentially significant long-term trend. I think the issue is, one, is that how does that evolve, over what period of time and what does it cost you in the mean time? And so I think, for us, we continue to work the financial model so the Systems business is profitable to the overall business and then gives us the option to grow into some of these markets if we see either OEMs or CSPs decide that they want to see solutions at the systems level versus the device level. And we still believe that's the opportunity in front of us. I would say, if anything, over the last six to 12 months we've seen and had dialogues with customers that have us more encouraged about that opportunity versus less encouraged. So we are as committed as we have been to growing that business to what we with think will be a meaningful business in the overall portfolio. Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC Makes sense.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We're off to a strong start to the year with financial results for the quarter slightly ahead of our internal expectations and sales results well ahead of the prior year. Importantly, we're on track to achieve our 2017 financial outlook. Internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter and adjusted operating income was up 8%. Adjusted operating margin expanded by 60 basis points and adjusted earnings per share was up a very strong 18%. Free cash flow per share was stellar, increasing 27%, and that excludes a $31 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture received during the quarter. We were honored to be named one of the Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies for our fourth consecutive year, a recognition that we share with our clients, associates and shareholders. We were especially proud to be ranked number one for innovation in our category for the second year in a row. At the beginning of the year, we shared our 2017 key priorities to help you gauge our progress. The first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments. Second, enhance client relationships, with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. And third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. Our focus on building high-quality revenue translated to 4% internal revenue growth in the quarter, with strong performance in businesses, such as card services, lending solutions and output solutions. Growth in scale businesses, along with continued progress with our operational effectiveness programs combined to deliver 60 basis points of operating margin expansion and 8% growth in adjusted operating income. You may have seen that we attained a new level of Payment segment margin that we believe is representative of the strength of those businesses moving forward. At the same time, we continue to operate to deliver the right balance between investment, consistent margin expansion and strong free cash flow. As I said, we're pleased with our results in the quarter and are well-positioned to deliver on our financial commitments for the full year. Our second priority is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. We welcomed Whatcom Educational Credit Union to the Fiserv family in the quarter. This institution, with assets of $1.4 billion, was in the market to upgrade both their core account processing and digital channels technologies in response to the evolving market landscape. In a competitive process, they selected our DNA platform due to its flexibility and modern technology. They also chose Architect, our market-leading digital solution, along with a number of other integrated surrounds, all geared at enabling an exceptional member experience. We signed a total of five DNA clients in the quarter, including four with assets greater than $1 billion. During the quarter, we also passed the century mark in DNA signings since our acquisition of Open Solutions in 2013. Interest remains high as the market continues to embrace this modern technology platform, combined with the power of Fiserv surround solutions. We expect to see even more over the next several years as we further advance the solution through differentiated product enhancements and integration with our recently acquired market-leading commercial capabilities. You may recall that we mentioned our Notifi alerting solution in Q4. Notifi enables financial institutions to interact with their customers in a personalized way based on transactional data. We signed over 50 institutions in 2016 to our 1.0 solution and added 20 more in the first quarter. We're excited about this capability and optimistic about the value-add data opportunities that should become available over time. Digital experience continues to rise in importance for both financial institutions and the customers they serve. Along those lines, Mobiliti ASP continues to grow, increasing nearly 30% over the prior year's quarter and 6% sequentially to 5.8 million subscribers. Our Mobiliti business solution is also taking hold, with sales increasing more than 60% over the prior year. Institutions remain in the early stages of unlocking the power of digital and are looking for additional ways to enable value for their retail and commercial customers. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. Last quarter, we told you about our recent acquisition of Online Banking Solutions, or OBS, and its sophisticated digital commercial banking product, now called Commercial Center. OBS is an example of acquired innovation, which when coupled with our other leading solutions, positions us to deliver accelerated client value and additional revenue growth. We're encouraged by the interest that OBS has sparked, especially in larger commercially focused institutions. We mentioned Architect, our integrated online and mobile banking solution for both retail and business customers earlier as part of the Whatcom Educational Credit Union win. Architect was acquired about a year ago and we signed 14 clients to-date. We also have a growing pipeline of 70 institutions who are exploring this innovative digital solution. We continue to rank digital experience as one of the most critical areas of focus for all financial institutions domestically and around the world. Last quarter we shared our enthusiasm with you for BillMatrix Next, our biller-based digital payments platform, which allows us to efficiently process any number of payment types. This solution has rapidly opened up the broader bill payment market on both a standalone basis and across our account processing clients, enabling enhanced multi-channel billing and payment capabilities. We're in the early days of our launch plans and even still had 12 new sales in the first quarter, along with a very strong pipeline. We'll share much more about these growth plans with you at our upcoming Investor Day. Fiserv's PEP+ solution, our integrated payment platform which provides the ACH infrastructure for many of the largest banks in the U.S., recently won an Innovator Award from PYMNTS.com. The award, which recognized our same-day settlement capability, reflects the growing importance of faster payments in this country. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon. Adjusted revenue grew 5% in the quarter to $1.3 billion, and internal revenue growth was 4%. Solid execution along with some revenue timing benefits drove internal revenue growth that was slightly ahead of our expectations for the first quarter. We continue to expect internal revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year as revenue related to 2016 sales and contributions from new initiatives come online. Operating performance was strong, resulting in an 8% increase in adjusted operating income to $429 million, and also 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, to 32.5%. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 18% to $1.25, which includes the positive impact of the new accounting treatment for reporting the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation awards. This impact was somewhat offset by low adjusted tax rate in last year's comparable quarter. Our Payment segment delivered 5% internal revenue growth, led by strong growth in Card Services, Output Solutions and Investment Services. Adjusted revenue was up 7% to $720 million. Debit transaction growth for the quarter was in the high-single digits, and P2P transactions for the period grew more than 20% year-over-year. P2P growth was driven in large part by real-time transactions which were up significantly, at more than 300% in the quarter. We expect further acceleration in our P2P growth throughout 2017 and 2018 as Zelle is launched later this year. The Payment segment adjusted operating income was up 16% to $260 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 270 basis points to 36.2%, due to increases in high-quality revenue, benefits from our operational effectiveness programs and, to a lesser degree, the timing of comparable expenses. While we don't expect margins to increase at that level each quarter, we do expect strong performance in the segment for the balance of the year and into the future. The Financial segment adjusted revenue was up 4% for the quarter to $620 million. Internal revenue growth was up 4%, led by our lending solutions, account processing and international businesses. Revenue growth in the Financial segment was slightly ahead of our expectations due to the acceleration of some periodic revenue we had originally anticipated in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was just ahead of the prior year, at $196 million. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 100 basis points to 31.6%, due primarily to higher sales commissions, the timing of periodic expenses and continued investments in newer products, such as Agiliti and Notifi. The corporate adjusted operating loss in the quarter was up, due primarily to a tough prior year comparison. We expect the corporate segment to remain generally consistent with the first quarter's level for the balance of the year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with our internal expectations, at 29.4%. As discussed on our last call, we included the positive impact from adopting the new accounting standard for the excess benefit of share-based compensation on our adjusted tax rate guidance for the year. The expected benefit is front-loaded in the year due to the timing of option exercises, investing of restricted units, which can tend to be more concentrated in the first quarter when equity grants typically vest. This benefit was partially offset by a relatively low adjusted tax rate in last year's quarter, producing a net benefit of about $0.06 per share. Consistent with our prior guidance, we continue to expect a full-year adjusted effective tax rate of slightly below 33%, which translates to a tax rate for the remainder of the year of about 34%. Free cash flow was up a very strong 23% in the quarter to $366 million and up 27% on a per-share basis to $1.67, due primarily to strong operating results and positive working capital. These excellent results do not include a $31 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver joint venture. Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4.6 billion, or 2.3 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We repurchased 3.4 million shares for $389 million in the quarter, which is an increase of more than 20% over last year's comparable quarter and equates to 106% of free cash flow. As of March 31, there were 212.9 million shares outstanding and 17 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Thanks, Bob. We followed up last year's record fourth quarter sales with a solid start to the year. Overall sales in the quarter were up 30% over the prior year and up 35% domestically, led by strong Financial segment sales. Quota attainment came in at 82%, which, as you can tell by the relative performance, reflects increased sales expectations for the full year. Importantly, our domestic pipeline expanded by 17% in the quarter and we're very well-positioned to meet our sales goals for the year. Integrated sales increased 7% to $51 million in the quarter, led by Card Services, Digital Solutions and Output Solutions. Providing additional value to our existing client base is an essential part our strategy. We kicked off the second year of our $250 million five-year operational effectiveness program in the quarter and achieved $20 million of savings by primarily by procurement and labor optimization. We also continue to make great progress on our data center consolidation program, combining five locations in the quarter. We're well on track to achieve our $60 million objective for the year. The market continues to exude optimism, buoyed by the March Fed interest rate hike, a general sense that we will see some form of relief on the regulatory front and a growing confidence that tax reform of some kind will become a reality this year. These factors, combined with the prospect of additional interest rate hikes over the next six months to 12 months, is leading to a longer tail of positive sentiment than we've seen in the long time. Although the jury is out on how that may translate translate to incremental technology spend over time, we are having more conversations about technology focused on digital, commercial services, cyber security and revenue generation, which aligns well with our source as solution differentiation. Lastly, we continue to be excited about the prospects of bank-based P2P and remain quite active partnering with our clients and DWS to bring Zelle to life later this year. As I said upfront, we're on track to achieve our financial goals for the year and continue to expect internal revenue growth of 4% to 5%. Although we don't provide quarterly guidance, we did give color that the first quarter was likely to be the low point for our internal revenue growth for the year. For modeling purposes, given our strong start, we don't expect our Q2 internal revenue growth rate to be higher than that of Q1. As shared previously, we fully expect internal revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year. We continue to anticipate adjusted earnings per share will grow 14% to 17%, or $5.03 to $5.17 for the year, that adjusted operating margin will expand more than 50 basis points and that free cash flow per share will be at least $5.45 for the full year. In conclusion, we're pleased with our start to the year. We're making progress against our strategic priorities, setting ourselves up to achieve our financial outlook for the year and building momentum towards further growth acceleration in 2018. Investing in tomorrow while delivering results for today is not easy. Thankfully, we have more than 23,000 talented associates who focus their collective energy on creating superior value for clients and shareholders each and every day. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is now open. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Good afternoon. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Hi, David. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI The 30% increase in sales, Jeff, you called out 60% growth in Mobiliti as a driver. Are there are any other big drivers behind that? And to what extend do you think this elevated level of sales growth is sustainable for the balance of the year? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah. That's great. The 60% increase in Mobiliti business sales for the year is a driver of it, but it's not a significant driver. The biggest drivers of sales for the year, we had a very good quarter in our credit union business. We're making great strides on the digital front, digital including Architect, as I talked about earlier. We had good growth in our biller businesses. We had actually pretty good growth across the board. There were a couple of areas that had a little bit of a slow start because we had such a strong – you'll remember, such a strong fourth quarter and we actually had a pretty darn good third quarter as well. So, but the pipelines have been growing. Whether or not we can sustain 30% year-over-year, you'll remember that last year the first quarter was fairly soft for us. But we do believe we will have higher sales again this year and, most important, that even the pipeline with higher sales will actually be up going into 2018. So lots of good momentum in the market. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI How should we think about the time to convert these new sales into revenue? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Normal – I would say it's our normal cycles. I mean, you're talking about anywhere between six months on the low end. But really call it in the nine month to 12 month, nine month to 15 month range. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Got it. And then the big margin expansion in Payment to 32.6%. Can you talk about some of the drivers behind that expansion in a little more depth? And then to what extent is the 32% to 33% level the new high watermark? Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah, David, it's Bob. Overall, obviously, we're very pleased with the performance of the business for the quarter. There are number of things, we talked about few of them in the opening remarks. First off, I'd say we had some nice drop-through rates on our scale payments platforms. The mix of business was nicely favorable. We talked a little bit about timing of both periodic revenue as well as variable expenses. So the flow within an individual quarter was favorable for us in the first quarter. I would say that we certainly expect the full year to be strong and expect meaningful expansion of our operating margin on a year-over-year basis. I would not expect 270 basis points for the year. But certainly I'm seeing nice progress both in terms of a strong mix and a scalable business, as well as good management of expenses. And, of course, they're also benefiting from the strong operational effectiveness. You heard for the quarter, we delivered $20 million of savings on a full year expectation of $60 million. So we're off to a great start there. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Hey, David. I would add a couple of things. And this is, you know us well. So you will know this maybe our highest margin ever in the Payments segment in the quarter. And to Bob's point, while we don't expect to have 270 basis points, we are at an interesting inflection point where for, call it, the last four quarters for sure, but even a little bit before that, we were getting dragged down a bit in this segment on margin due to things like the EMV conversion. And we got that growth as we start to transition over from having that lower margin revenue go out and the higher margin continuing to build payments and Mobiliti and these ASP solutions that we've been investing in for the last several years. As those are starting to now come online combined with the moderation of the some of the investments in the Payments segment, that we would expect to see the margins really be up into this higher ZIP Code. Again, to Bob's point, not as high as they are in this quarter. But we do see the nice, nice tailwind in Payments segment margins certainly throughout this year and going into next year. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Got it. Good to hear. Just a quick final question for me. The 27% free cash flow growth year-over-year in the quarter, that's obviously much higher than your annual guidance for free cash flow growth. I'm a little curious why you're not raising the free cash flow guidance for the year. And to what extent are some of the growth we saw in the first quarter one-time in nature? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah. I mean, David, we feel really good about the performance in the quarter. We also recognize that this is the first quarter. We had some positive working capital benefits and we had been taking a little bit of a hit on working capital the last couple of quarters. And so it's just too early to make that call. We like the start. We'll see where we are in the second quarter and we'll certainly update you at that stage. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Congratulations. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Operator Our next question comes from David Koning from Baird. Your line is now open. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hi there. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Hi, David. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Hey, David. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. And I was wondering if you could just kind of isolate some of the factors. That organic revenue growth, it was about the strongest I think it's been in five quarters. And it's very, very tight range obviously. But maybe you could just talk through some of the one-off. I think you said there was a little bit of an early revenue recognition on some product that came through quicker than you thought. And maybe just parse out license and term fees and maybe a currency impact. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. So a multi-pronged question, David. Overall, obviously a good start. We did see some benefit in the quarter of positive timing, particularly in some license and term fees that came in earlier in the quarter than we had initially anticipated. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Earlier in the year. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Earlier in the year, Q2, end of Q1. Certainly like to see the performance in both segments and see the Financial segment growing a little bit nicer. Again, we certainly see some timing. And I think Jeff's opening comments when we reiterated the full-year guidance, we talked about Q2 will likely be down below Q1 levels of bit (25:15). Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. So, David, just let me add a couple things. So we continue to see really good gains in our Transactional businesses, the Debit business, P2P, you heard Bob talk about real-time. Real-time, now, arguably it's on a small base, but 300% improvement is still a 300% improvement year-over-year. We also ran a program inside the company in the first quarter that we called Fast Start. And that was really about getting people focused on driving revenue early in the year, driving sales early in the year so that we could shorten our conversion cycle. And that drove some nice license revenue because our sales – a lot of our products are license-oriented and so we got a nice start there. And this is the first quarter in a while that we haven't had much FX. As you know, we don't report constant currency and so we had kind of stabilization in FX. But, overall, we feel good about the start to the year and we feel even better about our guidance for the full year. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks for that. And then just one follow-up. You anniversaried the ACI and HP acquisitions. I know they're not big, I'm just wondering maybe you can talk a little bit how those have been growing and executing. And then, if there is any margin impact, you talked last year about a little headwind from those two. And margins are so good right now. I don't know if those are still a headwind or not. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. So the HP acquisition anniversaried, I think, in January. And I think the ACI acquisition is kind of March-ish. And so that would have still been in the quarter in terms of the – no effect on internal revenue growth and the margin would also be compressed. And those acquisitions, David, did serve to step our margins down. I want to say it was in the 20 basis points, 30 basis points in this quarter. And last year, for most of the year it was in the 30-ish basis point range. So we are growing over that. And while we won't have any compression as it anniversaries, it did serve to put a little bit of pressure on the margin. It's one of the reasons why we feel so much better about our Payments margin. The other thing I would say is, as it relates to the acquisitions, the HP acquisition was a big part of the BillMatrix Next technology that we're very enthusiastic about. We're actually going to talk about that at Investor Day. And then I mentioned that we've sold the Architect solution 14 times and have 70 institutions in the pipeline right now all looking at it. We think, again, that was responsive to the market. So no big revenue growth yet from those solutions, but a good momentum. Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah. This is Mark Ernst. The only thing I'd add to that is a lot of the cost takeouts which we talked about when we did those deals have been – we're finally getting through some of that work. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. We're just at the early stages of starting to feel it. Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc. That's it. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay. Great. Well, nice job. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Your line is now open. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Hey. Good afternoon. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Good afternoon. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC Maybe just help us reconcile the two sales figures you gave. So sales were up 30%, but quota attainment up 82%. I'm struggling a little bit with whether we should view that as a good result or not? Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah, Chris. I tried to allude to it in my remarks. The 30% year-over-year is the actual sales result versus the actual sales result last year. And as you may remember, we had kind of a weaker first quarter. But when we set our quota, we set our quota to expectations for the full year. And so we typically start out a little bit slower relative to quota in Q1. So being at 82%, even though it was much higher than last year, it's still not quite where we expect us to be for the full year. For the full year, we expect to make up those 18 percentage points that we didn't get in Q1. It's not a perfectly straight line. It doesn't perfectly match our sales cycle. So 82% is actually a reasonably good start because it not only reflects the big prior-year gain, but it reflects our increased expectations for the year. If we get to 100%, that's a very good year. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Got you. Let's see. On the cash flow, obviously a big quarter. It looks like the payable days continue to climb as they have the last several years. How much more room is there for that story to play out? And I guess do you expect, maybe not this year, but over the next few years, for free cash flow to start to look a little bit more like net income? Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Obviously, cash flow is, well, number one, a very important metric for us, and, two, been a very good story. And with our guidance for 2017, we have high expectations and have started out nicely. Part of that is the basic operating performance, so strong net income and managing that working capital. We saw working capital grow a bit in the second half of last year, particularly in receivables, and saw that come down nicely in Q1, which was a key part of the strong start to the year. We certainly anticipate continuing to manage that number down, both in terms of dollars as well as days. So it's continuing to be an opportunity for us. And certainly measuring free cash flow as a percent of net income is an important efficiency measure on the performance there. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. And, Chris, I would expect, just based on our history, we have a strong history of running above earnings. And there's no reason to believe that won't continue, given how we manage our capital outlays as well. I mean, we, I think over the last decade, maybe we've had two years, three years where we've not been above, but we're pretty consistent there. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Got you. And then, lastly, on the tax benefit that you guys are seeing. If we assume the current stock price, Bob, and can you give us some sense of what kind of that total tax benefit associated with stock comp and RSUs would look like over the next several years I guess in totally? I'm just trying to figure out what that number would be. And then, I think the 34% to 35% range is kind of the normalized tax rate range, right? Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah. So, outside of the change in accounting rules, we would've typically, as you said, had a 34% to 35% tax rate. So call it a 1.5 points, 2 points benefit, which is for this year about $0.13 or $0.14. We saw a strong performance in the first quarter. That excess tax benefit will very typically on an annual basis come in strong in the first quarter of every year, given the timing of vesting of those stock options restricted units. The $0.13 to $0.14 is what we guided to 90 days ago when we gave first guidance. And now with the first quarter behind us, we are continuing to hold that $0.13 to $0.14. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. The other thing I would say is it is difficult to predict with precision what that number will be. To your point, the stock price today is quite different than the stock price was even in the middle of the first quarter. And so where – if you said what would – it would extrapolate out higher now because we would have larger inherent gains in the employee equity portfolio. But you have to try to predict who but you have to try to predict who is going to sell when and things like that. The $0.13, $0.14 – I think Bob said $0.13, $0.14. I think that's really based on historical performance. I mean, to the extent that the share price moves, that probably gets a little bit larger, but it's going to be in that range. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. There can be some variability to this metric, which is one of the reasons why folks like me don't like having it roll through earnings per share. But given the preponderance of effect occur in the first quarter and that quarter now being behind us, that $0.13 to $0.14 should be in very good shape for a full-year basis. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Yeah. We're just struggling with how to model – figure out the valuation impact on all of our companies given the basically trying to take a present value of the tax benefit and then bake in the normalized tax rate. So thank you. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Could you maybe talk about the timing of the deal pipeline as you currently see it? I think, Jeff, you commented that Q2 growth rate wouldn't be higher than Q1. So do you expect all business that slipped into 2017 to still occur in 2017? And maybe give us a sense of how that cadence of revenue growth rolls in in Q3, Q4? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Sure. Sure, Jim. We had made a comment for modeling purposes when we gave guidance, which we don't typically do. But we had anticipated that Q1 would likely be the lowest quarter of the year and that we would generally see sequential increases after that. And that was really two-fold. It was what we could see on the periodic revenue front. It was not – actually three reasons. It was not understanding how the new Fast Start program would impact our revenue. And then, third, to your point around the ramp of sales and implementations, the only thing that's going on is really the movement of the periodic revenue, as you know. And it doesn't take very much to move our internal growth percentages. And so just based on what we see right now, we think it's prudent to model to the saying that the second quarter will likely not be higher than the first. But there's no change; we still expect the second half of the year to be higher than the first and we would expect the exit rate to the year to be indicative of where we're going to be in 2018. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks. And then maybe, Jeff, on the broad topic of regulatory reform and relief. You talked in your opening comments about some general effects. But I guess on the positive side, can you broadly talk about the impact that the CHOICE Act, if passed, would have on your business across different aspects? And then maybe on the flip side, on the negative side, can you maybe talk about if there's an ease up of regulation at banks, whether there would be any trend that you would see that would maybe trend towards less outsourcing of core platforms rather than more?  Yeah, let me take the latter piece first. The best we can tell there's no movement. And I don't see that regulatory itself will do anything other than continue to push technology burden on companies like us. And so even if and when the regulatory burden eases a bit, because of the speed in which technology is evolving and the expectations that consumers have and their desire to have their financial institutions deliver faster, more feature-rich experiences, I don't see that having any impact. We are starting to hear a little bit of discussion on things like a hybrid computing, which is a mixture of having institutions run pieces of a platform inside their four walls and having us run parts of it outside the four walls. But that's a newer trend. The discussions around cloud and all kinds of things like that. So from our perspective, we don't see a lot of risk there. And, again, we're developing more and more solutions that – investing in more and more solutions that feel cloud-esque. And that really is geared also to a lower TCO and I think that will help. On the notion of the CHOICE Act, my take on that is generally if you're going to see less regulation, that's going to be a good thing. Right now, Dodd-Frank tended to provide some protection at the community bank level. We'll have to see how this all plays out. I think for now, our belief is, net-net, regardless of what happens, you're going to see an easing of the implications to banks. Not that consumers won't be more protected, but just an easing. And that will be good and hopefully translate to some more value for them and, therefore, for us. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Arvind Ramnani of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Arvind Ramnani - Pacific Crest Securities Hi. You have outlined a pretty good picture your core clients being in better shape with this regulation and interest rates, increased interest in digital. But can you maybe help us understand what's driving confidence in second half performance and also potentially what can drive upside or downside to the second half ramp? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Sure. One of the beauties and the difficulties of our model is we sell well ahead of the implementations of the technology. And so we have a pretty good eye right now into what will get implemented in each of the, call it, the next three to four quarters. So that gives us the kind of visibility so that we have some confidence in being able to project what's going to happen. Now, the downside to that is our clients are still – they still have development queues that they have to work through and clients have to do their share and we have to do our share. So it's not an exact science, but it does give us reasonable visibility. And we have good financial rigor in the company. We learned some lessons last year on some of the challenges that we had. And so we feel confident that we'll see accelerated revenue growth in the second half of the year. Arvind Ramnani - Pacific Crest Securities Great. And then just on your Payments, your faster growing Payments business. Are there any specific areas within Payments that could drive structural secular or acceleration in growth? Or do you think Payments is going to do better, but any specific drivers that could make it grow even faster? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Sure. In all of those businesses, if you take something like debit growth, debit is growing nicely, it's growing high-single digits. And arguably debit is, in fact, a secular trend. People are using it. The adoption curves tend to lag in the community banking market from the largest banks. And so we're riding that secular trend. Mobile banking is still very early. And so we would expect that over the next five to seven to 10 years that mobile banking will be the standard. Today, about 75% of consumers use online banking. And yet there's only about 40%, 50% using mobile. And so there's a lot of additional opportunity there. And then probably the last one I would point out right now is P2P. We have been pushing P2P through our Popmoney solution for the last four or five years. We are very excited about the Zelle initiative, which is early warning systems, the large banks and the community banks, many of which are going through us, as well as a number of the large banks. And so we think that will go from a very small business. Currently, most of the pundits are saying that that could be as big as $300 billion come 2020 in terms of size of P2P market from a very small market today. So early, early stage in what we believe will become a secular trend over time. Those are just a few examples. Arvind Ramnani - Pacific Crest Securities Thank you very much. And good luck for the remainder of the year. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Hi, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. I appreciate you taking our call. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Sure. Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities I was looking at the integrated sales growth. Now it was 7%. Was that 17% last period? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. I'm sorry, would you repeat the question? Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities The integrated sales growth was 7% this period down from 17% last period? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah, it may have been. We don't really think about it on that basis. The fourth quarter of the year is typically always your biggest quarter there. So 7% sales is pretty good growth in the dollar value. If you look at the dollar value, that's the most important piece of that. And, again, that's integrated into our sales number. Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. Got it. Thanks for the clarification. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Sure. Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities And with the number coming in at $20 million already on the savings efficiency initiative, should we think of that amount probably coming over again this year as it did last year with the $60 million target? Or will that maybe possibly slow down a little bit? Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah, some of that benefit is actually that we had a strong second half of last year. And so now that's kind of rolling into the first part of this year. So not necessarily surprising to have a strong start. It's early in the year, so I'm certainly not ready to change that guidance. Some of that is new activity. And we've got a five-year program; we're in year two of it. At $60 million this year, at the end year two, at the end of this year, we'll be $120 million against a $250 million five-year goal. So we'll be in great shape. Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities All right. Thanks, guys. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Thank you. Operator Our last question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. Thanks. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Hey, Tien-Tsin. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey, Jeff. Good to talk to you. It's great, as usual. I guess a little more balanced growth between the two segments here, Payments and Financial. Should we expect tighter growth between the two for the balance of 2017? Just playing around with the model here, trying to think about comps. Anything to call out? Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah, you actually heard a couple of questions about Jeff's answer on the secular trends in the Payments segment. We typically see Payments slightly stronger than our Financial segment. That's been the last couple of years and I would anticipate that to be again this year. Clearly, in the first quarter, it was a bit more balanced. But overall, the trends in the Payments segment are a bit stronger than what we would see in the Financial segment. So the last couple of year trend I think will continue this year by the end of the year. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Although, Tien-Tsin, I would say that we do expect higher growth in the Financial segment. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Right, right. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. We're not giving guidance to your question. We do expect a little bit more growth in the Financial segment this year, given the performance last year and some of the sales and all of that. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Right. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah, that would tie up well with what you've been taking about on the call. I guess as a last question just on the M&A front. I figured I'd ask, your appetite to do acquisitions, there's been a few more deals announced I guess in the industry in Q1. PayPal is talking about the TIO Network, bill payment acquisition earlier. So I'm curious if your appetite has changed at all and what we might expect. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah, we continue to have the same capital allocation strategy that we have had. But we look it a lot. We don't buy very much, but we look at a lot. And I do see opportunities for us to get into the market faster by doing some product-oriented acquisitions. So last year we did the little – the HPE deal, we did the CFS carve-out, we did the OBS acquisition. So I think you'll see us do smaller capability-oriented acquisitions where it makes sense and it's really supportive of our strategy. I do think that's a reasonable use of capital just given how fast the market is moving right now. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Right. Terrific. I'll look for you guys at Investor Day.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is now open. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Good afternoon. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Hi, David. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI The 30% increase in sales, Jeff, you called out 60% growth in Mobiliti as a driver. Are there are any other big drivers behind that? And to what extend do you think this elevated level of sales growth is sustainable for the balance of the year? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah. That's great. The 60% increase in Mobiliti business sales for the year is a driver of it, but it's not a significant driver. The biggest drivers of sales for the year, we had a very good quarter in our credit union business. We're making great strides on the digital front, digital including Architect, as I talked about earlier. We had good growth in our biller businesses. We had actually pretty good growth across the board. There were a couple of areas that had a little bit of a slow start because we had such a strong – you'll remember, such a strong fourth quarter and we actually had a pretty darn good third quarter as well. So, but the pipelines have been growing. Whether or not we can sustain 30% year-over-year, you'll remember that last year the first quarter was fairly soft for us. But we do believe we will have higher sales again this year and, most important, that even the pipeline with higher sales will actually be up going into 2018. So lots of good momentum in the market. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI How should we think about the time to convert these new sales into revenue? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Normal – I would say it's our normal cycles. I mean, you're talking about anywhere between six months on the low end. But really call it in the nine month to 12 month, nine month to 15 month range. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Got it. And then the big margin expansion in Payment to 32.6%. Can you talk about some of the drivers behind that expansion in a little more depth? And then to what extent is the 32% to 33% level the new high watermark? Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah, David, it's Bob. Overall, obviously, we're very pleased with the performance of the business for the quarter. There are number of things, we talked about few of them in the opening remarks. First off, I'd say we had some nice drop-through rates on our scale payments platforms. The mix of business was nicely favorable. We talked a little bit about timing of both periodic revenue as well as variable expenses. So the flow within an individual quarter was favorable for us in the first quarter. I would say that we certainly expect the full year to be strong and expect meaningful expansion of our operating margin on a year-over-year basis. I would not expect 270 basis points for the year. But certainly I'm seeing nice progress both in terms of a strong mix and a scalable business, as well as good management of expenses. And, of course, they're also benefiting from the strong operational effectiveness. You heard for the quarter, we delivered $20 million of savings on a full year expectation of $60 million. So we're off to a great start there. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Hey, David. I would add a couple of things. And this is, you know us well. So you will know this maybe our highest margin ever in the Payments segment in the quarter. And to Bob's point, while we don't expect to have 270 basis points, we are at an interesting inflection point where for, call it, the last four quarters for sure, but even a little bit before that, we were getting dragged down a bit in this segment on margin due to things like the EMV conversion. And we got that growth as we start to transition over from having that lower margin revenue go out and the higher margin continuing to build payments and Mobiliti and these ASP solutions that we've been investing in for the last several years. As those are starting to now come online combined with the moderation of the some of the investments in the Payments segment, that we would expect to see the margins really be up into this higher ZIP Code. Again, to Bob's point, not as high as they are in this quarter. But we do see the nice, nice tailwind in Payments segment margins certainly throughout this year and going into next year. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Got it. Good to hear. Just a quick final question for me. The 27% free cash flow growth year-over-year in the quarter, that's obviously much higher than your annual guidance for free cash flow growth. I'm a little curious why you're not raising the free cash flow guidance for the year. And to what extent are some of the growth we saw in the first quarter one-time in nature? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah. I mean, David, we feel really good about the performance in the quarter. We also recognize that this is the first quarter. We had some positive working capital benefits and we had been taking a little bit of a hit on working capital the last couple of quarters. And so it's just too early to make that call. We like the start. We'll see where we are in the second quarter and we'll certainly update you at that stage. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Congratulations. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Operator Our next question comes from David Koning from Baird. Your line is now open. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hi there. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Hi, David. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Hey, David. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. And I was wondering if you could just kind of isolate some of the factors. That organic revenue growth, it was about the strongest I think it's been in five quarters. And it's very, very tight range obviously. But maybe you could just talk through some of the one-off. I think you said there was a little bit of an early revenue recognition on some product that came through quicker than you thought. And maybe just parse out license and term fees and maybe a currency impact. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. So a multi-pronged question, David. Overall, obviously a good start. We did see some benefit in the quarter of positive timing, particularly in some license and term fees that came in earlier in the quarter than we had initially anticipated. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Earlier in the year. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Earlier in the year, Q2, end of Q1. Certainly like to see the performance in both segments and see the Financial segment growing a little bit nicer. Again, we certainly see some timing. And I think Jeff's opening comments when we reiterated the full-year guidance, we talked about Q2 will likely be down below Q1 levels of bit (25:15). Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. So, David, just let me add a couple things. So we continue to see really good gains in our Transactional businesses, the Debit business, P2P, you heard Bob talk about real-time. Real-time, now, arguably it's on a small base, but 300% improvement is still a 300% improvement year-over-year. We also ran a program inside the company in the first quarter that we called Fast Start. And that was really about getting people focused on driving revenue early in the year, driving sales early in the year so that we could shorten our conversion cycle. And that drove some nice license revenue because our sales – a lot of our products are license-oriented and so we got a nice start there. And this is the first quarter in a while that we haven't had much FX. As you know, we don't report constant currency and so we had kind of stabilization in FX. But, overall, we feel good about the start to the year and we feel even better about our guidance for the full year. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks for that. And then just one follow-up. You anniversaried the ACI and HP acquisitions. I know they're not big, I'm just wondering maybe you can talk a little bit how those have been growing and executing. And then, if there is any margin impact, you talked last year about a little headwind from those two. And margins are so good right now. I don't know if those are still a headwind or not. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. So the HP acquisition anniversaried, I think, in January. And I think the ACI acquisition is kind of March-ish. And so that would have still been in the quarter in terms of the – no effect on internal revenue growth and the margin would also be compressed. And those acquisitions, David, did serve to step our margins down. I want to say it was in the 20 basis points, 30 basis points in this quarter. And last year, for most of the year it was in the 30-ish basis point range. So we are growing over that. And while we won't have any compression as it anniversaries, it did serve to put a little bit of pressure on the margin. It's one of the reasons why we feel so much better about our Payments margin. The other thing I would say is, as it relates to the acquisitions, the HP acquisition was a big part of the BillMatrix Next technology that we're very enthusiastic about. We're actually going to talk about that at Investor Day. And then I mentioned that we've sold the Architect solution 14 times and have 70 institutions in the pipeline right now all looking at it. We think, again, that was responsive to the market. So no big revenue growth yet from those solutions, but a good momentum. Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah. This is Mark Ernst. The only thing I'd add to that is a lot of the cost takeouts which we talked about when we did those deals have been – we're finally getting through some of that work. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. We're just at the early stages of starting to feel it. Mark A. Ernst - Fiserv, Inc. That's it. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay. Great. Well, nice job. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Your line is now open. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Hey. Good afternoon. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Good afternoon. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC Maybe just help us reconcile the two sales figures you gave. So sales were up 30%, but quota attainment up 82%. I'm struggling a little bit with whether we should view that as a good result or not? Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah, Chris. I tried to allude to it in my remarks. The 30% year-over-year is the actual sales result versus the actual sales result last year. And as you may remember, we had kind of a weaker first quarter. But when we set our quota, we set our quota to expectations for the full year. And so we typically start out a little bit slower relative to quota in Q1. So being at 82%, even though it was much higher than last year, it's still not quite where we expect us to be for the full year. For the full year, we expect to make up those 18 percentage points that we didn't get in Q1. It's not a perfectly straight line. It doesn't perfectly match our sales cycle. So 82% is actually a reasonably good start because it not only reflects the big prior-year gain, but it reflects our increased expectations for the year. If we get to 100%, that's a very good year. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Got you. Let's see. On the cash flow, obviously a big quarter. It looks like the payable days continue to climb as they have the last several years. How much more room is there for that story to play out? And I guess do you expect, maybe not this year, but over the next few years, for free cash flow to start to look a little bit more like net income? Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Obviously, cash flow is, well, number one, a very important metric for us, and, two, been a very good story. And with our guidance for 2017, we have high expectations and have started out nicely. Part of that is the basic operating performance, so strong net income and managing that working capital. We saw working capital grow a bit in the second half of last year, particularly in receivables, and saw that come down nicely in Q1, which was a key part of the strong start to the year. We certainly anticipate continuing to manage that number down, both in terms of dollars as well as days. So it's continuing to be an opportunity for us. And certainly measuring free cash flow as a percent of net income is an important efficiency measure on the performance there. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. And, Chris, I would expect, just based on our history, we have a strong history of running above earnings. And there's no reason to believe that won't continue, given how we manage our capital outlays as well. I mean, we, I think over the last decade, maybe we've had two years, three years where we've not been above, but we're pretty consistent there. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Got you. And then, lastly, on the tax benefit that you guys are seeing. If we assume the current stock price, Bob, and can you give us some sense of what kind of that total tax benefit associated with stock comp and RSUs would look like over the next several years I guess in totally? I'm just trying to figure out what that number would be. And then, I think the 34% to 35% range is kind of the normalized tax rate range, right? Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah. So, outside of the change in accounting rules, we would've typically, as you said, had a 34% to 35% tax rate. So call it a 1.5 points, 2 points benefit, which is for this year about $0.13 or $0.14. We saw a strong performance in the first quarter. That excess tax benefit will very typically on an annual basis come in strong in the first quarter of every year, given the timing of vesting of those stock options restricted units. The $0.13 to $0.14 is what we guided to 90 days ago when we gave first guidance. And now with the first quarter behind us, we are continuing to hold that $0.13 to $0.14. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. The other thing I would say is it is difficult to predict with precision what that number will be. To your point, the stock price today is quite different than the stock price was even in the middle of the first quarter. And so where – if you said what would – it would extrapolate out higher now because we would have larger inherent gains in the employee equity portfolio. But you have to try to predict who but you have to try to predict who is going to sell when and things like that. The $0.13, $0.14 – I think Bob said $0.13, $0.14. I think that's really based on historical performance. I mean, to the extent that the share price moves, that probably gets a little bit larger, but it's going to be in that range. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. There can be some variability to this metric, which is one of the reasons why folks like me don't like having it roll through earnings per share. But given the preponderance of effect occur in the first quarter and that quarter now being behind us, that $0.13 to $0.14 should be in very good shape for a full-year basis. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Yeah. We're just struggling with how to model – figure out the valuation impact on all of our companies given the basically trying to take a present value of the tax benefit and then bake in the normalized tax rate. So thank you. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Could you maybe talk about the timing of the deal pipeline as you currently see it? I think, Jeff, you commented that Q2 growth rate wouldn't be higher than Q1. So do you expect all business that slipped into 2017 to still occur in 2017? And maybe give us a sense of how that cadence of revenue growth rolls in in Q3, Q4? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Sure. Sure, Jim. We had made a comment for modeling purposes when we gave guidance, which we don't typically do. But we had anticipated that Q1 would likely be the lowest quarter of the year and that we would generally see sequential increases after that. And that was really two-fold. It was what we could see on the periodic revenue front. It was not – actually three reasons. It was not understanding how the new Fast Start program would impact our revenue. And then, third, to your point around the ramp of sales and implementations, the only thing that's going on is really the movement of the periodic revenue, as you know. And it doesn't take very much to move our internal growth percentages. And so just based on what we see right now, we think it's prudent to model to the saying that the second quarter will likely not be higher than the first. But there's no change; we still expect the second half of the year to be higher than the first and we would expect the exit rate to the year to be indicative of where we're going to be in 2018. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks. And then maybe, Jeff, on the broad topic of regulatory reform and relief. You talked in your opening comments about some general effects. But I guess on the positive side, can you broadly talk about the impact that the CHOICE Act, if passed, would have on your business across different aspects? And then maybe on the flip side, on the negative side, can you maybe talk about if there's an ease up of regulation at banks, whether there would be any trend that you would see that would maybe trend towards less outsourcing of core platforms rather than more?  Yeah, let me take the latter piece first. The best we can tell there's no movement. And I don't see that regulatory itself will do anything other than continue to push technology burden on companies like us. And so even if and when the regulatory burden eases a bit, because of the speed in which technology is evolving and the expectations that consumers have and their desire to have their financial institutions deliver faster, more feature-rich experiences, I don't see that having any impact. We are starting to hear a little bit of discussion on things like a hybrid computing, which is a mixture of having institutions run pieces of a platform inside their four walls and having us run parts of it outside the four walls. But that's a newer trend. The discussions around cloud and all kinds of things like that. So from our perspective, we don't see a lot of risk there. And, again, we're developing more and more solutions that – investing in more and more solutions that feel cloud-esque. And that really is geared also to a lower TCO and I think that will help. On the notion of the CHOICE Act, my take on that is generally if you're going to see less regulation, that's going to be a good thing. Right now, Dodd-Frank tended to provide some protection at the community bank level. We'll have to see how this all plays out. I think for now, our belief is, net-net, regardless of what happens, you're going to see an easing of the implications to banks. Not that consumers won't be more protected, but just an easing. And that will be good and hopefully translate to some more value for them and, therefore, for us. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Arvind Ramnani of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Arvind Ramnani - Pacific Crest Securities Hi. You have outlined a pretty good picture your core clients being in better shape with this regulation and interest rates, increased interest in digital. But can you maybe help us understand what's driving confidence in second half performance and also potentially what can drive upside or downside to the second half ramp? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Sure. One of the beauties and the difficulties of our model is we sell well ahead of the implementations of the technology. And so we have a pretty good eye right now into what will get implemented in each of the, call it, the next three to four quarters. So that gives us the kind of visibility so that we have some confidence in being able to project what's going to happen. Now, the downside to that is our clients are still – they still have development queues that they have to work through and clients have to do their share and we have to do our share. So it's not an exact science, but it does give us reasonable visibility. And we have good financial rigor in the company. We learned some lessons last year on some of the challenges that we had. And so we feel confident that we'll see accelerated revenue growth in the second half of the year. Arvind Ramnani - Pacific Crest Securities Great. And then just on your Payments, your faster growing Payments business. Are there any specific areas within Payments that could drive structural secular or acceleration in growth? Or do you think Payments is going to do better, but any specific drivers that could make it grow even faster? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Sure. In all of those businesses, if you take something like debit growth, debit is growing nicely, it's growing high-single digits. And arguably debit is, in fact, a secular trend. People are using it. The adoption curves tend to lag in the community banking market from the largest banks. And so we're riding that secular trend. Mobile banking is still very early. And so we would expect that over the next five to seven to 10 years that mobile banking will be the standard. Today, about 75% of consumers use online banking. And yet there's only about 40%, 50% using mobile. And so there's a lot of additional opportunity there. And then probably the last one I would point out right now is P2P. We have been pushing P2P through our Popmoney solution for the last four or five years. We are very excited about the Zelle initiative, which is early warning systems, the large banks and the community banks, many of which are going through us, as well as a number of the large banks. And so we think that will go from a very small business. Currently, most of the pundits are saying that that could be as big as $300 billion come 2020 in terms of size of P2P market from a very small market today. So early, early stage in what we believe will become a secular trend over time. Those are just a few examples. Arvind Ramnani - Pacific Crest Securities Thank you very much. And good luck for the remainder of the year. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Hi, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. I appreciate you taking our call. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Sure. Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities I was looking at the integrated sales growth. Now it was 7%. Was that 17% last period? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. I'm sorry, would you repeat the question? Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities The integrated sales growth was 7% this period down from 17% last period? Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah, it may have been. We don't really think about it on that basis. The fourth quarter of the year is typically always your biggest quarter there. So 7% sales is pretty good growth in the dollar value. If you look at the dollar value, that's the most important piece of that. And, again, that's integrated into our sales number. Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. Got it. Thanks for the clarification. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Sure. Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities And with the number coming in at $20 million already on the savings efficiency initiative, should we think of that amount probably coming over again this year as it did last year with the $60 million target? Or will that maybe possibly slow down a little bit? Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah, some of that benefit is actually that we had a strong second half of last year. And so now that's kind of rolling into the first part of this year. So not necessarily surprising to have a strong start. It's early in the year, so I'm certainly not ready to change that guidance. Some of that is new activity. And we've got a five-year program; we're in year two of it. At $60 million this year, at the end year two, at the end of this year, we'll be $120 million against a $250 million five-year goal. So we'll be in great shape. Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities All right. Thanks, guys. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Thank you. Operator Our last question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. Thanks. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Hey, Tien-Tsin. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey, Jeff. Good to talk to you. It's great, as usual. I guess a little more balanced growth between the two segments here, Payments and Financial. Should we expect tighter growth between the two for the balance of 2017? Just playing around with the model here, trying to think about comps. Anything to call out? Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah, you actually heard a couple of questions about Jeff's answer on the secular trends in the Payments segment. We typically see Payments slightly stronger than our Financial segment. That's been the last couple of years and I would anticipate that to be again this year. Clearly, in the first quarter, it was a bit more balanced. But overall, the trends in the Payments segment are a bit stronger than what we would see in the Financial segment. So the last couple of year trend I think will continue this year by the end of the year. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Although, Tien-Tsin, I would say that we do expect higher growth in the Financial segment. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Right, right. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. We're not giving guidance to your question. We do expect a little bit more growth in the Financial segment this year, given the performance last year and some of the sales and all of that. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Right. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah, that would tie up well with what you've been taking about on the call. I guess as a last question just on the M&A front. I figured I'd ask, your appetite to do acquisitions, there's been a few more deals announced I guess in the industry in Q1. PayPal is talking about the TIO Network, bill payment acquisition earlier. So I'm curious if your appetite has changed at all and what we might expect. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. Yeah, we continue to have the same capital allocation strategy that we have had. But we look it a lot. We don't buy very much, but we look at a lot. And I do see opportunities for us to get into the market faster by doing some product-oriented acquisitions. So last year we did the little – the HPE deal, we did the CFS carve-out, we did the OBS acquisition. So I think you'll see us do smaller capability-oriented acquisitions where it makes sense and it's really supportive of our strategy. I do think that's a reasonable use of capital just given how fast the market is moving right now. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Right. Terrific. I'll look for you guys at Investor Day. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. All right. Thanks so much. Robert W. Hau - Fiserv, Inc. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Jeffery W. Yabuki - Fiserv, Inc. All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We are really looking forward to seeing you at Investor Day on June 20. If you have any questions, please give our team a call. Thanks so much.

Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Operator Good afternoon. My name is Ian and I'll be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference. Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc. Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO, and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the March quarter and then we'll open the call for questions. Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website. Let me now turn the call over to Lorenzo. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Thank you, Rick. Sales in the March quarter increased for the sixth consecutive quarter to $609 million, up 4% sequentially and up 7% on a year-over-year basis. Growth was driven by our Advanced Products, which increased 9% sequentially to a new record. Gross margin was 69.5%, at the high end of our guidance, due primarily to favorable end market mix. Operating expense was $250 million. This was $6 million higher than guided as we accelerated some 16-nanometer tape-out expenses to extend our technology leadership and add some increased litigation expense. Operating income for the quarter increased 6% sequentially to $173 million or 28.5%. Other income and expense was an expense of $2.2 million, better than guided due primarily to investment gains. Tax rate was 10% for the quarter due to discrete item. Our net income for Q4 was $153 million or $0.57 per share. We are pleased to have delivered on our financial plan in fiscal 2017. We met our target of 6% revenue growth, driven by a 45% increase in Advanced Products, and operating margin was 30% for the year. This profitability led to the generation of a record $934 million in operating cash flow. Finally, our EPS was $2.32 for the year, a 13% increase over FY 2016. Now, some key points on the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in gross cash and $2 billion in net cash after our debt. Accounts receivables decreased by nearly $100 million, as we collected last quarter's higher than normal receivables balance. Inventory was $227 million, up $21 million from the prior quarter, with nearly all the increase coming from our Advanced Products. Operating cash flow was $306 million for the quarter. In the quarter, we paid $82 million in dividends, and we repurchased 1.8 million shares for $108 million, an average price of $58.45. We ended the quarter with diluted shares at 267 million, which included the impact of 15 million shares from the convertible and the warrant associated with it. For a complete explanation of the impact of these instruments on share count, please refer to our convertible FAQ on our Investor Relations website. As we have discussed, capital allocation remains a top priority for the company. This year, we returned $855 million to shareholders through $333 million of dividends and $522 million of share repurchases. This total capital return is $90 million more than we returned to shareholders in the prior year. Our board recently authorized an increase to our dividend for the 12th consecutive year. We continue to execute on our share repurchase program with the intention of exhausting our $1 billion authorization over the next several quarters. We currently have $680 million left on that authorization. Now to guidance. In the June quarter, we are expecting sales to be between $600 million and $630 million. Our backlog is up heading into the quarter, and we are expecting continued growth in our Advanced Products. On end markets, we expect the communications category to be up, industrial and A&D categories is expected to be flat sequentially. And, lastly, broadcast, consumer and automotive is expected to be slightly down. Our gross margin will be approximately 68% to 70%. We expect operating expense to decline to approximately $242 million, including $1 million of amortization. Other income will be $1 million. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be between 12% and 15%. We will provide full year FY 2018 guidance at our upcoming Analyst Meeting in New York City on May 22. We look forward to seeing you all at that meeting. Let me now turn the call over to Moshe. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Thank you, Lorenzo. I am extremely pleased with our March quarter financial results. Sales increased 4% sequentially to $609 million, marking the sixth consecutive growth quarter. Gross margin was at the high end of our range. The combination of higher sales and higher gross margin drove our strong operating profit growth. We continue to benefit from our diversified multimarket portfolio. Five of our eight end markets increased in the quarter. The automotive and test measurement and emulation markets drove the largest incremental sales increases, and both delivered new record revenue levels. Overall, revenue growth continues to be driven by our Advanced Products, which increased 9% on a sequential basis and 45% overall on an annual basis. This category now comprises 49% overall of our revenue. 28-nanometer product family very significantly surpassed $200 million in the quarter, setting by far a very significant PLD industry record. 20-nanometer generated $60 million in sales, driven by a very broad base of markets. 16-nanometer sales grew significantly in the March quarter to a new record, significantly exceeding our forecast with sales from all of our end markets. Our Zynq SoC platform, which includes both our 28-nanometer and 16-nanometer product offerings, increased nearly 20% sequentially and now represents more than 10% of our overall revenue. One of our key 16-nanometer customers is Amazon Web Services. Just last week, AWS announced the general availability of our FPGAs for cloud-based acceleration. Our world-class silicon technology, coupled with our optimized software tools, allow AWS to offer optimizable and programmable hardware acceleration to their users. I'm very excited by this because this has the potential to create a new disruptive business model for our technology, where the flexibility of the programmable logic is an inherent benefit over fixed-function ASICs, thereby expanding our reach into a much broader set of customers and applications. More broadly, our investment and exceptional execution at the 16-nanometer node has extended our competitive lead to approximately 18 months. We are now shipping 14 unique products to more than 450 discrete customers. This represents a substantial increase from last quarter, where we shipped 12 unique products to 300 customers. Additionally, we recently announced a major expansion of the 16-nanometer portfolio with our All Programmable RF SoC product family. This is a disruptive integration and architectural breakthrough to 5G wireless with RF class analog technology. This family provides 50% to 75% power and dramatic footprint reduction, 5G, cable and wireless backhaul applications. Lorenzo mentioned we're extremely pleased that we delivered on our commitment of 6% revenue growth for fiscal year 2017. We remain committed to delivering to our longer-term operating margin target of 30% plus. Our June quarterly guidance of $600 million to $630 million will again be driven from broad-based growth in our Advanced Products portfolio. As I mentioned before, this is already 49% of our current business, and hence helps drive our overall revenue forward. I look forward to sharing more details on fiscal year 2018 with you at our Analyst Meeting on May 22 in New York. Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Our first question is from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you very much. And, Lorenzo, good to see the accounts receivable come down. That had caused a lot of consternation last quarter. Moshe, I had a question on inferencing. And I know that the investment case for Xilinx is not just on AI and machine learning, but there has been a lot of talk about it and you guys are showing up as well in the inferencing market. So my question is, help us understand some of the benchmarks. And I don't expect you to get into a blog fest with the existing or potential customer, but Google put out a TPU specs against the GPU against the CPU. Where do the FPGAs stack up? Latency, throughput, anything you are willing and able to share will be very helpful. Thank you. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Okay. Well, I'll do my best. But realistically, we're going to provide a lot more information on this topic on May 22. So I encourage you to look for more detail then. But generally speaking, first and foremost, the most valuable element we have is actually in the flexibility, and that is inherent to the programmable logic, and that is something which is very, very, very difficult to provide in an ASIC. And similarly, it's quite difficult to provide in a similar way at least using a CPU and a GPU. And the importance of flexibility is that even though it sort of sounds like machine learning and inferencing and all of that, we are into the 70th year of hearing about it. Reality is it's an emerging technology with very broad applicability where the benchmarks are very dynamic and the ones which are important today are going to be likely totally useless two or three years from now. And the biggest benefit we have is the fact that our devices can be programmed to match the new payloads and new algorithms, right. Now, so that's sort of the generic thing, and I think everyone sort of misses that, and that's why I'm starting with this long semi-diatribe on this issue because that sort of is something that I think the market underestimates the inherent advantage we have there. Now, if you sort of look at a specific set of applications, generally speaking, on things which do not require floating point, we tend to have higher performance and lower power than all other options. Now, if you take one fixed application and you target a dedicated ASIC to it, yes, I'm sure they can do better, but then if anything changes then that ASIC all of a sudden becomes a lot less attractive on the new application, whereas the programmable logic can be modified to adapt to that. And so generally speaking, we have much better performance than CPUs and GPUs for everything except floating point for each application and we have performance which is generally on par to a fixed but actually the biggest benefit is in the flexibility of our products and the fact they can be adapted. With regards to specific benchmarks we can share the numbers we have with you, and we would be happy to do that. And this is one of the reasons that we're so excited about this market. And if you sort of look at Amazon in addition to the inherent technology advantage we provide, it actually provides us with a perfect conduit to a very broad set of new customers. So both in terms of technology and access to the technology, this is a tremendous benefit for us. And we'll talk a little more about that too. I think I've overstayed my welcome on this. Operator And our next question is from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc. John? Operator John, your line is open. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Can you guys hear me now? Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc. Yes. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Yes. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Moshe? Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Yes, we can hear you. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Congratulations on the strong results. I guess, Moshe, my question is pretty simple. Up until about two or three months ago, a lot of our field work was suggesting that, while FPGAs were a great architecture for accelerators in the data center, there were still a lot of software compatibility issues. And I guess we've been fairly impressed over the last three or four months how quickly some of those software issues, programmable issues, have been resolved. So I guess my question to you is, relative to three or even six months ago, how is the acceleration opportunity today versus then? At last year's Analyst Day, I think you talked about $250 million of potential incremental revenue by 2020. I wonder if you'd just give us a sense of whether or not relative to those expectations the acceleration market is actually accelerating? And I apologize for the pun. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Okay. So you're right. Last year, at our Analyst Day, we projected it to be between $200 million to 300 million in the calendar year 2020 timeframe. At the time we gave those projections, we were aware of the engagement with Amazon, but we were unaware of what they were planning on doing with it. And so for us, we have lots of customers. And actually all of the big hyperscalers are customers, but they don't always initially share what their plans are. What has happened over the past year, and in particular with Amazon, and that became clear only at the tail end of the calendar year, so I think it was November at the very earliest that we sort of found out what it is that they wanted to do. We also detected that in order to make them successful, we needed to prioritize the software environment, which was something we were working on, but was probably at least a year away. We identified that that needed to be raised in terms of priority, and a lot of resource was put in place. Now, they've moved very, very quickly. We have been delighted to support them with their very significant requirements, and at the beginning of the calendar year, they actually opened it up to limited release, and the limited release enabled FPGA experts to access the technology. So the technology became available in the cloud, but it was available to a limited set of customers. And when they announced general availability, then that's a much broader set of customers. So the change is that Amazon has now legitimized this, is putting it in the cloud. The software, which was clearly a handicap we had, we have invested very heavily and now the results the customers are seeing are very positive, and there's a follow-up release less than a month from now which will even broaden the target customer base even more significantly than it does. Now, the underlying question is how much can this do for revenue, and I think it's still too early to predict that. Clearly, the potential is there for it either to be larger or for it to happen a little earlier. It's still unlikely to impact the next 18 months in a significant way, but it is possible that by 2020, if this goes well, that the market could be larger than what we said, and this is for our technology, or it could maybe happen faster in 2019. But what we're really trying to do is, we don't want to sort of generate any short-term frostiness because there really is not the proof in terms of deployment to justify that. There is the potential of that happening in a little further-out timeframe than what I think most people are looking at. And so there is goodness and there is goodness in the technology. There is goodness in the opportunity, and there is definitely tremendous potential with Amazon putting this up in the cloud and making it available to everyone broadly. And they were very clear. You can look at their blog. They sort of said this is initially being deployed in one location. If that is successful, then the implication there is that there could be significant deployment in other locations, which in of itself would be an accelerator or a potential enhancer of the business. But that first deployment needs to be successful. And obviously both Amazon and Xilinx are working hand in hand to do the best we can to support it. Operator And our next question is from the line of Tristan Gerra from Robert W. Baird. Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hi. Good afternoon. Similar question in the ADAS business. How should we look at this business medium term for Xilinx? You've mentioned a high 20s market share in the past. Do you think that there is a trend where FPGAs can actually gain share against ASIC in that market? And we know the product cycles are very long. And is programmability as critical as it is in the other market that you just discussed? Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Well, the programmability and the flexibility is valuable in this market, because this again is a market which is in flux. It is changing rapidly. What we are now deployed in is ADAS. We have a lot of design wins in advanced ADAS. Those put us in a good position to transition into the automated or autonomous driving over time. We think that this is a process which, until it really becomes mainstream and very, very broadly deployed, it has a 10 to a 15-year horizon until that sort of happens. And at that point in time, it wouldn't surprise me if it becomes significantly commoditized. But until it gets to that point, we do believe that the programmability is a major asset that we have. And this is a market we identified early, and we think that for the next two generations of deployments over the next five to seven years, we're in a very good position. And our market share should grow a lot of the growth this current quarter in our automotive numbers, which hit a new record were due to a surge in ADAS. And we'll give more data with regards to our overall practical businesses in May, but you can be sure that automotive is likely to be the highest growing or amongst the highest growing markets for our next year projections. Next question, please. Operator And our next question is from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the Zynq being over 10% of revenues. I was kind of excited about that. Can you just talk a little bit about what the drivers are? And you've talked about the number of design wins that you have in Zynq, the mountain of design wins, I think you've referred to it as. Where are we in terms of monetizing that and how much do you think, how long do you think that you can grow at the rate that you have been in that Zynq product? Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Well, if you look at the Zynq products offering, it was introduced at the tail end of our 28-nanometer, so I believe the first tape-out was at the end of 2011 for Zynq. And then silicon was probably available a year later, and we got a lot of design wins in three initial markets which it was targeted at were wireless, and it was won a lot of business in wireless. Actually it's at the core of our wireless strategy. Most of the deployment that you're seeing now in wireless at Xilinx or a lot of it is Zynq-based. Second area, and this was a major driver for the definition of the product, was automotive, and that's a market that takes quite a bit longer, but is now hitting its stride. And the third is industrial control, and that's where we have the proverbial mountain of design wins, which are now starting to turn to revenue, and that's just a function of how long it takes. What we're seeing in parallel is a second generation Zynq that was targeted at the high and mid range of the market at 16-nanometer, but what we've done is we've since taken the 28 nanometer and expanded it down to lower-end devices. So, you can tell from that that we expect it to be a big driver going forward and at 7-nanometer it's going to be part and parcel of a broad deployment in our technology, because we believe that at that point, 7-nanometer, it's going to be an integration play. And nearly all of our customers will use the high-performance multi-CPU cores, which are part of that in their technology. So, if you sort of look at it, it's grown from 0% to 10% of our business. And my expectation is that it can grow from 10% to 20% much faster than it took to grow to 10%. And maybe we'll try and quantify how much faster, but it's now no longer a new wonder. And just the repeat business that we can get in of itself should be a major driver in addition to the expansion that we have. And if you go far enough into the future, it's likely that close to 100% of our business over time will be driven by the Zynq product offering. But that's probably 10 years out. That's probably not now. Operator And our next question is from the line of C.G. (sic) [C.J.] (27:23) Muse from Evercore. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess the question here is you guided comm and data center up sequentially. Curious if you could talk about what you've embedded in the guide for incremental growth from the data center. And then as a quick housekeeping question, if you could offer your outlook for share count for the June quarter. Thanks so much. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Yeah. So two things. So I might frustrate you by not being very precise. But in the comms, we do show data center. We do expect data center to grow meaningfully. And again that's in the context of some of our older data center business not growing as much as we would like. And in certain cases, our design wins that we've had were slowing down. So we do think that, in summary, that the data center growth, which is part of the overall comms growth, all the end other markets in the comms area we expect to be growing as well, but the data center growth will be driven by hyperscale. Then with regard to share count, so I haven't been providing detailed share count guidance for the past couple of quarters for a couple reasons. One is I don't want to kind of signal exactly what we're doing on our buyback. And the second part is, the complexity of the convert and its impact on our diluted share count is hard to describe briefly. So I would though recommend you, CJ, go to our website. We're going to update what we expect to be the impact on diluted share count from the redemption of the convert in this quarter. Like I said, it's fairly complex, but we've tried to make it understandable. And you will see that it will have a significant impact in this current fiscal quarter, and then because of the way the accounting is done for the share count, it will actually even translate to a further reduction in the next quarter. So I mean, I will actually, I'm happy to take a follow-up if there's something specifically you were looking for, but I'm not going to give you a precise share count guide. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC No, that's very helpful. Thanks so much. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Yeah. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Thank you. Next question. Operator Our next question is from the line of John Vinh from Pacific Crest. John N. Vinh - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Question on 5G. I think you guys have talked about your 5G trial win rate at roughly 9% plus. Also if you think about 5G as versus 4G, you've got a 3x to 5x increase in radio heads, which is an area that you historically have done extremely well. And you've also announced the RF SoC, which gives you an opportunity to expand your footprint because it integrates additional discretes. So, I was wondering if you could just put into context, how do we think about the 5G opportunity versus 4G. Right, and conceptually it sounds like a very sizable opportunity, but I'm just wondering if you could also just talk about what are the other offsets that we should be thinking about. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Okay. So great questions, actually. There's a whole series of very detailed questions. So we will try and give you more clarity on that in May, but let me give you Reader's Digest. The broad deployment of 5G is expected to start in earnest in 2020 and we believe we're going to have a very good position there based on the design wins we have. It is indeed quite likely that at least on the radio head side there will be a larger number than was done, you know, than were deployed in 4G. And fundamentally 5G is going to be essential in terms of enabling the infrastructure or a whole host of things which are extremely visible today, like this entire industrial IoT. To do that well, the 5G technology is going to be a key enabler there. So we absolutely agree that the potential is larger. Our technology position is very strong. We think that between now and 2020, there is going to be ongoing deployment for 4G, including there is going to be additional rounds even in China, which is now the tail end of I think the fifth round of LTE deployment. And they will do a sixth round that is expected to be about two-thirds of the size of the fifth round, but that's still a very significant number. India is going strong, and there is other countries in the world where there is deployment. So if you look at the overall wireless business, we expect it to hover around the mid-point of, for us, our high was close to $150 million a quarter. Our low was $75 million. We expect to hover around the midpoint over the next few years on average until the 5G starts in earnest. Our technology position makes us very confident that during these next two years, all of the pre-5G deployment is likely to benefit us. And then when the real thing starts, then that's when you could see it approaching or maybe even surpassing the previous levels. But that's a few years away in terms of hitting over $150 million per quarter. We don't see that happening any time soon. Hope that answers your question, and we'll try and give more visibility into that in May. Operator And our next question is from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Moshe, I'm wondering, as we head into the Analyst Day, in order to prepare for it, what should we be thinking about sort of the puts and takes that could take your top line above or below this year's roughly 6% growth? Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Well, we'll give you an annual projection. And we're delighted that we have, if you look at one year, we have 100% hit rate in terms of hitting that number. If you look back more than one year, we have a very low hit rate. And we're very proud of actually delivering the 6% on the nose and actually just exceeding that. But we will provide you with guidance. I think the thing that gets overlooked and despite the fact that we emphasize it again and again and again is, we benefit immensely from the multimarket portion, and that sort of provides us with a lot less volatility than most other players. And what we'll try to do is to highlight which of these markets are likely to, or have the potential of doing better, which are just likely to hit the natural growth rate and which some of them, for better or for worse are below the growth rate. And we'll sort of highlight those, but there are sort of eight disparate markets and they all tend to have somewhat different dynamics. The ones which get the sexiest and get the most air time are data center and automotive, but we're actually doing very well on A&D. We're doing very well on test and measurement. We've done better than most other semiconductor or all other semiconductor companies on wireless, in a time where the wireless industry has not done well. So, I think the under-appreciated part is the multimarket portion. And if I have a request is that you'll come with some openness with regards to hearing about the other markets, even if they're less, have less curb appeal than the ones everyone is talking about. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. That was a very artfully phrased question, too. Good for that. Operator And our next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea of what you expect 16-nanometer revenues might be in the current fiscal year, fiscal 2018? Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. We will give you guidelines for that in May. It's too early, but it's done great, and a lot of that is driven by the Amazon deployment, but it's not all of it. There's actually, you can just tell from the number of customers in the number of markets we're in that it's doing better. It's actually getting deployed faster than any other technology we have seen in the past and we're also benefiting from a very favorable competitive position. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay, great. And for my follow-up, can you give us any idea of whether you're seeing any pickup in defense, in sales into the defense segment? Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Well, there was a nice pickup this quarter. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. It's generally been on an upward trend as design wins that we have, one in our 28-nanometer generation ramp in. As you know, in defense, it's a very, very long-tailed business. So at any point one time, we have multiple generations, multiple of our product generations being sold into the industry. So given our competitive position and strength of design wins and our continued design wins in large opportunities like Joint Strike Fighter, we feel very good about the business. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. It's already the third largest. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Largest business. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Market we're in, and it's not that far away from wired and wireless. Smaller than wired and wireless, but it's approaching those numbers. Operator Our next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to circle back to the AWS announcement, just kind of the concept of FPGAs as a service, or available in the cloud. And kind of what size of consumers do you think would use this, whether you'd see any larger scale customers deploy it, or is this more for smaller? And then you can you just talk about competitive landscape there, if you expect you'd be the only offering or if you would see any from Altera as well? Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. So there's seven big players, and we are talking to all seven of them. The one which has the largest existing deployment is Microsoft, and that is using the Intel slash Altera for that. We believe we have a product which is so much better than that, that obviously that is at the core of our success with all of the players. With regards to the breadth of the usage, the beauty of this is, in particular in the Amazon case, is that this enables a broad new set of applications to evolve in a way which the traditional way of pursuing the business was just not capable of doing. And it is inherent to the Amazon model that they don't actually know themselves yet, because they don't have the end system expertise. They're not experts in all of these areas. What they do and what they are experts at monetizing is making it easy to use and making it available and then enabling an amazing ecosystem where the players use it. And what we are seeing and just they talked about thousands of customers applying from the very first minute, several hundreds getting access during the limited release and then being open to the potentially thousands of customers in the general availability. Our expectation is as this unfolds, and that's why we're being cagey on providing numbers, right. That's sort of what we're trying to – we believe this could have a viral impact and not only would it be used in a public cloud sort of applications like Amazon, but when people start seeing the benefits of that, they'll just think that even for their specific applications, they could see huge improvements. And as this transition is happening into a world where machine learning is becoming broadly used for a whole host of applications, that these sort of open up and hence there's huge potential there. Also, that's the reason that we are loath to try to quantify it yet. But yet, all of this change is quite a monumental one in terms of accessibility, in terms of ease of use, and the breadth of the benefits and the benefit of the programmability, because there are some misguided notions that an ASIC by definition is better than an FPGA. This is the one set of applications which an ASIC, due to the fact that it takes years to design and it's very rigid, you could do a wonderful job designing absolutely the wrong ASIC, and then deploy it at a time where the market has changed, whereas if you use programmable logic, you can change it in situ, in live applications and it can adapt to these new applications and benchmarks, so hence the benefits. The other benefit is that a lot of these applications, in particular on the inference side tend to have more of a integer nature to them as opposed to the traditional floating point applications. And as a result, and it's sometimes it's a flexible integer format that they use, and there is nothing more flexible or better than programmable logic in terms of doing that. So I know I haven't quite answered your question, but I think that's the potential. Lorenzo, also? Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Yeah. So I think an element of your question, Blayne, was maybe related to whether the applications on AWS are kind of nichy or small or whether there's some big entities using it. And the launch partners range obviously from some smaller entities to some very large entities, and they're doing a range of applications that are fundamental to each of the companies in the core businesses. So I do think the scaling opportunity is there and very well represented. Operator And our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Just one near-term question. The guidance for the June quarter for industrial, aerospace and defense being flat and then down in the broadcast, consumer and auto segment, could you give a little bit more color about the moving parts in that? And then maybe a slightly longer-term aspect of it, I know you said that automotive would be a fast grower, and you'll give us more details at the Analyst Meeting in May. But the other part of that equation, the broadcast and consumer, has been a bit of a headwind for a couple of years. So I just wondered what the trajectory of that might be over the course of the year. Thanks. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Yeah. So the industrial A&D softness is due to program-specific things in defense primarily. The rest of the business areas are relatively going to be flat relatively quarter on quarter. In the automotive, consumer, broadcast space, as we've mentioned in this call already, we've set a record in automotive. And if you go back a quarter, we talked about kind of a low based on some inventory things. So we're going to see a little bit of dip in automotive. And by the way, though we expect a longer-term trend upward based on the strength of our ADAS design wins, we won't be surprised by some quarterly fluctuations. But underneath that, the ADAS business is very strong. It's just kind of a quarterly correction and the rest of the end markets in that segment are flat. We will probably talk a little bit more in May about longer-term trends in audio/video broadcast, but you're right, the industry is facing some headwinds, and we are feeling those as well. Operator And our next question is from the line of Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Hans C. Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc. Thanks. Hey, Moshe, can you give us your feel for your roadmap as you go from 2016 to 2017 and beyond in terms of process technology? And that is in the context of the update that Intel gave the Street a few weeks ago regarding their roadmap and their density advantages. Thank you. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Well, we're delighted to be with TSMC. It's one of the best decisions I've ever made. Maybe professionally, it's the best decision I've ever made. We don't regret it for one minute. They are great. You know, look at everyone who has tried someone else, including Intel. Great company, great manufacturing technology, great CPU provider. The foundry business is a service business. It requires technology leadership. It requires support. It requires an ecosystem. TSMC is second to none, absolutely second to none. I mean, that's sort of really not something I worry about and I'm not in any way understating Intel's capabilities. I'm just sort of saying, as a foundry, I think we're absolutely with the right foundry. What we now uniquely benefit from is, they have such a huge portion of business which comes to them from the wireless smartphones, which in a very, very short period of time enables them to get to incredible defect densities. If you can their investment in capacity, they have for several years now invested $10 billion every year. In terms of access to technology and support technology, in terms of addressing fluctuations, in terms of requirements, they really are best-in-breed. So yes, Intel is great, has great manufacturing capacity. TSMC is by far the best foundry in the business, and they didn't get to having $30 billion worth of foundry business without that sort of excellence. So I'm not at all concerned about access to leading-edge technology. I believe that TSMC can provide us with that and has in the past, is now. If you remember, there was a huge excitement when Altera initially committed to Intel, and the common wisdom would be that they're two years ahead of us. I would say now they're comfortably, and this comes from customers, 18 months behind us. Right. So, we will continue to pursue TSMC and benefit from that relationship. Operator And our next question is from the line of Chris Danely from Citigroup. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hey thanks, guys. Nice job of bringing the OpEx down. Can you just talk about OpEx trends after this quarter? Do you expect it to be at the same percentage of revenues or go up or can you take it down even more? Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Chris, we'll, like all the other questions that relate to longer-term views on the business, we'll talk about that more in our Analyst Meeting. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. But we are committed to, in the longer term, to get back to 30%. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. 30%. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. And higher, right? So, it will hopefully continue moving in the right direction and we'll give more granularity to that in May. Operator And at this time, I'm showing no further audio questions. Presenters, I turn it back to you. Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc. Okay. Thanks for joining us today. We'll have a playback of this call beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time, 8 p.m. Eastern Time today.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Our first question is from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you very much. And, Lorenzo, good to see the accounts receivable come down. That had caused a lot of consternation last quarter. Moshe, I had a question on inferencing. And I know that the investment case for Xilinx is not just on AI and machine learning, but there has been a lot of talk about it and you guys are showing up as well in the inferencing market. So my question is, help us understand some of the benchmarks. And I don't expect you to get into a blog fest with the existing or potential customer, but Google put out a TPU specs against the GPU against the CPU. Where do the FPGAs stack up? Latency, throughput, anything you are willing and able to share will be very helpful. Thank you. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Okay. Well, I'll do my best. But realistically, we're going to provide a lot more information on this topic on May 22. So I encourage you to look for more detail then. But generally speaking, first and foremost, the most valuable element we have is actually in the flexibility, and that is inherent to the programmable logic, and that is something which is very, very, very difficult to provide in an ASIC. And similarly, it's quite difficult to provide in a similar way at least using a CPU and a GPU. And the importance of flexibility is that even though it sort of sounds like machine learning and inferencing and all of that, we are into the 70th year of hearing about it. Reality is it's an emerging technology with very broad applicability where the benchmarks are very dynamic and the ones which are important today are going to be likely totally useless two or three years from now. And the biggest benefit we have is the fact that our devices can be programmed to match the new payloads and new algorithms, right. Now, so that's sort of the generic thing, and I think everyone sort of misses that, and that's why I'm starting with this long semi-diatribe on this issue because that sort of is something that I think the market underestimates the inherent advantage we have there. Now, if you sort of look at a specific set of applications, generally speaking, on things which do not require floating point, we tend to have higher performance and lower power than all other options. Now, if you take one fixed application and you target a dedicated ASIC to it, yes, I'm sure they can do better, but then if anything changes then that ASIC all of a sudden becomes a lot less attractive on the new application, whereas the programmable logic can be modified to adapt to that. And so generally speaking, we have much better performance than CPUs and GPUs for everything except floating point for each application and we have performance which is generally on par to a fixed but actually the biggest benefit is in the flexibility of our products and the fact they can be adapted. With regards to specific benchmarks we can share the numbers we have with you, and we would be happy to do that. And this is one of the reasons that we're so excited about this market. And if you sort of look at Amazon in addition to the inherent technology advantage we provide, it actually provides us with a perfect conduit to a very broad set of new customers. So both in terms of technology and access to the technology, this is a tremendous benefit for us. And we'll talk a little more about that too. I think I've overstayed my welcome on this. Operator And our next question is from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc. John? Operator John, your line is open. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Can you guys hear me now? Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc. Yes. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Yes. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Moshe? Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Yes, we can hear you. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Congratulations on the strong results. I guess, Moshe, my question is pretty simple. Up until about two or three months ago, a lot of our field work was suggesting that, while FPGAs were a great architecture for accelerators in the data center, there were still a lot of software compatibility issues. And I guess we've been fairly impressed over the last three or four months how quickly some of those software issues, programmable issues, have been resolved. So I guess my question to you is, relative to three or even six months ago, how is the acceleration opportunity today versus then? At last year's Analyst Day, I think you talked about $250 million of potential incremental revenue by 2020. I wonder if you'd just give us a sense of whether or not relative to those expectations the acceleration market is actually accelerating? And I apologize for the pun. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Okay. So you're right. Last year, at our Analyst Day, we projected it to be between $200 million to 300 million in the calendar year 2020 timeframe. At the time we gave those projections, we were aware of the engagement with Amazon, but we were unaware of what they were planning on doing with it. And so for us, we have lots of customers. And actually all of the big hyperscalers are customers, but they don't always initially share what their plans are. What has happened over the past year, and in particular with Amazon, and that became clear only at the tail end of the calendar year, so I think it was November at the very earliest that we sort of found out what it is that they wanted to do. We also detected that in order to make them successful, we needed to prioritize the software environment, which was something we were working on, but was probably at least a year away. We identified that that needed to be raised in terms of priority, and a lot of resource was put in place. Now, they've moved very, very quickly. We have been delighted to support them with their very significant requirements, and at the beginning of the calendar year, they actually opened it up to limited release, and the limited release enabled FPGA experts to access the technology. So the technology became available in the cloud, but it was available to a limited set of customers. And when they announced general availability, then that's a much broader set of customers. So the change is that Amazon has now legitimized this, is putting it in the cloud. The software, which was clearly a handicap we had, we have invested very heavily and now the results the customers are seeing are very positive, and there's a follow-up release less than a month from now which will even broaden the target customer base even more significantly than it does. Now, the underlying question is how much can this do for revenue, and I think it's still too early to predict that. Clearly, the potential is there for it either to be larger or for it to happen a little earlier. It's still unlikely to impact the next 18 months in a significant way, but it is possible that by 2020, if this goes well, that the market could be larger than what we said, and this is for our technology, or it could maybe happen faster in 2019. But what we're really trying to do is, we don't want to sort of generate any short-term frostiness because there really is not the proof in terms of deployment to justify that. There is the potential of that happening in a little further-out timeframe than what I think most people are looking at. And so there is goodness and there is goodness in the technology. There is goodness in the opportunity, and there is definitely tremendous potential with Amazon putting this up in the cloud and making it available to everyone broadly. And they were very clear. You can look at their blog. They sort of said this is initially being deployed in one location. If that is successful, then the implication there is that there could be significant deployment in other locations, which in of itself would be an accelerator or a potential enhancer of the business. But that first deployment needs to be successful. And obviously both Amazon and Xilinx are working hand in hand to do the best we can to support it. Operator And our next question is from the line of Tristan Gerra from Robert W. Baird. Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hi. Good afternoon. Similar question in the ADAS business. How should we look at this business medium term for Xilinx? You've mentioned a high 20s market share in the past. Do you think that there is a trend where FPGAs can actually gain share against ASIC in that market? And we know the product cycles are very long. And is programmability as critical as it is in the other market that you just discussed? Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Well, the programmability and the flexibility is valuable in this market, because this again is a market which is in flux. It is changing rapidly. What we are now deployed in is ADAS. We have a lot of design wins in advanced ADAS. Those put us in a good position to transition into the automated or autonomous driving over time. We think that this is a process which, until it really becomes mainstream and very, very broadly deployed, it has a 10 to a 15-year horizon until that sort of happens. And at that point in time, it wouldn't surprise me if it becomes significantly commoditized. But until it gets to that point, we do believe that the programmability is a major asset that we have. And this is a market we identified early, and we think that for the next two generations of deployments over the next five to seven years, we're in a very good position. And our market share should grow a lot of the growth this current quarter in our automotive numbers, which hit a new record were due to a surge in ADAS. And we'll give more data with regards to our overall practical businesses in May, but you can be sure that automotive is likely to be the highest growing or amongst the highest growing markets for our next year projections. Next question, please. Operator And our next question is from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the Zynq being over 10% of revenues. I was kind of excited about that. Can you just talk a little bit about what the drivers are? And you've talked about the number of design wins that you have in Zynq, the mountain of design wins, I think you've referred to it as. Where are we in terms of monetizing that and how much do you think, how long do you think that you can grow at the rate that you have been in that Zynq product? Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Well, if you look at the Zynq products offering, it was introduced at the tail end of our 28-nanometer, so I believe the first tape-out was at the end of 2011 for Zynq. And then silicon was probably available a year later, and we got a lot of design wins in three initial markets which it was targeted at were wireless, and it was won a lot of business in wireless. Actually it's at the core of our wireless strategy. Most of the deployment that you're seeing now in wireless at Xilinx or a lot of it is Zynq-based. Second area, and this was a major driver for the definition of the product, was automotive, and that's a market that takes quite a bit longer, but is now hitting its stride. And the third is industrial control, and that's where we have the proverbial mountain of design wins, which are now starting to turn to revenue, and that's just a function of how long it takes. What we're seeing in parallel is a second generation Zynq that was targeted at the high and mid range of the market at 16-nanometer, but what we've done is we've since taken the 28 nanometer and expanded it down to lower-end devices. So, you can tell from that that we expect it to be a big driver going forward and at 7-nanometer it's going to be part and parcel of a broad deployment in our technology, because we believe that at that point, 7-nanometer, it's going to be an integration play. And nearly all of our customers will use the high-performance multi-CPU cores, which are part of that in their technology. So, if you sort of look at it, it's grown from 0% to 10% of our business. And my expectation is that it can grow from 10% to 20% much faster than it took to grow to 10%. And maybe we'll try and quantify how much faster, but it's now no longer a new wonder. And just the repeat business that we can get in of itself should be a major driver in addition to the expansion that we have. And if you go far enough into the future, it's likely that close to 100% of our business over time will be driven by the Zynq product offering. But that's probably 10 years out. That's probably not now. Operator And our next question is from the line of C.G. (sic) [C.J.] (27:23) Muse from Evercore. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess the question here is you guided comm and data center up sequentially. Curious if you could talk about what you've embedded in the guide for incremental growth from the data center. And then as a quick housekeeping question, if you could offer your outlook for share count for the June quarter. Thanks so much. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Yeah. So two things. So I might frustrate you by not being very precise. But in the comms, we do show data center. We do expect data center to grow meaningfully. And again that's in the context of some of our older data center business not growing as much as we would like. And in certain cases, our design wins that we've had were slowing down. So we do think that, in summary, that the data center growth, which is part of the overall comms growth, all the end other markets in the comms area we expect to be growing as well, but the data center growth will be driven by hyperscale. Then with regard to share count, so I haven't been providing detailed share count guidance for the past couple of quarters for a couple reasons. One is I don't want to kind of signal exactly what we're doing on our buyback. And the second part is, the complexity of the convert and its impact on our diluted share count is hard to describe briefly. So I would though recommend you, CJ, go to our website. We're going to update what we expect to be the impact on diluted share count from the redemption of the convert in this quarter. Like I said, it's fairly complex, but we've tried to make it understandable. And you will see that it will have a significant impact in this current fiscal quarter, and then because of the way the accounting is done for the share count, it will actually even translate to a further reduction in the next quarter. So I mean, I will actually, I'm happy to take a follow-up if there's something specifically you were looking for, but I'm not going to give you a precise share count guide. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC No, that's very helpful. Thanks so much. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Yeah. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Thank you. Next question. Operator Our next question is from the line of John Vinh from Pacific Crest. John N. Vinh - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Question on 5G. I think you guys have talked about your 5G trial win rate at roughly 9% plus. Also if you think about 5G as versus 4G, you've got a 3x to 5x increase in radio heads, which is an area that you historically have done extremely well. And you've also announced the RF SoC, which gives you an opportunity to expand your footprint because it integrates additional discretes. So, I was wondering if you could just put into context, how do we think about the 5G opportunity versus 4G. Right, and conceptually it sounds like a very sizable opportunity, but I'm just wondering if you could also just talk about what are the other offsets that we should be thinking about. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Okay. So great questions, actually. There's a whole series of very detailed questions. So we will try and give you more clarity on that in May, but let me give you Reader's Digest. The broad deployment of 5G is expected to start in earnest in 2020 and we believe we're going to have a very good position there based on the design wins we have. It is indeed quite likely that at least on the radio head side there will be a larger number than was done, you know, than were deployed in 4G. And fundamentally 5G is going to be essential in terms of enabling the infrastructure or a whole host of things which are extremely visible today, like this entire industrial IoT. To do that well, the 5G technology is going to be a key enabler there. So we absolutely agree that the potential is larger. Our technology position is very strong. We think that between now and 2020, there is going to be ongoing deployment for 4G, including there is going to be additional rounds even in China, which is now the tail end of I think the fifth round of LTE deployment. And they will do a sixth round that is expected to be about two-thirds of the size of the fifth round, but that's still a very significant number. India is going strong, and there is other countries in the world where there is deployment. So if you look at the overall wireless business, we expect it to hover around the mid-point of, for us, our high was close to $150 million a quarter. Our low was $75 million. We expect to hover around the midpoint over the next few years on average until the 5G starts in earnest. Our technology position makes us very confident that during these next two years, all of the pre-5G deployment is likely to benefit us. And then when the real thing starts, then that's when you could see it approaching or maybe even surpassing the previous levels. But that's a few years away in terms of hitting over $150 million per quarter. We don't see that happening any time soon. Hope that answers your question, and we'll try and give more visibility into that in May. Operator And our next question is from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Moshe, I'm wondering, as we head into the Analyst Day, in order to prepare for it, what should we be thinking about sort of the puts and takes that could take your top line above or below this year's roughly 6% growth? Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Well, we'll give you an annual projection. And we're delighted that we have, if you look at one year, we have 100% hit rate in terms of hitting that number. If you look back more than one year, we have a very low hit rate. And we're very proud of actually delivering the 6% on the nose and actually just exceeding that. But we will provide you with guidance. I think the thing that gets overlooked and despite the fact that we emphasize it again and again and again is, we benefit immensely from the multimarket portion, and that sort of provides us with a lot less volatility than most other players. And what we'll try to do is to highlight which of these markets are likely to, or have the potential of doing better, which are just likely to hit the natural growth rate and which some of them, for better or for worse are below the growth rate. And we'll sort of highlight those, but there are sort of eight disparate markets and they all tend to have somewhat different dynamics. The ones which get the sexiest and get the most air time are data center and automotive, but we're actually doing very well on A&D. We're doing very well on test and measurement. We've done better than most other semiconductor or all other semiconductor companies on wireless, in a time where the wireless industry has not done well. So, I think the under-appreciated part is the multimarket portion. And if I have a request is that you'll come with some openness with regards to hearing about the other markets, even if they're less, have less curb appeal than the ones everyone is talking about. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. That was a very artfully phrased question, too. Good for that. Operator And our next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea of what you expect 16-nanometer revenues might be in the current fiscal year, fiscal 2018? Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. We will give you guidelines for that in May. It's too early, but it's done great, and a lot of that is driven by the Amazon deployment, but it's not all of it. There's actually, you can just tell from the number of customers in the number of markets we're in that it's doing better. It's actually getting deployed faster than any other technology we have seen in the past and we're also benefiting from a very favorable competitive position. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay, great. And for my follow-up, can you give us any idea of whether you're seeing any pickup in defense, in sales into the defense segment? Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Well, there was a nice pickup this quarter. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. It's generally been on an upward trend as design wins that we have, one in our 28-nanometer generation ramp in. As you know, in defense, it's a very, very long-tailed business. So at any point one time, we have multiple generations, multiple of our product generations being sold into the industry. So given our competitive position and strength of design wins and our continued design wins in large opportunities like Joint Strike Fighter, we feel very good about the business. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. It's already the third largest. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Largest business. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Market we're in, and it's not that far away from wired and wireless. Smaller than wired and wireless, but it's approaching those numbers. Operator Our next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to circle back to the AWS announcement, just kind of the concept of FPGAs as a service, or available in the cloud. And kind of what size of consumers do you think would use this, whether you'd see any larger scale customers deploy it, or is this more for smaller? And then you can you just talk about competitive landscape there, if you expect you'd be the only offering or if you would see any from Altera as well? Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. So there's seven big players, and we are talking to all seven of them. The one which has the largest existing deployment is Microsoft, and that is using the Intel slash Altera for that. We believe we have a product which is so much better than that, that obviously that is at the core of our success with all of the players. With regards to the breadth of the usage, the beauty of this is, in particular in the Amazon case, is that this enables a broad new set of applications to evolve in a way which the traditional way of pursuing the business was just not capable of doing. And it is inherent to the Amazon model that they don't actually know themselves yet, because they don't have the end system expertise. They're not experts in all of these areas. What they do and what they are experts at monetizing is making it easy to use and making it available and then enabling an amazing ecosystem where the players use it. And what we are seeing and just they talked about thousands of customers applying from the very first minute, several hundreds getting access during the limited release and then being open to the potentially thousands of customers in the general availability. Our expectation is as this unfolds, and that's why we're being cagey on providing numbers, right. That's sort of what we're trying to – we believe this could have a viral impact and not only would it be used in a public cloud sort of applications like Amazon, but when people start seeing the benefits of that, they'll just think that even for their specific applications, they could see huge improvements. And as this transition is happening into a world where machine learning is becoming broadly used for a whole host of applications, that these sort of open up and hence there's huge potential there. Also, that's the reason that we are loath to try to quantify it yet. But yet, all of this change is quite a monumental one in terms of accessibility, in terms of ease of use, and the breadth of the benefits and the benefit of the programmability, because there are some misguided notions that an ASIC by definition is better than an FPGA. This is the one set of applications which an ASIC, due to the fact that it takes years to design and it's very rigid, you could do a wonderful job designing absolutely the wrong ASIC, and then deploy it at a time where the market has changed, whereas if you use programmable logic, you can change it in situ, in live applications and it can adapt to these new applications and benchmarks, so hence the benefits. The other benefit is that a lot of these applications, in particular on the inference side tend to have more of a integer nature to them as opposed to the traditional floating point applications. And as a result, and it's sometimes it's a flexible integer format that they use, and there is nothing more flexible or better than programmable logic in terms of doing that. So I know I haven't quite answered your question, but I think that's the potential. Lorenzo, also? Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Yeah. So I think an element of your question, Blayne, was maybe related to whether the applications on AWS are kind of nichy or small or whether there's some big entities using it. And the launch partners range obviously from some smaller entities to some very large entities, and they're doing a range of applications that are fundamental to each of the companies in the core businesses. So I do think the scaling opportunity is there and very well represented. Operator And our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Just one near-term question. The guidance for the June quarter for industrial, aerospace and defense being flat and then down in the broadcast, consumer and auto segment, could you give a little bit more color about the moving parts in that? And then maybe a slightly longer-term aspect of it, I know you said that automotive would be a fast grower, and you'll give us more details at the Analyst Meeting in May. But the other part of that equation, the broadcast and consumer, has been a bit of a headwind for a couple of years. So I just wondered what the trajectory of that might be over the course of the year. Thanks. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Yeah. So the industrial A&D softness is due to program-specific things in defense primarily. The rest of the business areas are relatively going to be flat relatively quarter on quarter. In the automotive, consumer, broadcast space, as we've mentioned in this call already, we've set a record in automotive. And if you go back a quarter, we talked about kind of a low based on some inventory things. So we're going to see a little bit of dip in automotive. And by the way, though we expect a longer-term trend upward based on the strength of our ADAS design wins, we won't be surprised by some quarterly fluctuations. But underneath that, the ADAS business is very strong. It's just kind of a quarterly correction and the rest of the end markets in that segment are flat. We will probably talk a little bit more in May about longer-term trends in audio/video broadcast, but you're right, the industry is facing some headwinds, and we are feeling those as well. Operator And our next question is from the line of Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities. Hans C. Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc. Thanks. Hey, Moshe, can you give us your feel for your roadmap as you go from 2016 to 2017 and beyond in terms of process technology? And that is in the context of the update that Intel gave the Street a few weeks ago regarding their roadmap and their density advantages. Thank you. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. Well, we're delighted to be with TSMC. It's one of the best decisions I've ever made. Maybe professionally, it's the best decision I've ever made. We don't regret it for one minute. They are great. You know, look at everyone who has tried someone else, including Intel. Great company, great manufacturing technology, great CPU provider. The foundry business is a service business. It requires technology leadership. It requires support. It requires an ecosystem. TSMC is second to none, absolutely second to none. I mean, that's sort of really not something I worry about and I'm not in any way understating Intel's capabilities. I'm just sort of saying, as a foundry, I think we're absolutely with the right foundry. What we now uniquely benefit from is, they have such a huge portion of business which comes to them from the wireless smartphones, which in a very, very short period of time enables them to get to incredible defect densities. If you can their investment in capacity, they have for several years now invested $10 billion every year. In terms of access to technology and support technology, in terms of addressing fluctuations, in terms of requirements, they really are best-in-breed. So yes, Intel is great, has great manufacturing capacity. TSMC is by far the best foundry in the business, and they didn't get to having $30 billion worth of foundry business without that sort of excellence. So I'm not at all concerned about access to leading-edge technology. I believe that TSMC can provide us with that and has in the past, is now. If you remember, there was a huge excitement when Altera initially committed to Intel, and the common wisdom would be that they're two years ahead of us. I would say now they're comfortably, and this comes from customers, 18 months behind us. Right. So, we will continue to pursue TSMC and benefit from that relationship. Operator And our next question is from the line of Chris Danely from Citigroup. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hey thanks, guys. Nice job of bringing the OpEx down. Can you just talk about OpEx trends after this quarter? Do you expect it to be at the same percentage of revenues or go up or can you take it down even more? Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. Chris, we'll, like all the other questions that relate to longer-term views on the business, we'll talk about that more in our Analyst Meeting. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. But we are committed to, in the longer term, to get back to 30%. Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc. 30%. Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc. And higher, right? So, it will hopefully continue moving in the right direction and we'll give more granularity to that in May. Operator And at this time, I'm showing no further audio questions. Presenters, I turn it back to you. Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc. Okay. Thanks for joining us today. We'll have a playback of this call beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time, 8 p.m. Eastern Time today. For a copy of our earnings release, please visit our Investor Relations website. Our next earnings release date for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 will be Wednesday, July 26, after the market close. We'll be hosting our Analyst Meeting in New York City on May 22.

At time time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After management’s prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Today’s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today’s conference, Ruiyu Li. Ruiyu Li Thank you, operator, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today are Richard Liu, CEO of JD.com; and Sidney Huang, our CFO. For today’s agenda, Mr. Huang will discuss highlights for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016. Following their prepared remarks, Mr. Liu and Mr. Huang will answer your questions. Before we continue, I refer you to our Safe Harbor statement in the earnings press release, which applies to this call as we will make forward-looking statements. Also, this call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our earnings release, which contains a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures. Finally, please note that unless otherwise stated, all the figures mentioned during this conference call are in RMB. Now, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Sidney. Sidney Huang Thank you, Ruiyu, and hello, everyone. We are delighted to report another outstanding quarter of accelerating revenue growth and the record non-GAAP net profit. Our net revenue grew 47% in Q4 2016. Thanks to our highly successful shopping events in November and the December holiday seasons. Our direct sales revenues grew 46% in the fourth quarter, the highest since Q4 2015, led by home furnishing, food and beverage, home appliance, and baby products. Revenues from services and others increased 58% year-over-year, supported by higher advertising revenue, as well as income from financial services, which after eliminating inter-segment revenue surpassed 1% of our total quarterly net revenues for the first time in Q4 2016. Our GMV, excluding virtual items grew 50% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. GMV from general merchandise categories, excluding virtual items grew 59% during the quarter. Food and beverage, home furnishing, cosmetics and the baby products were the fastest growing general merchandise categories, with apparel and footwear remained the largest category with a solid growth momentum. As a percent of the total, general merchandise GMV contributed 52.4%, another record high level for JD Mall. GMV from electronics and home appliance products grew 42% during the quarter, led by the home appliance category. The non-GAAP gross profit increased by 58% in the fourth quarter, further demonstrating the healthy monetization of both our 1P and 3P businesses. Non-GAAP gross margin improved to 15%, up from 14% a year ago, reflecting continued gross margin expansion in our first-party business, due to increased economies of scale across all key categories. Gross margin on direct sales revenue again improved over 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis in Q4 2016. Non-GAAP fulfillment expense ratio was 7.5% in Q4 compared to 8.2% in the same quarter last year. The lower fulfillment expense ratio was mainly due to a higher base in Q4 2015, as we started to move aggressively into the consumable product category. A second factor affecting the fulfillment expense ratio was the exceptional sequential growth in the seasonally strong fourth quarter, which drove down our average fulfillment expense per order. As a result of the stronger seasonal effect and exceptional performance in Q4, all other non-GAAP operating expense ratios also saw improvement on a year-over-year basis. This is likely a one-time event in the near-term, but provides a good indication for potential operating leverage in the medium to long-term. The non-GAAP operating margin was 0.6% in the fourth quarter, compared to a non-GAAP operating loss in the same quarter last year. Excluding the new businesses, our core JD Mall operations had an operating margin of 0.8% on a non-GAAP basis, with an improvement of over 70 basis points over the same period last year, mainly driven by the higher gross margin. Our non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders reached a new record of RMB566 million, with a net margin of 0.7% in the fourth quarter. The non-GAAP EBITDA also set another record at RMB1.1 billion, with an EBITDA margin of 1.3%. For full-year 2016, our non-GAAP net margin was 0.4% and the non-GAAP EBITDA margin was 1.1%. Our free cash flow remained strong. For the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2016, free cash flow totaled RMB15.6 billion, up 121% from the previous training 12 months. Now I would like to update you the progress of the JD Finance Reorganization. As disclosed in our earnings release, we just signed the definitive agreements yesterday with a group of domestic investors after receiving approval from our Independent Audit Committee and the Board of Directors for the reorganization plan. Under the agreements, JD.com will dispose its remaining 68.6% equity stake in JD Finance in exchange for RMB14.3 billion in cash and 40% of the pre-tax profits of JD Finance after it achieves cumulative profitability in the future. We will also have the option to convert 40% profit sharing right back into JD Finance equity when it’s permitted by the applicable regulations. As part of the transaction, Richard Liu, our Chairman and CEO. will acquire a 4.3% equity stake in JD Finance and will obtain the majority voting rights in the entity through his equity stake and voting proxy with other investors and ESOP participants. We’re very pleased with the terms of the agreements. In addition to the strategic objectives I mentioned on our last earnings call, upon the transaction closing, JD.com will receive RMB14.3 billion, or US$2.1 billion in cash, which will be a tremendous financial gain over the – RMB2.1 billion of capital that we have invested in JD Finance. As JD.com and in JD Finance will be both on the voting control of Richard after this transaction. From the accounting perspective, the deal will be accounted for as an under common control transaction, with economic gain recorded directly in the equity section of the financial statements without any impact on the P&L. Nevertheless, this is a real economic gain to our shareholders, which effectively more than offset the total GAAP losses over the past two years. In addition, the 40% profit sharing right does not bear any downside risks associated with the JD Finance business. But it does allow our shareholders to continue enjoying 40% of its potential upside. Therefore, from a valuation perspective, the 40% profit sharing right is actually more valuable than a 40% straight equity interest. For many TMT and consumer-focused investors, the transaction can also remove the complexity and perceive the risks associated with a financial services company. So you can better evaluate the core e-commerce and the related businesses. Finally, let’s discuss our financial outlook. We expect Q1 net revenue growth to be between 34% and 38% on a year-over-year basis. This guidance reflects our solid growth momentum for seasonally slow quarter. For the non-GAAP net income, we expect an overall non-GAAP net margin between break-even and a positive 1% for the full-year 2017, assuming JD Finance will be deconsolidated in the second-half of this year and the new data equity loss pickup is maintained at its current run rate. This guidance reflects our continued focus on the growth of our business and our commitment to gradually improving the operating margin, while still maintaining sufficient flexibility to invest and compete in this highly dynamic sector. This concludes my prepared remarks. And we can now move to the Q&A section – session. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. The question-and-answer session of this conference call will start in a moment. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung of Merrill Lynch. Please ask your questions. Eddie Leung Good evening. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on a very solid quarter. Just real two quick questions. The first one is about your marketing business. Could you give us an update on the progress of your marketing business about your marketplace? Are we seeing the propositioned to your marketplace and others revenues going up from this business model? And then secondly, just some clarification on some recent news about expansion into offline stores in the rural areas. Anymore collar would be helpful? Thank you. Sidney Huang Okay. Eddie, I assume you’re asking about adverting business on the other revenues. So we have definitely seen our advertising business growing at a faster pace than our overall revenue growth. However, we have also refrained from aggressively monetizing at the expense – of the user experience. So our growth in our advertising program with merchant and suppliers is definitely moving ahead at a faster speed, but at the same time at a very – it’s quite a measured pace. So for the second question on offline stores, I assume, you’re asking about our franchised stores that we just recently announced. It will be an extension of our real program. It’s not really for JD to setting up physical stores, but we will work with local businesses to set up a franchise small stores. It’s a one level actually below our Jingdong Mall business model, which is at the county level. And the 10,000 stores that we mentioned is really working with villages at one level below the county level. So we can reach to broader consumers in the rural area. But it’s actually a asset-light business model. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please ask your questions. Alicia Yap Hi, thank you. Good evening, Richard, Sidney, and Ruiyu. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong results. My question is related to your gross margins. So as you’re seeing there are some – despite a year-over-year is an increase, but on the sequential base, it’s actually a decline. And it also seems like on the 1P margins itself sequentially seems to be about 70 basis points decline. So is that mainly because of the FMCG categories being bigger, or is it related to the seasonal aggressive promotional discount. And related to that is that how much are we targeting to spend on the sales and marketing to promote Yihaodian and also the FMCG category, and when will this category to achieve a break-even target? Thank you. Sidney Huang Sure, Alicia. So on the gross margin, you’re right that normally in Q2 and Q4, we will – during those major promotion events, gross margin tend to be slightly lower than the first quarter and the third quarter. So that’s the reason. So that’s why we always look at the gross margin trend on a year-over-year basis, which is more apples-to-apples. For the Yihaodian business, we continued to invest as part of our broader FMCG effort. And we have encouragingly see that from our own business. That is – the margin has been moving in the right direction, despite of the massive active – promotional activities that we are running during the fourth quarter, which is seeing a very, very encouraging results. The reason for that is really because of the scale of economies, as I mentioned earlier. The gross margin have seen meaningful improvement. And at the same time, we’re also optimizing our fulfillment infrastructure and also on the order economics driven by, for example, minimal order size required for free delivery. So we have seen – beginning to see a very meaningful improvement in both growth and order economics for the consumer product category. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please ask your question. Alex Yao Hi, good morning. Sorry, good morning and good evening, everyone. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the solid quarter. Two quick ones. One is regarding the strong top line growth momentum, particularly for Q1, which is a usually assume the weak quarter for you guys. Can you talk about what’s driving our revenue momentum there? And then secondly, just want to clarify that your 2017 net margin guidance is between 0% to 1% that included data loss pickup, which is about RMB1.4 billion this quarter. So assuming annualized RMB6 billion loss, you still expect it to be profitable next year, I’m sorry, this year? Sidney Huang Right. So on the first quarter revenue guidance, we do see the seasonal slowdown in growth rate. I guess, you’re comparing our growth rate to perhaps other industry players. From our perspective, we always strive to grow much faster than the industry average. So the current growth rate in our mind is, we hope it will be even stronger. So to us, this is only – we hope the – at a comfortable base and we can – we saw internal effort. We can outperform. For the 2017 net margin guidance, I know don’t know how you get to the RMB1.5 billion new data loss. The – as I mentioned in the past, you should assume about RMB100 million monthly run rate in losses – in loss pickup from new data. So that would be to round it, I’m referring to. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please ask your question. Alan Hellawell Great. Thank you very much. Just quickly, now that we have moved through a near calendar year of anti-brushing and decline in the sale of virtual items. Given that it’s now really a mirror [ph]. I was wondering if you could quantify how much of a tailwind this translates in 2017 for us? And also would just love a little more color around the free cash flow turning negative, increase in inventory that is in the fourth quarter, and what we might take on Board, as it relates to 2017? Thank you. Sidney Huang So, Alan, so for our GMV growth in 2017 by the second quarter basically will have the enhanced anti-brushing efforts that we announced last year. So all else being equal, you will see a more normalized growth rate. I can’t promise you for an acceleration, but at least by that time, it will be more apples-to-apples. We continue to work very hard to improve the quality of the products we list through our marketplace. So that ongoing effort we hope will pay off and both our customers and the quality merchants will benefit. On the free cash flow, as I mentioned Yihaodian my previous earnings call that there were some seasonal timing effect in Q3. So by Q4, we effectively those burst that timing difference. And again, when – for cash flow, because you could easily make some impact at quarter-end. So anything go quarter, cash flow will not reflect your ongoing cash flow momentum. So that’s why we always like to use the trailing 12 months as a better metric to measure free cash flow. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang of HSBC. Please ask your question. Chi Tsang Hi, good evening. Thank you very much for taking my question, and congrats on the nice set of results. I was just wondering if you can give us an update on sort of how Yihaodian is going both from a sort of a 1P and a 3P perspective? Thank you. Sidney Huang Right. So, as we mentioned in the last quarter actually beginning November 1, we took over the first-party business, while still utilizing the Yihaodian entity and its key to run the procurement for us. So it – the business has been very healthy. We see healthy growth on a year-over-year basis and it also contributed roughly RMB1.8 billion in the third – in the fourth quarter during those two months. So it’s a very healthy business and we look to further innovate utilizing this separate e-commerce platform. And we will, by the time the plan is finalized, we will announce to the market. So we will have a new position – positioning for Yihaodian to better serve the local communities. But in terms of category focus, it will continue to be focused on the FMCG and food and beverage categories. Operator [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Jin Yoon of Mizuho Securities. Please ask your question. Jin Yoon Hi, good evening. On the US$2.1 billion that you’re going to receive, is that going to come in stages, or should we expect that one payment – one lump sum payment? And second of all with that, is there a spending horizon for that cash flow you’re going to see, any CapEx cycle that we may see going forward? Thanks. Sidney Huang So, the RMB14.3 billion – oh, yes, you mean, US$2.1 billion, yes, we will receive that in a lump sum payment upon closing. So, we should expect to receive that in the middle of 2017. We have not have any specific use of the proceeds. But part of our ongoing investment, there will be CapEx requirement this year. I did mention last time that CapEx for 2016 was artificially low. Some of the projects were delayed due to the local land readiness. So you will see higher CapEx in 2017. But it will be covered by our operating cash flow in any event. Now the additional cash proceeds that we got from this transaction, obviously, we can also use it for strategic investments in our ecosystem and other general corporate purpose that we deemed appropriate. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Keung of Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question. Ronald Keung Thank you for taking my questions, and thank you Sidney. Just a question on the supermarket initiatives. Do you have any further cooperations or strategic plans with Walmart and Yonghui many across supply chain sourcing and O2O this year? Thank you. Sidney Huang Sure. Yes, so we have developed – we have a very healthy relationship with those two strategic partners, in particular, our new data entity is forming a closer partnership with those two companies. We disclosed that number first that are linked to our new data – Jingdong data platform. And in particular, increasingly, we have established separate picking centers in those stores. So that when a customer place an order, the items can be very quickly packaged and delivered. So, at – for JD [indiscernible] program, the current commitment is delivering within two hours. But if you look at the actual – in most of the stores, the delivery time is actually now down to about one hour. So the customer service level has been continuously improving with the closer partnership with those two supermarket partners. They are also potential – other potential collaborations, which is yet to be announced. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ming Zhao of 86Research. Please ask your question. Your line is now open. Ming Zhao from 86Research. Please ask your question. Ming Zhao Yes. So my question is, the JD Finance is spun-off from the company. But JD is generating a lot of cash, so for a lot of retail companies, the free cash flow is plenty and they use that to do investment and generate returns. So if JD Finance is spun-off, what can JD do to generate returns from those cash flows you generated? What’s a business model for that free cash flow generation? Thank you. Sidney Huang Right. So that’s an interesting question. In fact, even before we spin-off JD Finance, we had committed to the market that JD Finance starting 2016 would be self-funded. So we actually get in use JD.com’s free cash flow to fund JD Finance. We disclosed in the cash flow section of our earnings release the total cash inflow and cash outflow for JD Finance business and you can see that inflow actually was higher than outflow during the year. So that has been out philosophy that the Finance business should be independently run. JD.com has not either subsidized or deployed our capital to support the business beyond the initial investment. I actually mentioned about RMB2.1 billion that was the capital that we invested. On top of that, we did have a line of credit to JD Finance. That’s capped at around RMB10 billion. And that line of credit is still available. But as you can see in last year, that line of credit did not move up. And so that’s basically our separation of risk between JD.com and JD finance. So as far as the free cash flow, we do have actually many investment opportunities for the e-commerce ecosystem. So this – we’ve been very active in discussing strategic partnership with many of the potential partners either retail or on the product side. And we expect more of those investment opportunities to come up. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou of Credit Suisse. Please ask your questions. Evan Zhou Hi, good evening, Sidney. Thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on a very strong quarter. The question is regarding our FMCG category growth. I think couple of days ago we kind of announced that we have roughly like RMB100 billion of GMV in the quality finance for an FMCG category for this year. Is that a number that we can kind of reference our expectation on what is here? And also in terms of the contribution from the loss or in terms of the margin drag from the FMCG segment or JD supermarket, could you kind of provide some color to quantify that for this year? Thank you. Sidney Huang Sure, yes, I think the RMB100 billion is a three-year target, not for this year, okay. Yes, so this is obviously announced by our business unit. And it should be a number that’s pretty comfortably achievable. On the margin profile it is, as I mentioned earlier, we do see a trend of improving operating margin and narrowing operating loss for that business which is driven by both expanding gross margin due to the economies of scale. And also improving order economics through higher ticket size and a more efficient fulfillment. So it is definitely improving, but at the same time this remains the last major category that’s money losing. And we do believe because the characteristics of this unique category, it is worthwhile for us to continue to invest in this category at least in the next two years. And there will be obviously profitability potential for this business. Again, both from further improvement in the gross margin and also on order economics. Operator The next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please ask your question. Natalie Wu Hi, good evening Sydney, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very solid quarter. So my question is regarding – actually the average order size, it seems to be like stabilizing in fourth quarter? Also the fulfillment cost per order stabilizing as well. So just wondering if it’s mainly due to a seasonality phenomenon or should we expect the change to carry on in this year? Sidney Huang It’s actually both, so for normally in [Audio Gap] we see somewhat higher average order size because of the promotional events. But also for certain category, as I mentioned about FMCG, some of the new policies will actually tie the consumers to the ticket size gradually. So that trend will continue, we hope. But on the other hand, because the low ticket sized categories like FMCG and apparel and home furnishing are growing faster than the electronics and home appliance categories. So on a blended basis, you may not see average ticket size improving every quarter. So there is these two forces in getting to a blended average. Richard Liu Hello everyone, this is Richard speaking. I will try my best to speak English, but it will come out maybe really will be happy to offline later, calculate on my English to you all. I know a lot of the investors care about our FMCG category and also a lot of competitors gave a lot of rumors on the market. They said, look at me, I made so much money if I only return a little bit of my money and I take Jingdong to be our price war, say, would never ever been possible, we will buy sooner or later. If that’s wrong, I can give you two points. First one is, Yamato, our supplier, we have margin protection items, instead Jingdong will remain the lowest priced. If any competitor reduces the price, we have our rights to reduce our price on the same time, on the same level, but we’re a supplier, we’ll give out the same gross margin. So we’re not losing any money. To be honest sometime it starts to impact our gross margin a little bit because on the same time we’re not only reducing our price, we also give a huge coupon. We’ll give a lot of coupon to our customers, it’s our money, but not a significant impaction, just only a little bit. And second, actually a price war is very good of our company. I can give you two examples, first one is about books in 2009. We got into a price war with Jingdong in books category. And so after six years later I can tell you, last year, the books category has been profitable by quarterly. And in 2012 we also launched a price war with SUI [ph] about the larger home appliance. One day they lost a huge money because at that time we had no margin protection item at that time with our money. One day we lost RMB100 million and I’m sure every investor was quite on that night. But five years later, we’re currently number one, the largest today in China, both online and offline. And it has been profitable for some years. Today we’re also in our price war on FMCG category. But always the price war is the best news for us. I will recommend my shareholder any time like we had some price war with Jingdong, you should open a La curate brand of Champagne for that. Because it means sooner or later we will be number one and it will be profitable, it can make a lot of money for our shareholders. So let’s make it simple, no loss no wins, no profit and no worry. Thank you. Operator Your next question from the line of Wendy Huang of Macquarie, please ask your question. Wendy Huang Thank you. So you mentioned that if you – once you convert the profit sharing 40% to equity ownership, there are some regulatory approval you need to go through. So can you give some detail on what kind of the government approval that you need to obtain in order to achieve that? Also you mentioned that you will get the profit sharing only after the company actually will achieve the cumulative profit. So what is the cumulative loss as of now? Thank you. Sidney Huang So if we keep in mind that the spin-off, in the first place, is done to facilitate JD Finance to, one, to apply for certain licenses for them for the securities license that will require strict domestic shareholder base. And second, the methods of shareholding structure will facilitate a future domestic listing. So for those two areas as of now the regulation will not permit us to convert the 40% profit sharing right back into equity. However, in the future, should the regulations become and offset – regulations change in those two areas for example, then clearly we would have the option to convert back into equity. We have – on your second question, we have not disclosed our cumulative losses. We will, however, disclose more segment information in our annual report, where you will see, at least, the operating losses for our new business lines, which will give you a fairly good idea on the JD Finance profile. It is a private company, so we are not disclosing the exact loss amount at this point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Choi of Daiwa. Please ask your question. John Choi Good evening and good morning and thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a great set of results. I have a couple questions here. Sidney, I was wondering if you could kind of clarify or give more color on the strategic reinvestment that you mentioned that you said, given that JD Finance is now being officially spun-off and it’s taking investment return products et cetera. I was wondering what kind of areas and how big kind of investments, because I’m thinking of and how we should think over the longer term? And the second question is in your fulfillment area. I mean, if you look at the fulfillment, we are seeing nice operating leverage, but as you can see recently, a lot of the third-party logistics providers have been coming to the market with IPO. We’ve heard a lot of aggressive investment plans from them. So is JD required to a further step-up in investment and you know in order to compete or maintain its competitive advantage versus these players and should we thinking about additional CapEx related to this? Thank you. Sidney Huang So for investment, we always maintained that all of our investments will be strategic and we are very focused to invest in the ecosystem around our e-commerce business and also on the new technologies. So, as we also mentioned in our earnings release that we had actually laid out next obvious strategic plan to invest further into the technologies, in particular, in artificial intelligence and Big Data for example, so some of the investments will potentially be invested in these technology areas. So – but they will all be very much related to our core business. On your second question, we addressed this before that and our logistic network is actually quite different from certainly that, which is purely a delivery company. So for us, we – it’s an integrated warehousing network and last mile delivery, which is very unique for an e-commerce model. And in fact the speed of delivery is determined by the warehouse network, not by the last mine itself. And also the quality is very, very different. Custodies have delivery man, for those of you who live in China, you will know that because of our chaining and our corporate culture, JD did remain essentially a customer representative, we are very, very committed to be very thoughtful and provide service beyond just simple delivery. So it is a very different model in terms of both the speed determined by the warehouse network and the personal touch by our well trained delivery staff, so which we believe is still – will remain very, very differentiated with the third-party network utilizing the delivery companies. Operator The next question comes from the line of Ella Ji of China Renaissance. Please ask your questions. Ella Ji Thank you. For your current customer base, I wonder if you can share a breakdown between the male and the female? And for the new customers that you added, I wonder what are the categories that are attracting and these new customers coming to you for the first time? And also just regarding your advertising, I understand you won’t go aggressive in terms of adding more ad inventories, but can you talk about like what’s your efforts in the advertising targeting? So for example, to improve the clicks rate is better, can you just share us with some updates on that? Thank you. Sidney Huang Sure. So, for the male-female customer base, we’ve done analysis internally, because we don’t require customers to identify the agenda when they register, so we currently get a profit. So, definitely female customers have been increasing in proportion based on different analysis, they’re at least very close, but we believe the mail customers are still slightly higher in our overall customer base. So this is actually one of the key areas of new customer acquisition that we will be – this year is one of our key strategic focus is to attract female customers, for both our existing FMCG effort and also our enhanced apparel category effort. One of the initiatives in fact is to break out the apparel business from our existing apparel and home business unit. So we’ll form a separate apparel business group led by a new leader and we’ll implement a number of measures to enhance the platform to attract – attract the new female users. So – your second question is actually related, right. So it’s how – for example, the FMCG category is one of those we believe can attract many new customers, specifically senior customers. And obviously the existing business activities, our superior service level, our channel penetration into the lower tier cities, all of these efforts will help attract new customers to our platform. On your last question, I think it is actually somewhat related to our efforts to invest in technologies and artificial intelligence. So, we have been investing in this area to better target our customers and also provide more personalized documentations to – our products to consumers. Honestly we are still poised [ph] on reaching a satisfactory stage for this area. So, it’s – on the other hand, it is actually a great opportunity. If we can improve in customer targeting and advertising effectiveness, for example, and also just organic traffic utilization, we actually can see a much better conversion rate, for example, down the road. So it is one area for us for further improvement. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jialong Shi of Nomura. Please ask your questions. Jialong Shi Hi, good evening, Richard, Sidney, Ruiyu Li, thanks for taking my questions. I just wonder how do you think of your relationship with Walmart. We know Walmart has kept buying your shares in the open market in the past few months. So I just wonder if Walmart tries to seek a Board Directorship in the future, will you object to this move? Or you would welcome Walmart to become your new Board Director? And also, how much operating loss you booked for FMCG category into Q4 and how much you expect to invest in FMCG in this year? Thank you. Sidney Huang So, on the Walmart ownership, we actually disclosed in the last quarter, on the last earnings call that Walmart had reached 10% stake in JD.com and has a Board observer seat. In fact that is no further development from a share perspective. However, at the same time, the two companies have developed closer ties. During the past quarter our friendship – Sam’s Club flagship store on JD.com has seen very, very encouraging results. During the quarter, we’re also collaborating other new initiatives, which is yet to be announced. I mentioned about the data collaboration, we already in a very short period of time, so dozens of Walmart stores have been connected and slowed the data program to our JD data program. So many exciting initiatives we discussed and implemented. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Eric Glen from Blue Lotus. Please ask your question. Eric Glen Thanks management for taking my questions. I’m asking on behalf of Eric Glen. Please allow me to ask in Chinese first and then I’ll translate it into English. [Foreign Language] I’d like to ask two questions. First compared to Alibaba’s new retail, how much GMV do have a new China business you wish to achieve in 2017? And second, what’s the difference between Alibaba’s [indiscernible] and other new China business unit? Thank you. Sidney Huang Yes, sure. First of all, I don’t think that the two models are comparable. In fact, we believe we have explored the third quarter new retail model far ahead of our competition. In fact, the Oppo model at the JD home model which online to offline initiative that leverage the offline chain with online customer reach. So we have seen very, very encouraging results in our JD home business and especially after the merger into the new data. The average ticket size, the service level to our customers have seen significant improvement over the past six, seven months. So from our perspective, we do see tremendous opportunities in the integrated model between online and offline. For the [indiscernible] it’s actually a completely a separate business, that’s aiming to support the mom-and-pop shops in the cities and also rural areas. So it’s actually a quite different model that we’re still in a fairly early development stage. But given that JD.com has this highly sophisticated surprising capabilities and also our home last-mile delivery network, we believe our model is superior to any competition. Operator The next question comes from the line of Mr. Thomas Chong from BOCI. Please ask your question. Thomas Chong Hi, thanks management for taking my question. I have a quick question about the synergies we have $0.10. Can management provide some color about the percentage of new customers for Mobile QQ and leasing? Thanks. Sidney Huang Right. Yes, the collaboration has been very, very fruitful. We – if you look at the number of new customers accounted in the fourth quarter, it remain above 25%, so it’s a very solid new customer acquisition channel. So we also in addition to those two channels and the new customer acquisitions, we also have a number of other collaborations, including [indiscernible], which is a joint marketing and head of piping program working with key brands that we mentioned in the past. So we also have seen very encouraging results out of that program. Operator Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] of Barclays. Please ask your question. Unidentified Analyst Sidney, Richard, and Ruiyu, good evening. So the question is related to your gross margin. So as you’re expanding in your FMCG business and apparel business, so the ticket value compared with home appliance and so you see can be smaller. So the ticket, the size, each ticket, each deliver that you can not [indiscernible] can be worse than before. So how do you manage the gross margin growth going forward? Sidney Huang Right. Well, first of all, the gross margin is actually less affected by the ticker size itself, but operating margin will. For gross margin, as Richard mentioned earlier, that on the customer side, we will always maintain everyday low price plus very aggressive promotions and coupons. The gross margin were purely coming from our enhanced scale of economies. So, for example, for FMCG, we are today – even – we’re actually now the largest FMCG retailer yet in China. So as we continue to growing scale, we – it is fairly natural to see more and more scale of economies slow better purchasing price and more volume-based rebate. And that will continue to drive expanding gross margin result compromising our everyday low price and the promotions. But I think your question is more on the operating side. There is – there are always for sure to enhance the order economics. So one example – one simple example is through, as I mentioned earlier, requiring higher ticker size for free delivery, for example, right. And there are other methodologies to encourage customer to buy more through a certain promotional initiatives. So over time, the order economics will be improved through a higher ticket size. And you’re right that it will probably never get to the electronics and home appliance categories. But on the other hand, both apparel and consumer products do tend to carry higher gross margin than electronics category. Operator The next question comes from the line of Robin Hall of SunTrust. Please ask your question. Robin Hall Yes, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I wondered if you could discuss the logistics monetization as you move forward, I was trying to monetize some of your logistics network for your 3P providers, if you could provide any update sort of the traction there to-date and maybe what we should think about for the coming year in 2017? Thank you. Sidney Huang Sure. Yes, so we are actually aggressively expanding our service to our merchants. In the fourth quarter, for example, the merchants – the number of merchants adopting our service has increased quite meaningfully. And in terms of number of orders that were served by our warehouse network is not moving into high single-digit, which is a quite meaningful improvement. So, we have mentioned in the past that warehouse and delivery, the integrated service involving both will be – will differentiate the customer experience because of the speed and also the personal touch of the JD delivery staff. So but at – for many smaller merchants, it’s not necessary and easy addition. So it will be a natural progression that increasingly starting from more sellable merchants and then to mid-sized merchants. But we are seeing definitely very encouraging trend in our key merchants adopting the service. Operator We are now approaching the end of the conference call. I will now turn the call over to JD.com’s Ruiyu Li for closing remarks. Ruiyu Li Thanks, operator. Once again, thank you for joining us today.

The question-and-answer session of this conference call will start in a moment. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung of Merrill Lynch. Please ask your questions. Eddie Leung Good evening. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on a very solid quarter. Just real two quick questions. The first one is about your marketing business. Could you give us an update on the progress of your marketing business about your marketplace? Are we seeing the propositioned to your marketplace and others revenues going up from this business model? And then secondly, just some clarification on some recent news about expansion into offline stores in the rural areas. Anymore collar would be helpful? Thank you. Sidney Huang Okay. Eddie, I assume you’re asking about adverting business on the other revenues. So we have definitely seen our advertising business growing at a faster pace than our overall revenue growth. However, we have also refrained from aggressively monetizing at the expense – of the user experience. So our growth in our advertising program with merchant and suppliers is definitely moving ahead at a faster speed, but at the same time at a very – it’s quite a measured pace. So for the second question on offline stores, I assume, you’re asking about our franchised stores that we just recently announced. It will be an extension of our real program. It’s not really for JD to setting up physical stores, but we will work with local businesses to set up a franchise small stores. It’s a one level actually below our Jingdong Mall business model, which is at the county level. And the 10,000 stores that we mentioned is really working with villages at one level below the county level. So we can reach to broader consumers in the rural area. But it’s actually a asset-light business model. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please ask your questions. Alicia Yap Hi, thank you. Good evening, Richard, Sidney, and Ruiyu. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong results. My question is related to your gross margins. So as you’re seeing there are some – despite a year-over-year is an increase, but on the sequential base, it’s actually a decline. And it also seems like on the 1P margins itself sequentially seems to be about 70 basis points decline. So is that mainly because of the FMCG categories being bigger, or is it related to the seasonal aggressive promotional discount. And related to that is that how much are we targeting to spend on the sales and marketing to promote Yihaodian and also the FMCG category, and when will this category to achieve a break-even target? Thank you. Sidney Huang Sure, Alicia. So on the gross margin, you’re right that normally in Q2 and Q4, we will – during those major promotion events, gross margin tend to be slightly lower than the first quarter and the third quarter. So that’s the reason. So that’s why we always look at the gross margin trend on a year-over-year basis, which is more apples-to-apples. For the Yihaodian business, we continued to invest as part of our broader FMCG effort. And we have encouragingly see that from our own business. That is – the margin has been moving in the right direction, despite of the massive active – promotional activities that we are running during the fourth quarter, which is seeing a very, very encouraging results. The reason for that is really because of the scale of economies, as I mentioned earlier. The gross margin have seen meaningful improvement. And at the same time, we’re also optimizing our fulfillment infrastructure and also on the order economics driven by, for example, minimal order size required for free delivery. So we have seen – beginning to see a very meaningful improvement in both growth and order economics for the consumer product category. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please ask your question. Alex Yao Hi, good morning. Sorry, good morning and good evening, everyone. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the solid quarter. Two quick ones. One is regarding the strong top line growth momentum, particularly for Q1, which is a usually assume the weak quarter for you guys. Can you talk about what’s driving our revenue momentum there? And then secondly, just want to clarify that your 2017 net margin guidance is between 0% to 1% that included data loss pickup, which is about RMB1.4 billion this quarter. So assuming annualized RMB6 billion loss, you still expect it to be profitable next year, I’m sorry, this year? Sidney Huang Right. So on the first quarter revenue guidance, we do see the seasonal slowdown in growth rate. I guess, you’re comparing our growth rate to perhaps other industry players. From our perspective, we always strive to grow much faster than the industry average. So the current growth rate in our mind is, we hope it will be even stronger. So to us, this is only – we hope the – at a comfortable base and we can – we saw internal effort. We can outperform. For the 2017 net margin guidance, I know don’t know how you get to the RMB1.5 billion new data loss. The – as I mentioned in the past, you should assume about RMB100 million monthly run rate in losses – in loss pickup from new data. So that would be to round it, I’m referring to. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please ask your question. Alan Hellawell Great. Thank you very much. Just quickly, now that we have moved through a near calendar year of anti-brushing and decline in the sale of virtual items. Given that it’s now really a mirror [ph]. I was wondering if you could quantify how much of a tailwind this translates in 2017 for us? And also would just love a little more color around the free cash flow turning negative, increase in inventory that is in the fourth quarter, and what we might take on Board, as it relates to 2017? Thank you. Sidney Huang So, Alan, so for our GMV growth in 2017 by the second quarter basically will have the enhanced anti-brushing efforts that we announced last year. So all else being equal, you will see a more normalized growth rate. I can’t promise you for an acceleration, but at least by that time, it will be more apples-to-apples. We continue to work very hard to improve the quality of the products we list through our marketplace. So that ongoing effort we hope will pay off and both our customers and the quality merchants will benefit. On the free cash flow, as I mentioned Yihaodian my previous earnings call that there were some seasonal timing effect in Q3. So by Q4, we effectively those burst that timing difference. And again, when – for cash flow, because you could easily make some impact at quarter-end. So anything go quarter, cash flow will not reflect your ongoing cash flow momentum. So that’s why we always like to use the trailing 12 months as a better metric to measure free cash flow. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang of HSBC. Please ask your question. Chi Tsang Hi, good evening. Thank you very much for taking my question, and congrats on the nice set of results. I was just wondering if you can give us an update on sort of how Yihaodian is going both from a sort of a 1P and a 3P perspective? Thank you. Sidney Huang Right. So, as we mentioned in the last quarter actually beginning November 1, we took over the first-party business, while still utilizing the Yihaodian entity and its key to run the procurement for us. So it – the business has been very healthy. We see healthy growth on a year-over-year basis and it also contributed roughly RMB1.8 billion in the third – in the fourth quarter during those two months. So it’s a very healthy business and we look to further innovate utilizing this separate e-commerce platform. And we will, by the time the plan is finalized, we will announce to the market. So we will have a new position – positioning for Yihaodian to better serve the local communities. But in terms of category focus, it will continue to be focused on the FMCG and food and beverage categories. Operator [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Jin Yoon of Mizuho Securities. Please ask your question. Jin Yoon Hi, good evening. On the US$2.1 billion that you’re going to receive, is that going to come in stages, or should we expect that one payment – one lump sum payment? And second of all with that, is there a spending horizon for that cash flow you’re going to see, any CapEx cycle that we may see going forward? Thanks. Sidney Huang So, the RMB14.3 billion – oh, yes, you mean, US$2.1 billion, yes, we will receive that in a lump sum payment upon closing. So, we should expect to receive that in the middle of 2017. We have not have any specific use of the proceeds. But part of our ongoing investment, there will be CapEx requirement this year. I did mention last time that CapEx for 2016 was artificially low. Some of the projects were delayed due to the local land readiness. So you will see higher CapEx in 2017. But it will be covered by our operating cash flow in any event. Now the additional cash proceeds that we got from this transaction, obviously, we can also use it for strategic investments in our ecosystem and other general corporate purpose that we deemed appropriate. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Keung of Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question. Ronald Keung Thank you for taking my questions, and thank you Sidney. Just a question on the supermarket initiatives. Do you have any further cooperations or strategic plans with Walmart and Yonghui many across supply chain sourcing and O2O this year? Thank you. Sidney Huang Sure. Yes, so we have developed – we have a very healthy relationship with those two strategic partners, in particular, our new data entity is forming a closer partnership with those two companies. We disclosed that number first that are linked to our new data – Jingdong data platform. And in particular, increasingly, we have established separate picking centers in those stores. So that when a customer place an order, the items can be very quickly packaged and delivered. So, at – for JD [indiscernible] program, the current commitment is delivering within two hours. But if you look at the actual – in most of the stores, the delivery time is actually now down to about one hour. So the customer service level has been continuously improving with the closer partnership with those two supermarket partners. They are also potential – other potential collaborations, which is yet to be announced. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ming Zhao of 86Research. Please ask your question. Your line is now open. Ming Zhao from 86Research. Please ask your question. Ming Zhao Yes. So my question is, the JD Finance is spun-off from the company. But JD is generating a lot of cash, so for a lot of retail companies, the free cash flow is plenty and they use that to do investment and generate returns. So if JD Finance is spun-off, what can JD do to generate returns from those cash flows you generated? What’s a business model for that free cash flow generation? Thank you. Sidney Huang Right. So that’s an interesting question. In fact, even before we spin-off JD Finance, we had committed to the market that JD Finance starting 2016 would be self-funded. So we actually get in use JD.com’s free cash flow to fund JD Finance. We disclosed in the cash flow section of our earnings release the total cash inflow and cash outflow for JD Finance business and you can see that inflow actually was higher than outflow during the year. So that has been out philosophy that the Finance business should be independently run. JD.com has not either subsidized or deployed our capital to support the business beyond the initial investment. I actually mentioned about RMB2.1 billion that was the capital that we invested. On top of that, we did have a line of credit to JD Finance. That’s capped at around RMB10 billion. And that line of credit is still available. But as you can see in last year, that line of credit did not move up. And so that’s basically our separation of risk between JD.com and JD finance. So as far as the free cash flow, we do have actually many investment opportunities for the e-commerce ecosystem. So this – we’ve been very active in discussing strategic partnership with many of the potential partners either retail or on the product side. And we expect more of those investment opportunities to come up. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou of Credit Suisse. Please ask your questions. Evan Zhou Hi, good evening, Sidney. Thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on a very strong quarter. The question is regarding our FMCG category growth. I think couple of days ago we kind of announced that we have roughly like RMB100 billion of GMV in the quality finance for an FMCG category for this year. Is that a number that we can kind of reference our expectation on what is here? And also in terms of the contribution from the loss or in terms of the margin drag from the FMCG segment or JD supermarket, could you kind of provide some color to quantify that for this year? Thank you. Sidney Huang Sure, yes, I think the RMB100 billion is a three-year target, not for this year, okay. Yes, so this is obviously announced by our business unit. And it should be a number that’s pretty comfortably achievable. On the margin profile it is, as I mentioned earlier, we do see a trend of improving operating margin and narrowing operating loss for that business which is driven by both expanding gross margin due to the economies of scale. And also improving order economics through higher ticket size and a more efficient fulfillment. So it is definitely improving, but at the same time this remains the last major category that’s money losing. And we do believe because the characteristics of this unique category, it is worthwhile for us to continue to invest in this category at least in the next two years. And there will be obviously profitability potential for this business. Again, both from further improvement in the gross margin and also on order economics. Operator The next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please ask your question. Natalie Wu Hi, good evening Sydney, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very solid quarter. So my question is regarding – actually the average order size, it seems to be like stabilizing in fourth quarter? Also the fulfillment cost per order stabilizing as well. So just wondering if it’s mainly due to a seasonality phenomenon or should we expect the change to carry on in this year? Sidney Huang It’s actually both, so for normally in [Audio Gap] we see somewhat higher average order size because of the promotional events. But also for certain category, as I mentioned about FMCG, some of the new policies will actually tie the consumers to the ticket size gradually. So that trend will continue, we hope. But on the other hand, because the low ticket sized categories like FMCG and apparel and home furnishing are growing faster than the electronics and home appliance categories. So on a blended basis, you may not see average ticket size improving every quarter. So there is these two forces in getting to a blended average. Richard Liu Hello everyone, this is Richard speaking. I will try my best to speak English, but it will come out maybe really will be happy to offline later, calculate on my English to you all. I know a lot of the investors care about our FMCG category and also a lot of competitors gave a lot of rumors on the market. They said, look at me, I made so much money if I only return a little bit of my money and I take Jingdong to be our price war, say, would never ever been possible, we will buy sooner or later. If that’s wrong, I can give you two points. First one is, Yamato, our supplier, we have margin protection items, instead Jingdong will remain the lowest priced. If any competitor reduces the price, we have our rights to reduce our price on the same time, on the same level, but we’re a supplier, we’ll give out the same gross margin. So we’re not losing any money. To be honest sometime it starts to impact our gross margin a little bit because on the same time we’re not only reducing our price, we also give a huge coupon. We’ll give a lot of coupon to our customers, it’s our money, but not a significant impaction, just only a little bit. And second, actually a price war is very good of our company. I can give you two examples, first one is about books in 2009. We got into a price war with Jingdong in books category. And so after six years later I can tell you, last year, the books category has been profitable by quarterly. And in 2012 we also launched a price war with SUI [ph] about the larger home appliance. One day they lost a huge money because at that time we had no margin protection item at that time with our money. One day we lost RMB100 million and I’m sure every investor was quite on that night. But five years later, we’re currently number one, the largest today in China, both online and offline. And it has been profitable for some years. Today we’re also in our price war on FMCG category. But always the price war is the best news for us. I will recommend my shareholder any time like we had some price war with Jingdong, you should open a La curate brand of Champagne for that. Because it means sooner or later we will be number one and it will be profitable, it can make a lot of money for our shareholders. So let’s make it simple, no loss no wins, no profit and no worry. Thank you. Operator Your next question from the line of Wendy Huang of Macquarie, please ask your question. Wendy Huang Thank you. So you mentioned that if you – once you convert the profit sharing 40% to equity ownership, there are some regulatory approval you need to go through. So can you give some detail on what kind of the government approval that you need to obtain in order to achieve that? Also you mentioned that you will get the profit sharing only after the company actually will achieve the cumulative profit. So what is the cumulative loss as of now? Thank you. Sidney Huang So if we keep in mind that the spin-off, in the first place, is done to facilitate JD Finance to, one, to apply for certain licenses for them for the securities license that will require strict domestic shareholder base. And second, the methods of shareholding structure will facilitate a future domestic listing. So for those two areas as of now the regulation will not permit us to convert the 40% profit sharing right back into equity. However, in the future, should the regulations become and offset – regulations change in those two areas for example, then clearly we would have the option to convert back into equity. We have – on your second question, we have not disclosed our cumulative losses. We will, however, disclose more segment information in our annual report, where you will see, at least, the operating losses for our new business lines, which will give you a fairly good idea on the JD Finance profile. It is a private company, so we are not disclosing the exact loss amount at this point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Choi of Daiwa. Please ask your question. John Choi Good evening and good morning and thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a great set of results. I have a couple questions here. Sidney, I was wondering if you could kind of clarify or give more color on the strategic reinvestment that you mentioned that you said, given that JD Finance is now being officially spun-off and it’s taking investment return products et cetera. I was wondering what kind of areas and how big kind of investments, because I’m thinking of and how we should think over the longer term? And the second question is in your fulfillment area. I mean, if you look at the fulfillment, we are seeing nice operating leverage, but as you can see recently, a lot of the third-party logistics providers have been coming to the market with IPO. We’ve heard a lot of aggressive investment plans from them. So is JD required to a further step-up in investment and you know in order to compete or maintain its competitive advantage versus these players and should we thinking about additional CapEx related to this? Thank you. Sidney Huang So for investment, we always maintained that all of our investments will be strategic and we are very focused to invest in the ecosystem around our e-commerce business and also on the new technologies. So, as we also mentioned in our earnings release that we had actually laid out next obvious strategic plan to invest further into the technologies, in particular, in artificial intelligence and Big Data for example, so some of the investments will potentially be invested in these technology areas. So – but they will all be very much related to our core business. On your second question, we addressed this before that and our logistic network is actually quite different from certainly that, which is purely a delivery company. So for us, we – it’s an integrated warehousing network and last mile delivery, which is very unique for an e-commerce model. And in fact the speed of delivery is determined by the warehouse network, not by the last mine itself. And also the quality is very, very different. Custodies have delivery man, for those of you who live in China, you will know that because of our chaining and our corporate culture, JD did remain essentially a customer representative, we are very, very committed to be very thoughtful and provide service beyond just simple delivery. So it is a very different model in terms of both the speed determined by the warehouse network and the personal touch by our well trained delivery staff, so which we believe is still – will remain very, very differentiated with the third-party network utilizing the delivery companies. Operator The next question comes from the line of Ella Ji of China Renaissance. Please ask your questions. Ella Ji Thank you. For your current customer base, I wonder if you can share a breakdown between the male and the female? And for the new customers that you added, I wonder what are the categories that are attracting and these new customers coming to you for the first time? And also just regarding your advertising, I understand you won’t go aggressive in terms of adding more ad inventories, but can you talk about like what’s your efforts in the advertising targeting? So for example, to improve the clicks rate is better, can you just share us with some updates on that? Thank you. Sidney Huang Sure. So, for the male-female customer base, we’ve done analysis internally, because we don’t require customers to identify the agenda when they register, so we currently get a profit. So, definitely female customers have been increasing in proportion based on different analysis, they’re at least very close, but we believe the mail customers are still slightly higher in our overall customer base. So this is actually one of the key areas of new customer acquisition that we will be – this year is one of our key strategic focus is to attract female customers, for both our existing FMCG effort and also our enhanced apparel category effort. One of the initiatives in fact is to break out the apparel business from our existing apparel and home business unit. So we’ll form a separate apparel business group led by a new leader and we’ll implement a number of measures to enhance the platform to attract – attract the new female users. So – your second question is actually related, right. So it’s how – for example, the FMCG category is one of those we believe can attract many new customers, specifically senior customers. And obviously the existing business activities, our superior service level, our channel penetration into the lower tier cities, all of these efforts will help attract new customers to our platform. On your last question, I think it is actually somewhat related to our efforts to invest in technologies and artificial intelligence. So, we have been investing in this area to better target our customers and also provide more personalized documentations to – our products to consumers. Honestly we are still poised [ph] on reaching a satisfactory stage for this area. So, it’s – on the other hand, it is actually a great opportunity. If we can improve in customer targeting and advertising effectiveness, for example, and also just organic traffic utilization, we actually can see a much better conversion rate, for example, down the road. So it is one area for us for further improvement. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jialong Shi of Nomura. Please ask your questions. Jialong Shi Hi, good evening, Richard, Sidney, Ruiyu Li, thanks for taking my questions. I just wonder how do you think of your relationship with Walmart. We know Walmart has kept buying your shares in the open market in the past few months. So I just wonder if Walmart tries to seek a Board Directorship in the future, will you object to this move? Or you would welcome Walmart to become your new Board Director? And also, how much operating loss you booked for FMCG category into Q4 and how much you expect to invest in FMCG in this year? Thank you. Sidney Huang So, on the Walmart ownership, we actually disclosed in the last quarter, on the last earnings call that Walmart had reached 10% stake in JD.com and has a Board observer seat. In fact that is no further development from a share perspective. However, at the same time, the two companies have developed closer ties. During the past quarter our friendship – Sam’s Club flagship store on JD.com has seen very, very encouraging results. During the quarter, we’re also collaborating other new initiatives, which is yet to be announced. I mentioned about the data collaboration, we already in a very short period of time, so dozens of Walmart stores have been connected and slowed the data program to our JD data program. So many exciting initiatives we discussed and implemented. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Eric Glen from Blue Lotus. Please ask your question. Eric Glen Thanks management for taking my questions. I’m asking on behalf of Eric Glen. Please allow me to ask in Chinese first and then I’ll translate it into English. [Foreign Language] I’d like to ask two questions. First compared to Alibaba’s new retail, how much GMV do have a new China business you wish to achieve in 2017? And second, what’s the difference between Alibaba’s [indiscernible] and other new China business unit? Thank you. Sidney Huang Yes, sure. First of all, I don’t think that the two models are comparable. In fact, we believe we have explored the third quarter new retail model far ahead of our competition. In fact, the Oppo model at the JD home model which online to offline initiative that leverage the offline chain with online customer reach. So we have seen very, very encouraging results in our JD home business and especially after the merger into the new data. The average ticket size, the service level to our customers have seen significant improvement over the past six, seven months. So from our perspective, we do see tremendous opportunities in the integrated model between online and offline. For the [indiscernible] it’s actually a completely a separate business, that’s aiming to support the mom-and-pop shops in the cities and also rural areas. So it’s actually a quite different model that we’re still in a fairly early development stage. But given that JD.com has this highly sophisticated surprising capabilities and also our home last-mile delivery network, we believe our model is superior to any competition. Operator The next question comes from the line of Mr. Thomas Chong from BOCI. Please ask your question. Thomas Chong Hi, thanks management for taking my question. I have a quick question about the synergies we have $0.10. Can management provide some color about the percentage of new customers for Mobile QQ and leasing? Thanks. Sidney Huang Right. Yes, the collaboration has been very, very fruitful. We – if you look at the number of new customers accounted in the fourth quarter, it remain above 25%, so it’s a very solid new customer acquisition channel. So we also in addition to those two channels and the new customer acquisitions, we also have a number of other collaborations, including [indiscernible], which is a joint marketing and head of piping program working with key brands that we mentioned in the past. So we also have seen very encouraging results out of that program. Operator Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] of Barclays. Please ask your question. Unidentified Analyst Sidney, Richard, and Ruiyu, good evening. So the question is related to your gross margin. So as you’re expanding in your FMCG business and apparel business, so the ticket value compared with home appliance and so you see can be smaller. So the ticket, the size, each ticket, each deliver that you can not [indiscernible] can be worse than before. So how do you manage the gross margin growth going forward? Sidney Huang Right. Well, first of all, the gross margin is actually less affected by the ticker size itself, but operating margin will. For gross margin, as Richard mentioned earlier, that on the customer side, we will always maintain everyday low price plus very aggressive promotions and coupons. The gross margin were purely coming from our enhanced scale of economies. So, for example, for FMCG, we are today – even – we’re actually now the largest FMCG retailer yet in China. So as we continue to growing scale, we – it is fairly natural to see more and more scale of economies slow better purchasing price and more volume-based rebate. And that will continue to drive expanding gross margin result compromising our everyday low price and the promotions. But I think your question is more on the operating side. There is – there are always for sure to enhance the order economics. So one example – one simple example is through, as I mentioned earlier, requiring higher ticker size for free delivery, for example, right. And there are other methodologies to encourage customer to buy more through a certain promotional initiatives. So over time, the order economics will be improved through a higher ticket size. And you’re right that it will probably never get to the electronics and home appliance categories. But on the other hand, both apparel and consumer products do tend to carry higher gross margin than electronics category. Operator The next question comes from the line of Robin Hall of SunTrust. Please ask your question. Robin Hall Yes, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I wondered if you could discuss the logistics monetization as you move forward, I was trying to monetize some of your logistics network for your 3P providers, if you could provide any update sort of the traction there to-date and maybe what we should think about for the coming year in 2017? Thank you. Sidney Huang Sure. Yes, so we are actually aggressively expanding our service to our merchants. In the fourth quarter, for example, the merchants – the number of merchants adopting our service has increased quite meaningfully. And in terms of number of orders that were served by our warehouse network is not moving into high single-digit, which is a quite meaningful improvement. So, we have mentioned in the past that warehouse and delivery, the integrated service involving both will be – will differentiate the customer experience because of the speed and also the personal touch of the JD delivery staff. So but at – for many smaller merchants, it’s not necessary and easy addition. So it will be a natural progression that increasingly starting from more sellable merchants and then to mid-sized merchants. But we are seeing definitely very encouraging trend in our key merchants adopting the service. Operator We are now approaching the end of the conference call. I will now turn the call over to JD.com’s Ruiyu Li for closing remarks. Ruiyu Li Thanks, operator. Once again, thank you for joining us today.

This conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements concerning our expected financial performance for our second fiscal quarter ending December 30, 2016, our market positioning and growth opportunities, our strategic platform, integration activities and achievement of synergy goals, demand in market trends, the benefits of our short-term incentive compensation programs, our product portfolio, product features and their benefits, product transitions and other development efforts and customer acceptance of our products and manufacturing yields and cost improvements. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 29, 2016. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. Further, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable historical GAAP financial measures will be posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because material items that impact these measures are out of our control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. In the question-answer session part of our call today, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up to allow as many callers as possible during our allotted time. I thank you in advance for that. And I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Milligan. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter results and wrap-up with our guidance for the fiscal second quarter. I'm pleased with our performance in the September quarter, our first full quarter as an integrated company following the SanDisk acquisition in May. We reported revenue of $4.7 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 34%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.18, exceeding our revised guidance in each category. We continued to experience strong demand throughout the September quarter for both hard drive and flash-based products from all categories of customers, largely driven by cloud and mobility based applications, as well as better than expected PC demand and our own outperformance in certain categories. These trends are expected to continue in the December quarter. We are delivering our financial performance through continued strong execution by the newly-combined Western Digital team, demonstrating the power of our broad-based and unique platform. The platform includes an unparalleled breadth of storage product offerings, expanded vertical integration and go-to-market capabilities, an increasing level of customer intimacy and a proven ability to innovate and sustain leadership across multiple storage technologies. We have made significant progress establishing this strategic platform by combining and leveraging the collective strengths and resources of legacy HGST, SanDisk and WD. Our platform is aligned with our vision of the continued rapid growth of data and its increasing importance in our everyday lives. The power and promise of data is undeniable. It is creating a world that's more predictive, more productive and more personal, enabling smarter decisions, breakthrough discoveries and deeper connections. The Western Digital platform is at the core of enabling the possibilities of data. It differentiates us from our competitors and we believe it will drive our company to a future of growth and long-term industry leadership. We are already seeing the benefits of the platform in our differentiated financial results and outlook. I am very pleased that we have achieved this financial performance, while, at the same time, successfully executing on two top priorities, namely, the integrations of HGST, SanDisk and WD, and the transition to next-generation NAND technology. Integration of the three companies is proceeding very well, and our synergy achievements are on track. I'm also pleased to note that our transition to 3D NAND technology continues to progress as planned and we will begin a significant commercial ramp of our second-generation 3D NAND with 64 layers in the first half of calendar 2017, as previously announced. Mike Cordano will now report on our business highlights in the September quarter. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our operational execution and the resulting business performance for the September quarter. The industry supply/demand environment in both HDDs and flash was favorable. With a full quarter of the legacy SanDisk business results integrated into the company, our Q1 report reflects the strength of our broad portfolio addressing a similarly expanded market opportunity. As part of our mission to build a compelling Western Digital platform, we continue to make progress with integrating the HGST and SanDisk businesses and we are on pace with our plan to further streamline our product and technology base (7:06). Turning to our highlights in the quarter. In data center devices and solutions, we delivered solid year-over-year growth in total exabytes shipped, primarily driven by continued strength in cloud-related demand for our near-line capacity HDDs, with that product category alone driving almost 50% year-over-year growth in exabytes shipped. I'm very pleased to report that our industry-leading 10 terabyte helium drive gained further adoption at several of our major OEM and cloud customers, reflecting the compelling value proposition of this offering. Just two weeks ago, we achieved an important milestone for our HelioSeal platform, with cumulative shipments exceeding 10 million units, representing approximately 76 exabytes of storage capacity since the launch of this platform in late 2013. This technology, now in its third generation, enables even higher density HDDs specifically designed for data center applications and will be able to incorporate future magnetic recording technologies. In data center solutions, we are pleased with SoftBank's adoption of our InfiniFlash all-flash storage platform for their new software-defined storage solution. In client devices, we experienced strong demand for our HDDs and SSDs for PCs, as that market continued to show signs of stabilization and we outperformed in both product categories. Our 3 bits per cell based embedded NAND solutions saw increased adoption in mobile phones, as this technology offers a compelling value proposition compared to 2 bits per cell based alternatives. I am pleased to note that our embedded 3 bits per cell solutions are now qualified and shipping to the majority of the world's top mobile handset vendors. We are now deepening our participation in the automotive, connected home and industrial categories, reflecting our commitment to driving innovations beyond the traditional mobile application. These are important long-term growth opportunities with longer product cycles for both our embedded and removable offerings. Our performance in client solutions, which includes retail offerings from legacy HGST, SanDisk and WD, was strong during the September quarter, and our combined portfolio of flash and HDD products has generated excellent reception from customers. Following a successful back-to-school sales period, performance in our retail channel remains solid, reflecting strength in both demand trends as well as preference for our brands. We demonstrated continued innovation in our removable product categories with the announcement of the world's first 1 terabit SD card. From a NAND technology perspective, we have begun OEM sampling of our second generation of 3D NAND technology of 64 layers and we're on track to deliver volume shipments of removable product with this technology in the December quarter. Our previously discussed plan to begin a significant commercial ramp of 64-layer 3D NAND in the first half of calendar year 2017 remains on track. Our first generation of 3D NAND technology with 3 bits per cell in a 48-layer architecture is shipping in embedded mobile and removable products. We continue to ship products using our 15 nanometer 2D NAND technology, which is achieving new manufacturing milestones in terms of yields and cost improvements. In summary, I'm pleased with our first quarter performance and the execution by our team. The opportunities we are creating through integrating HGST, SanDisk and WD are significant and we are making good progress in setting up Western Digital for long-term growth and success. In the December quarter, we expect overall supply/demand conditions in both HDD and NAND to remain constrained resulting in favorable industry dynamics. The longer-term drivers of demand for storage are vibrant and we are focused on our offering industry-leading portfolio to drive the best results for our customers and shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Thank you, Mike. I'm encouraged by our financial performance this quarter. Our teams executed well in a solid market environment as we capitalized on our strong product offering, achieved targeted costs and efficiency improvements and reduced our cost of debt, primarily due to two re-pricing transactions. Our key financial metrics continued to improve following the revised guidance we provided on September 7 due to both favorable market dynamics and consistent execution by our team. Our revenue for the September quarter was $4.7 billion, driven by strong performance across each of our end-markets. Revenue in datacenter devices and solutions was $1.4 billion, client devices was $2.3 billion, and client solutions was $1 billion. Our datacenter revenue growth continues to be driven largely by cloud-related storage demand. As a result, we saw continued strength in capacity enterprise HDDs, stable demand for performance enterprise HDDs, as well as positive market dynamics for enterprise SSDs. Client devices benefited from seasonally strong demand for HDDs in gaming and PC applications as well as flash-based products in PCs and mobile handsets. In client solutions, our revenue grew as a function of seasonality and healthy demand for removable and other flash-based products. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 33.6%, which was up 260 basis points versus the June quarter. We were able to achieve this margin expansion through continued product cost improvements and better than anticipated pricing for certain HDD and flash products. Our product cost improvement resulted from increased volumes, consistent execution and ongoing progress with our integration activities. Gross margin also benefited from our first full quarter of flash revenue, which helped to offset the seasonal increase in lower margin HDD gaming revenue, the latter of which typically peaks in the September quarter. Turning to the discussion of operating expenses. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $952 million. We incurred higher short-term incentive compensation due to stronger business performance, which nonetheless was partially offset by continued progress towards our integration synergy target. Let me take a few moments to explain our short-term incentive compensation program. It is based on goals set on a semiannual basis. We believe this semiannual approach to incentive compensation allows us to effectively navigate changing market environments. To understand the underlying business performance, it is useful to normalize these payments across periods. For example, the payouts in the first six months of calendar 2016 were significantly below target, while the payouts for the second half are currently expected to be above target. As a result, the annualized payout would be at a roughly 100% target level. Non-GAAP interest and other expense for the quarter was $227 million. On August 17, we reduced our U.S. Term Loan B balance by $750 million through a voluntary prepayment and repriced the remaining $3 billion balance. On September 22, we repriced our euro-denominated Term Loan B with a balance of €885 million. The aggregate annual non-GAAP and cash interest savings from the two repricing transactions are approximately $150 million and $120 million, respectively, on a going forward basis. These transactions resulted in $267 million of debt extinguishment charges in our GAAP interest and other expenses, $227 million of which were non-cash charges. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was approximately 16%, within our expected range of 15% to 20% for this period. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter was $341 million, or $1.18 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $366 million, or $1.28 per share. The GAAP net loss for the period includes charges associated with our recent acquisitions, debt extinguishment charges related to our repricing and repayment of outstanding debt. Essentially, the entire net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is a result of non-cash charges. In the September quarter, we generated $440 million of cash from operations, with $210 million spent on capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $230 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion, compared to the June quarter end balance of $8.2 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by repayment of $4.2 billion of debt, consisting of the acquisition bridge loan, U.S. Term Loan B and SanDisk convertible debt. As Steve and Mike indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration. From a synergy standpoint, we remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017, and expect to exit the December quarter of this year having achieved more than $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $300 million of operating expense synergies each on an annual run rate basis. With respect to the SanDisk integration, we expect to exit the December quarter having realized synergies of approximately $130 million on an annual run rate basis toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis. Now, I would like to describe a change we are implementing in our non-GAAP reporting, beginning with our December quarter. To better reflect the performance of the underlying business operations in our results, and to be more consistent with the majority of our technology peers, we will be excluding stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP results. All future guidance, including today's for the December quarter, will be on this basis. The stock-based compensation portion of our total operating expenses is typically between $75 million and $85 million per quarter. If we had made this change in our September quarter, our non-GAAP operating expenses would have declined $89 million from $952 million to $863 million, our non-GAAP cost of revenue would have also decreased $15 million and our non-GAAP tax expense would have been reduced $3 million. The total stock-based compensation expense impact would have increased non-GAAP net income by $107 million to $448 million. Non-GAAP EPS would have increased from $1.18 to $1.54. We are posting this data with some historical comparisons on the Investor Relations section of our website for your information. With that, I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter on the new non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense. While the September quarter is typically the high point of our revenue due to seasonality, we expect our December quarter revenue to be equally strong due to the continuation of favorable industry dynamics and the success of our broadened product portfolio. As such, we now expect revenue in our December quarter to be approximately flat to the September quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to increase to approximately 35%, driven by improved product mix reflecting lower gaming volume and outperformance in other key areas. I would like to note that we have only included half a quarter of license and royalty revenue from our cross-license agreement with Samsung, which, as you know, expired on August 14 and under which revenue was recognized one quarter in arrear. We remain in constructive negotiations with Samsung, working toward a new agreement and will provide further updates as this situation changes. Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to total approximately $805 million, which includes higher variable compensation expense given our outperformance of the targets set for the first six months of our fiscal year. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million, reflecting a full quarter benefit from our lower interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs from the debt repricing and paydown transactions. We expect an effective tax rate in the 14% to 16% range. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95, with an estimated share count 293 million diluted shares. I would note, on our previous non-GAAP basis including stock-based compensation expense, the high end of our earnings per share guidance would have been approximately $1.60. At our Investor Day on December 6, we will provide a deeper dive into our strategy, business operations, technology capabilities and long-term financial model, which should give further clarity on what we expect to deliver across key financial metrics for the new Western Digital. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. Our first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Unknown Speaker Hi. This is (23:19) on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on your revenue beat. I see that your net revenue is 4% ahead of your pre-announcement, which only happened last month. So what kind of linearity trends you are seeing? Did the market trends accelerate towards the back half of the quarter? Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Sure. So for the quarter, linearity was very strong. And we experienced strong demand and favorable pricing since the guidance we provided in early September. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. So if you look at it, of our revenue over-achievement from our previous guidance of $4.5 billion to the $4.7 billion, about 80% of that over-achievement was due to higher than expected demand and the balance was a bit better pricing. Unknown Speaker Okay. Great. As a follow-up, could you comment on your expectations for the NAND market bit growth as well as your bit growth? And then a bit on your expectations for pricing? Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. So talking about the current calendar year, we would expect that bit growth to be around the mid-30%, about 35% for the industry. And in our case, we had previously talked about something in the low-30% induced to some very good work by our operational teams that will be closer to the industry rate exiting this year. We'd expect next year to be in the mid-40%s, approximately 45%, both for the industry and for ourselves as we transition as an industry and we transition to 3D NAND technology. Unknown Speaker Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yeah. Thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter. As we think about building our models and you look at the variable compensation components that are included in the expectations, how should we think about variable comp going into the December quarter? And I think at one conference, you had recently noted that that will start to tail off as you realize some of the synergies from these integrations, particularly HGST. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. So the variable comp that is really driving the deltas here is our short-term bonus that's paid over a six-month horizon, as I was indicating earlier. And so for Q4, calendar Q4, we'll still have some of that effect. But as you go into calendar Q1, our fiscal Q3, that effect will be eliminated as we reset the target. And our forecast would include a normalized 100% target achievement there. So the best way to think about this normalized OpEx is that, from a calendar Q1 standpoint through to really the end of fiscal 2017, you're going to see a steady trend downward. So, first, when we talk about normalizing, we exclude the stock-based compensation. And then we bring our short-term bonus to 100%. So for the first six months of the calendar year, as we said, you'll actually be adding back some of the bonus that we didn't pay because we were below that 100% target. And for the remainder of the calendar year 2016, you would be deducting that overage, and then for the first half of calendar 2017, you would not have that short-term bonus effect. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, I'm just curious on cloud pretty universally has been cited as strong across many different companies. I'm curious beyond the December quarter how you're currently thinking about cloud demand, near-line demand, in particular going into the first half of 2017? Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. Let me just follow up and give you another data point because we're conscious of the challenges modeling some of the transitions here. But when you think about the first quarter of calendar 2017, I want to kind of give you a perspective on where the normalized OpEx should range. And a way to think about that for modeling purposes would be in the $770 million range. So, hopefully, that helped. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. So, we wanted to close off that, Aaron, and Mike can talk about cloud demand. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Perfect. Very helpful. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Sure. All right. Relative to the cloud demand capacity enterprise, specifically I noted in my prepared remarks, we saw a year-over-year increase of nearly 50%. We see this year in total running around 38% or above our long-term model of 35%. As we look into calendar 2017, we're not updating our long-term model at this point. But, we would suggest that things will run to sort of a bias up above that kind of consistent with what we're seeing this year. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Thank you. Good luck. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Mehdi Hosseini, thank you. David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Yeah, actually it's not Mehdi, it's David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini on the line. Thank you so much for taking the question. Can you guys talk about your HDD capacity in terms of units and/or exabytes? And what you've done in that regard and how that trend over the next quarters? And in that context, how we can think about capacity utilization? And I have a follow-up. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. So, this is Steve, I'll take that. So I would say that, I mean, there's a lot of dynamics that are going on in terms of our hard drive capacity because as you know, over the last kind of several years, we've been going through a manufacturing rationalization process given declines that we've seen in the hard drive market. So, there are kind of different puts and takes when you look at various different products for various different factory locations. But on balance right now in terms of hard drive manufacturing, I would say that we are kind of reasonably balanced. In other words, we're able to largely meet overall customer demand. And again, we're going to continue to rationalize this as we move forward. The one thing that we're a little bit cautious about and keeping our eye on is that, obviously when you're talking about capacity enterprise products, which, as Mike indicated, the demand in that space has been reasonably robust. And that uses a lot of heads and disks because of the platter count. And we have less flexibility both in terms of lead time and capacity in terms of heads and disks. And so as we look at that and as we watch and work closely with our customers, if for one reason or another we would see, call it, a spike from a demand perspective, our ability to meet some of that upside might be more limited. So, that's one thing that we're a bit cautious on right now. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we're at from a utilization and capacity perspective on the HDD front. David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Great. Thanks, Steve. And as a follow-up for Mark, how can we think about the cash conversion cycle, and more broadly speaking, like a normalized free cash flow rate as you've gotten your arms around the balance sheet and cash generation capability? Just any insight in how we can model that going forward. Thanks. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Sure. So from a cash conversion cycle standpoint, I think you can model basically where we've been over the last couple of quarters, but you'll have some changing dynamics. So what I would expect is inventory will likely trend up and this is really a function of us building strategic reserves as we restructure parts of our supply chain. And then eventually, you'll see the NAND parts of our business, the allocation will begin to soften and we'll begin to build more inventory. So, that will trend upwards a little bit, but you'll then I think see payables be extended from where they were in Q1. So, I think, overall, you'll see a cash conversion cycle in about the range that it's been. And in terms of the cash flow generation margin, we're actually going to have a little bit more noise in that equation for the next few quarters, primarily as a function of our restructuring and ongoing integration activities. But, one of the things we will be doing during Investor Day is providing more visibility into the dynamics of that as well as a way to think about our long-term financial modeling and the key metric around cash flow generation. David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, this is Jeriel on behalf of Amit. I just have a few questions here. Number one, can you just touch on what drove the gross margin upside? I think it was up about 60 basis points versus your positive pre and 160 basis points versus initial guide. Was this more HDD or NAND or cost integration, and some rank order would be valuable? Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. So I think as we mentioned, the favorable pricing was across both parts of our business, but primarily in the NAND area. And we did experience some additional benefits from mix, especially given the fact that we had the first full quarter of the flash product revenue. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. And also the strong performance in terms of capacity enterprise as well. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. And I mean, there's a lot of dynamics. The other thing I'd just add is that we continue to make progress in terms of our integration synergy goals. So, that continues to provide some headwind – or not headwind, tailwinds for us in terms of our margin performance. So, it was really kind of oversimplified, it was kind of a little bit of everything, kind of across the board. Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC All right. Thanks for that. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. Just to finish that thought, we would expect those same drivers to carry forward into the second fiscal quarter and that's driving the expansion of gross margin. Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC Thank you. And as a follow-up, I understand that you're only including about 45 days of that Samsung contribution, which makes sense. If or when you get a resolution with Samsung, would they back pay your payments from November 15 onwards or... Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. We would certainly hope so, yes, because the agreement expired on August 14. So when we put a new agreement in place, we would expect it to be retroactive to that date. Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC All right. Thank you so much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. James Kisner - Jefferies LLC Thank you very much. So I believe you said near-line demand was up 50% year-over-year in exabytes shipped. I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on how that translates to revenue change year-over-year, and I guess, related to that, change in price per bit year-over-year. And I guess relatedly, have you seen a more rational competitive environment for near-line and what has happened to your share in near-line quarter-on-quarter? Thanks. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. So from a translation to a revenue standpoint, it's about half that in terms of the increase in revenue. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. In terms of market dynamics, I think we think it's fairly balanced and as we expected. And I think relative to total bit participation, we think we've improved our position sequentially and we see a trend of that going forward really relative to our increasing sales of our 10 terabyte offering. James Kisner - Jefferies LLC All right. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC Thanks. Good afternoon. Just getting back to your revenue guidance for a second, I was wondering if there's any other puts and takes you can talk to in terms of how you get to the flat, either by the three business segments you've established or maybe even hopefully by some product categories as well? And then I had an enterprise follow-up question. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Sure. So let me talk about our end-markets. For datacenter devices, you can think about that whole category being roughly flat. When it comes to client devices, I think within that, while the whole category again will be roughly flat, you'll have some puts and takes. You'll see continued strength in client SSD, but we'll see gaming and, to some extent, notebook HDDs sort of come off that seasonal peak and then we'll see a little strength in desktop. When it comes to our client solutions, we actually see strength across both our HDD and flash-based products. So I think on balance, it's flat to slightly up for each of the three categories. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. The largest single variable there is that seasonality of the gaming marketplace, so that peaks, as Mark said, in calendar Q3. So that's the largest single variable within that. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC Great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, as you mentioned, you have a unique view into enterprise storage now. I was wondering if you could just compare average capacity trends between HDDs and SSDs into some of the cloud data centers that you have projects in and how the growth rates compare and contrast. Thank you very much. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Yeah, on a growth rate basis, the capacity growth rate for flash exceeds that of disk. And so that trend continues. That's been ongoing for some time and that's really specifically related to hyperscale deployments. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC Thank you. Good afternoon. Just one question for me, tagging onto that last question. So Micron, for example, has been touting its 15 terabyte drive. And I'm just interested in, may be best from Mike, how do you see the next few years playing out on the highest capacity points between hard drives and SSDs? How do you position these two? And does WD get to a point where it just is indifferent to whatever people select for cloud hyperscale environments? Thanks. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. So I think, Rich, it still begins with the workload and then the cost per bit that optimally supports that workload. So going forward, we don't see a convergence to an all-flash world anytime soon, frankly, anytime in our planning horizon. So what we do see is continued growth of capacity enterprise that we articulated. That's going be long into the future, although flash revenue and flash bits on a proportionate basis is growing faster. So from that standpoint, that's the trend we would point you to. And they have very different purposes in the hierarchy. So we continue to obviously work closely with those and are innovating around data center architectures and we intend to deploy our technology and our products in an optimal way to those trends. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC How much of a price differential is there today between the SSD version and a comparable capacity hard drive? Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. It varies depending on performance requirements, et cetera, but it would run between 5X and 10X. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc. Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. I apologize if the questions have been asked. I've been jumping between a couple calls. The first question is, can you talk a little more about next year if demand improvement in both flash and disk drives continue from an end market perspective, could we see any capacity cuts driving a shortage or a constraint issue next year from one or both segments? And the other question is around the exclusion of stock options. Can you talk a little more about the philosophy there, just given that we were aware of SanDisk and the overhang there previously, why the change now and what's the impetus? That would be great. Thank you. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Okay. Let me talk about the supply/demand environment. We said publicly and we'll reiterate here that we see constrained supply in the NAND side of our business through calendar year 2017. And that's primarily driven by two things, end market demand for that class of technology and the rate and pace of the industry's conversion to 3D NAND. Relative to the hard drive market, I think at this point we would see that as a normal or balanced environment. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. And then, Mark, with respect to the decision to exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP results, we really had two primary drivers. One was just the way we run the business. And our stock-based compensation expense actually has some elements of it that are either short term in nature or are variable. And as a result, it injects some variability that undermines our ability to demonstrate or track the improvements we're making from a synergy realization standpoint. So that's the first driver. The second driver is that we are more and more focused on our cash flow generation and looking at our results from a cash standpoint, particularly given our balance sheet. And by excluding the stock-based compensation, we are better able to highlight and track the cash flow impact of our operating decision. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Now, one thing, Mark, that I will add to that. This is Steve. Is that we fully recognize the fact that there is an impact in the form of dilution from stock-based compensation and we remain not only aware of that, but sensitive of that. And if you look at our proxy statement in terms of compensation philosophies and that sort of thing, there's no change in that regard in terms of what we're doing. It's more a matter of excluding those figures to provide more meaningful analytical information, if you want to call it that, to the financial community. But I don't want people to think that we don't recognize the fact that there is a dilution component as it relates to our existing shareholders. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. And Mark, I think as you know, part of the calculus was looking at the comparable peers. And what they do to try to provide an easier basis for comparison, so. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I know it's difficult to guide NAND gross margins since ASPs are beyond your control. But do you think your cost improvement will be above or below your long-term expectations of 20% in 2016 as you ramp 3D? And maybe, what's your expectation in 2017, calendar 2017, as 3D becomes a larger part of your mix? And I have a follow up, please. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Okay. So we've talked about sort of the cost reduction domain of kind of three generations – or three periods in the NAND industry. Very early on, it was running at around a 50% annualized rate. The next period was running at about a 30% rate. Frankly, that's now ending as we come to the conclusion of plainer NAND. As we move fully as an industry into 3D, once we're through the transition, we expect around a 20% per year cost reduction capability. So, that's the way we would guide you to think about that. Obviously, there are some perturbations as we transition from 2D to 3D, but that's the way to think about it from a long-term modeling perspective. Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC Got it. I can appreciate that. And then in the context of your bit growth outlook for calendar 2017 that you just gave and also your past comments that 3D NAND will be 40% of your overall bit output by the end of next calendar year, should we expect the majority of your 3D outlook to be 64-layer or will it be more weighted toward 48-layer? Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. It will be 64-layer. And I think we have – what's the right number for exit rate in 2017? Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. It's around 40%, but its wafers out. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Oh. Okay. So not bit output, it's just wafers out? Okay. So the 40% is wafers out. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Correct. And the other comment I'll make, just to clarify, 48-layer, we've talked about, is really a learning node for us. So, to just reiterate what Steve said, the volume as we exit next calendar year will be predominantly the 64-layer. Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC Hi, guys. Hey, congratulations and thanks for taking the question. One and then a quick follow up. Steve, would love your, I guess, your context on given that on the hard drive side of things, the capacity in the industry is pretty well rationalized, and I guess, has the potential based on cloud growth going into next year to maybe be, it sounds fantastic, but close to 100% by midyear. What implications, if any, does that then have on, I guess, the context, the tenor of your relationships with customers, your conversations with customers, business practices with customers in any regard? Would love to get your sense there and then I have a quick follow up on a different topic. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Well, yeah, and Mike can help me with this as well, but I think that one of the things that has really happened over a period of time, because as the hyperscale guys grow, and they get bigger, and as they need to add capacity and their growth is accelerating. And so you just get into, call it, the law of large numbers. We have to do a much better job working with the hyperscale guys on longer-term capacity planning. And so, we believe we've done a good job on that because we don't – they don't want to ask us for product and us not have it. And then, clearly, we don't want to gap out on them. And so, it's driven in effect a much more close-knit planning process, longer-term planning process, which the good side of that is that it allows for a little bit more predictability in terms of what's going on in that side of the business, because there was a time – well, it can still happen. But there's been conversations about the lumpiness of the business and that can still occur. But because of the dynamics that we're seeing, we're actually getting into a little bit more longer-term planning and a little bit more predictability in terms of what's happening from a demand perspective. Mike can kind of add to that. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Yeah, and I'll just sort of reiterate some of the reasons this is. So, we've talked about this long-term growth rate of 35%. We've been, as an industry, achieving that with a number of efficiency factors flowing through. We've highlighted in the past both technological as well as operational. So, technologically, things like erasure coding are widely deployed now in that infrastructure. So, the sort of efficiency gains technologically, although we expect some in the future, the largest magnitude of that has sort of run its course. The other one is operational efficiency and that underpins what Steve said. They're maturing as operational units, their ability to sort of do things like manage inventory and repurpose and reutilize their fleet. Those processes are maturing. So, really, what we now see and perhaps one of the reasons we're seeing a bias up on the exabyte growth rate is we're kind of working through those things and we're starting to approach a more natural storage deploy requirement. So that's something we'll continue to monitor and see how that trends. At this point, we'll kind of stick with 35%, but as I said, I think our bias would be up from there going forward. Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC And Steve and Mike, was sort of working more closely with those folks, would that include anything in the context of contractual alterations? Could a long-term – I'm just coming up off the top of my head, long-term contracts play into it in any context, maybe capital sharing play into it in any context, anything with financial implications? Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Well, I'll say this. I think the general view of us now as we put together this broader set of assets is we're more relevant, we're more strategically important, and our engagement is changing with the broader marketplace. So, things along those lines and other strategic things are all sort of more possible now. Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC Got it. Thanks so much. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Thank you. So, I want to thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on December 6. Have a good day.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. Our first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Unknown Speaker Hi. This is (23:19) on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on your revenue beat. I see that your net revenue is 4% ahead of your pre-announcement, which only happened last month. So what kind of linearity trends you are seeing? Did the market trends accelerate towards the back half of the quarter? Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Sure. So for the quarter, linearity was very strong. And we experienced strong demand and favorable pricing since the guidance we provided in early September. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. So if you look at it, of our revenue over-achievement from our previous guidance of $4.5 billion to the $4.7 billion, about 80% of that over-achievement was due to higher than expected demand and the balance was a bit better pricing. Unknown Speaker Okay. Great. As a follow-up, could you comment on your expectations for the NAND market bit growth as well as your bit growth? And then a bit on your expectations for pricing? Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. So talking about the current calendar year, we would expect that bit growth to be around the mid-30%, about 35% for the industry. And in our case, we had previously talked about something in the low-30% induced to some very good work by our operational teams that will be closer to the industry rate exiting this year. We'd expect next year to be in the mid-40%s, approximately 45%, both for the industry and for ourselves as we transition as an industry and we transition to 3D NAND technology. Unknown Speaker Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yeah. Thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter. As we think about building our models and you look at the variable compensation components that are included in the expectations, how should we think about variable comp going into the December quarter? And I think at one conference, you had recently noted that that will start to tail off as you realize some of the synergies from these integrations, particularly HGST. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. So the variable comp that is really driving the deltas here is our short-term bonus that's paid over a six-month horizon, as I was indicating earlier. And so for Q4, calendar Q4, we'll still have some of that effect. But as you go into calendar Q1, our fiscal Q3, that effect will be eliminated as we reset the target. And our forecast would include a normalized 100% target achievement there. So the best way to think about this normalized OpEx is that, from a calendar Q1 standpoint through to really the end of fiscal 2017, you're going to see a steady trend downward. So, first, when we talk about normalizing, we exclude the stock-based compensation. And then we bring our short-term bonus to 100%. So for the first six months of the calendar year, as we said, you'll actually be adding back some of the bonus that we didn't pay because we were below that 100% target. And for the remainder of the calendar year 2016, you would be deducting that overage, and then for the first half of calendar 2017, you would not have that short-term bonus effect. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, I'm just curious on cloud pretty universally has been cited as strong across many different companies. I'm curious beyond the December quarter how you're currently thinking about cloud demand, near-line demand, in particular going into the first half of 2017? Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. Let me just follow up and give you another data point because we're conscious of the challenges modeling some of the transitions here. But when you think about the first quarter of calendar 2017, I want to kind of give you a perspective on where the normalized OpEx should range. And a way to think about that for modeling purposes would be in the $770 million range. So, hopefully, that helped. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. So, we wanted to close off that, Aaron, and Mike can talk about cloud demand. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Perfect. Very helpful. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Sure. All right. Relative to the cloud demand capacity enterprise, specifically I noted in my prepared remarks, we saw a year-over-year increase of nearly 50%. We see this year in total running around 38% or above our long-term model of 35%. As we look into calendar 2017, we're not updating our long-term model at this point. But, we would suggest that things will run to sort of a bias up above that kind of consistent with what we're seeing this year. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Thank you. Good luck. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Mehdi Hosseini, thank you. David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Yeah, actually it's not Mehdi, it's David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini on the line. Thank you so much for taking the question. Can you guys talk about your HDD capacity in terms of units and/or exabytes? And what you've done in that regard and how that trend over the next quarters? And in that context, how we can think about capacity utilization? And I have a follow-up. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. So, this is Steve, I'll take that. So I would say that, I mean, there's a lot of dynamics that are going on in terms of our hard drive capacity because as you know, over the last kind of several years, we've been going through a manufacturing rationalization process given declines that we've seen in the hard drive market. So, there are kind of different puts and takes when you look at various different products for various different factory locations. But on balance right now in terms of hard drive manufacturing, I would say that we are kind of reasonably balanced. In other words, we're able to largely meet overall customer demand. And again, we're going to continue to rationalize this as we move forward. The one thing that we're a little bit cautious about and keeping our eye on is that, obviously when you're talking about capacity enterprise products, which, as Mike indicated, the demand in that space has been reasonably robust. And that uses a lot of heads and disks because of the platter count. And we have less flexibility both in terms of lead time and capacity in terms of heads and disks. And so as we look at that and as we watch and work closely with our customers, if for one reason or another we would see, call it, a spike from a demand perspective, our ability to meet some of that upside might be more limited. So, that's one thing that we're a bit cautious on right now. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we're at from a utilization and capacity perspective on the HDD front. David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Great. Thanks, Steve. And as a follow-up for Mark, how can we think about the cash conversion cycle, and more broadly speaking, like a normalized free cash flow rate as you've gotten your arms around the balance sheet and cash generation capability? Just any insight in how we can model that going forward. Thanks. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Sure. So from a cash conversion cycle standpoint, I think you can model basically where we've been over the last couple of quarters, but you'll have some changing dynamics. So what I would expect is inventory will likely trend up and this is really a function of us building strategic reserves as we restructure parts of our supply chain. And then eventually, you'll see the NAND parts of our business, the allocation will begin to soften and we'll begin to build more inventory. So, that will trend upwards a little bit, but you'll then I think see payables be extended from where they were in Q1. So, I think, overall, you'll see a cash conversion cycle in about the range that it's been. And in terms of the cash flow generation margin, we're actually going to have a little bit more noise in that equation for the next few quarters, primarily as a function of our restructuring and ongoing integration activities. But, one of the things we will be doing during Investor Day is providing more visibility into the dynamics of that as well as a way to think about our long-term financial modeling and the key metric around cash flow generation. David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, this is Jeriel on behalf of Amit. I just have a few questions here. Number one, can you just touch on what drove the gross margin upside? I think it was up about 60 basis points versus your positive pre and 160 basis points versus initial guide. Was this more HDD or NAND or cost integration, and some rank order would be valuable? Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. So I think as we mentioned, the favorable pricing was across both parts of our business, but primarily in the NAND area. And we did experience some additional benefits from mix, especially given the fact that we had the first full quarter of the flash product revenue. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. And also the strong performance in terms of capacity enterprise as well. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. And I mean, there's a lot of dynamics. The other thing I'd just add is that we continue to make progress in terms of our integration synergy goals. So, that continues to provide some headwind – or not headwind, tailwinds for us in terms of our margin performance. So, it was really kind of oversimplified, it was kind of a little bit of everything, kind of across the board. Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC All right. Thanks for that. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. Just to finish that thought, we would expect those same drivers to carry forward into the second fiscal quarter and that's driving the expansion of gross margin. Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC Thank you. And as a follow-up, I understand that you're only including about 45 days of that Samsung contribution, which makes sense. If or when you get a resolution with Samsung, would they back pay your payments from November 15 onwards or... Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. We would certainly hope so, yes, because the agreement expired on August 14. So when we put a new agreement in place, we would expect it to be retroactive to that date. Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC All right. Thank you so much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. James Kisner - Jefferies LLC Thank you very much. So I believe you said near-line demand was up 50% year-over-year in exabytes shipped. I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on how that translates to revenue change year-over-year, and I guess, related to that, change in price per bit year-over-year. And I guess relatedly, have you seen a more rational competitive environment for near-line and what has happened to your share in near-line quarter-on-quarter? Thanks. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. So from a translation to a revenue standpoint, it's about half that in terms of the increase in revenue. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. In terms of market dynamics, I think we think it's fairly balanced and as we expected. And I think relative to total bit participation, we think we've improved our position sequentially and we see a trend of that going forward really relative to our increasing sales of our 10 terabyte offering. James Kisner - Jefferies LLC All right. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC Thanks. Good afternoon. Just getting back to your revenue guidance for a second, I was wondering if there's any other puts and takes you can talk to in terms of how you get to the flat, either by the three business segments you've established or maybe even hopefully by some product categories as well? And then I had an enterprise follow-up question. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Sure. So let me talk about our end-markets. For datacenter devices, you can think about that whole category being roughly flat. When it comes to client devices, I think within that, while the whole category again will be roughly flat, you'll have some puts and takes. You'll see continued strength in client SSD, but we'll see gaming and, to some extent, notebook HDDs sort of come off that seasonal peak and then we'll see a little strength in desktop. When it comes to our client solutions, we actually see strength across both our HDD and flash-based products. So I think on balance, it's flat to slightly up for each of the three categories. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. The largest single variable there is that seasonality of the gaming marketplace, so that peaks, as Mark said, in calendar Q3. So that's the largest single variable within that. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC Great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, as you mentioned, you have a unique view into enterprise storage now. I was wondering if you could just compare average capacity trends between HDDs and SSDs into some of the cloud data centers that you have projects in and how the growth rates compare and contrast. Thank you very much. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Yeah, on a growth rate basis, the capacity growth rate for flash exceeds that of disk. And so that trend continues. That's been ongoing for some time and that's really specifically related to hyperscale deployments. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC Thank you. Good afternoon. Just one question for me, tagging onto that last question. So Micron, for example, has been touting its 15 terabyte drive. And I'm just interested in, may be best from Mike, how do you see the next few years playing out on the highest capacity points between hard drives and SSDs? How do you position these two? And does WD get to a point where it just is indifferent to whatever people select for cloud hyperscale environments? Thanks. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Yeah. So I think, Rich, it still begins with the workload and then the cost per bit that optimally supports that workload. So going forward, we don't see a convergence to an all-flash world anytime soon, frankly, anytime in our planning horizon. So what we do see is continued growth of capacity enterprise that we articulated. That's going be long into the future, although flash revenue and flash bits on a proportionate basis is growing faster. So from that standpoint, that's the trend we would point you to. And they have very different purposes in the hierarchy. So we continue to obviously work closely with those and are innovating around data center architectures and we intend to deploy our technology and our products in an optimal way to those trends. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC How much of a price differential is there today between the SSD version and a comparable capacity hard drive? Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. It varies depending on performance requirements, et cetera, but it would run between 5X and 10X. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc. Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. I apologize if the questions have been asked. I've been jumping between a couple calls. The first question is, can you talk a little more about next year if demand improvement in both flash and disk drives continue from an end market perspective, could we see any capacity cuts driving a shortage or a constraint issue next year from one or both segments? And the other question is around the exclusion of stock options. Can you talk a little more about the philosophy there, just given that we were aware of SanDisk and the overhang there previously, why the change now and what's the impetus? That would be great. Thank you. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Okay. Let me talk about the supply/demand environment. We said publicly and we'll reiterate here that we see constrained supply in the NAND side of our business through calendar year 2017. And that's primarily driven by two things, end market demand for that class of technology and the rate and pace of the industry's conversion to 3D NAND. Relative to the hard drive market, I think at this point we would see that as a normal or balanced environment. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. And then, Mark, with respect to the decision to exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP results, we really had two primary drivers. One was just the way we run the business. And our stock-based compensation expense actually has some elements of it that are either short term in nature or are variable. And as a result, it injects some variability that undermines our ability to demonstrate or track the improvements we're making from a synergy realization standpoint. So that's the first driver. The second driver is that we are more and more focused on our cash flow generation and looking at our results from a cash standpoint, particularly given our balance sheet. And by excluding the stock-based compensation, we are better able to highlight and track the cash flow impact of our operating decision. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Now, one thing, Mark, that I will add to that. This is Steve. Is that we fully recognize the fact that there is an impact in the form of dilution from stock-based compensation and we remain not only aware of that, but sensitive of that. And if you look at our proxy statement in terms of compensation philosophies and that sort of thing, there's no change in that regard in terms of what we're doing. It's more a matter of excluding those figures to provide more meaningful analytical information, if you want to call it that, to the financial community. But I don't want people to think that we don't recognize the fact that there is a dilution component as it relates to our existing shareholders. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. And Mark, I think as you know, part of the calculus was looking at the comparable peers. And what they do to try to provide an easier basis for comparison, so. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I know it's difficult to guide NAND gross margins since ASPs are beyond your control. But do you think your cost improvement will be above or below your long-term expectations of 20% in 2016 as you ramp 3D? And maybe, what's your expectation in 2017, calendar 2017, as 3D becomes a larger part of your mix? And I have a follow up, please. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Okay. So we've talked about sort of the cost reduction domain of kind of three generations – or three periods in the NAND industry. Very early on, it was running at around a 50% annualized rate. The next period was running at about a 30% rate. Frankly, that's now ending as we come to the conclusion of plainer NAND. As we move fully as an industry into 3D, once we're through the transition, we expect around a 20% per year cost reduction capability. So, that's the way we would guide you to think about that. Obviously, there are some perturbations as we transition from 2D to 3D, but that's the way to think about it from a long-term modeling perspective. Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC Got it. I can appreciate that. And then in the context of your bit growth outlook for calendar 2017 that you just gave and also your past comments that 3D NAND will be 40% of your overall bit output by the end of next calendar year, should we expect the majority of your 3D outlook to be 64-layer or will it be more weighted toward 48-layer? Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. It will be 64-layer. And I think we have – what's the right number for exit rate in 2017? Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. It's around 40%, but its wafers out. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Oh. Okay. So not bit output, it's just wafers out? Okay. So the 40% is wafers out. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Correct. And the other comment I'll make, just to clarify, 48-layer, we've talked about, is really a learning node for us. So, to just reiterate what Steve said, the volume as we exit next calendar year will be predominantly the 64-layer. Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC Hi, guys. Hey, congratulations and thanks for taking the question. One and then a quick follow up. Steve, would love your, I guess, your context on given that on the hard drive side of things, the capacity in the industry is pretty well rationalized, and I guess, has the potential based on cloud growth going into next year to maybe be, it sounds fantastic, but close to 100% by midyear. What implications, if any, does that then have on, I guess, the context, the tenor of your relationships with customers, your conversations with customers, business practices with customers in any regard? Would love to get your sense there and then I have a quick follow up on a different topic. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Well, yeah, and Mike can help me with this as well, but I think that one of the things that has really happened over a period of time, because as the hyperscale guys grow, and they get bigger, and as they need to add capacity and their growth is accelerating. And so you just get into, call it, the law of large numbers. We have to do a much better job working with the hyperscale guys on longer-term capacity planning. And so, we believe we've done a good job on that because we don't – they don't want to ask us for product and us not have it. And then, clearly, we don't want to gap out on them.

But there's been conversations about the lumpiness of the business and that can still occur. But because of the dynamics that we're seeing, we're actually getting into a little bit more longer-term planning and a little bit more predictability in terms of what's happening from a demand perspective. Mike can kind of add to that. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Yeah, and I'll just sort of reiterate some of the reasons this is. So, we've talked about this long-term growth rate of 35%. We've been, as an industry, achieving that with a number of efficiency factors flowing through. We've highlighted in the past both technological as well as operational. So, technologically, things like erasure coding are widely deployed now in that infrastructure. So, the sort of efficiency gains technologically, although we expect some in the future, the largest magnitude of that has sort of run its course. The other one is operational efficiency and that underpins what Steve said. They're maturing as operational units, their ability to sort of do things like manage inventory and repurpose and reutilize their fleet. Those processes are maturing. So, really, what we now see and perhaps one of the reasons we're seeing a bias up on the exabyte growth rate is we're kind of working through those things and we're starting to approach a more natural storage deploy requirement. So that's something we'll continue to monitor and see how that trends. At this point, we'll kind of stick with 35%, but as I said, I think our bias would be up from there going forward. Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC And Steve and Mike, was sort of working more closely with those folks, would that include anything in the context of contractual alterations? Could a long-term – I'm just coming up off the top of my head, long-term contracts play into it in any context, maybe capital sharing play into it in any context, anything with financial implications? Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Well, I'll say this. I think the general view of us now as we put together this broader set of assets is we're more relevant, we're more strategically important, and our engagement is changing with the broader marketplace. So, things along those lines and other strategic things are all sort of more possible now. Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC Got it. Thanks so much. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Thank you. So, I want to thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on December 6. Have a good day. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

All lines will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded, and if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead. Ken Hastings - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Christensen, President and Chief Financial Officer; Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller; and Harrie Schippers, Senior Vice President. As with prior conference calls, if there are members of the media on the line, we ask that they participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general, economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results. I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning. Thanks to the accomplishment of PACCAR's 23,000 outstanding employees around the world, 2016 was a very good year for the company. PACCAR achieved revenues of $17 billion and adjusted net income of $1.355 billion, a strong after tax return on revenues of 8%. Including the $833 million non-recurring charge with the European Commission settlement, net income was $522 million. 2016 was PACCAR's 78th consecutive year of earning a net income. Last year's results reflect the strongest European heavy truck market since 2008, and excellent operating performance in truck operations around the world. In addition, PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services generated good operating results. PACCAR celebrated many important mile – important achievements in 2016. These included market share increases of a four percentage point in both the North American and European heavy-duty truck markets, the introduction of the PACCAR MX-11 engine in North America, the launch of the PACCAR tandem axle in North America, and the introduction of the DAF Connect Telematics System in Europe. DAF's registrations in the European above 16-tonne market were a record. PACCAR invested $650 million of capital and R&D in premium quality products and services and facility enhancements to provide for future growth. PACCAR's fourth quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.1 billion, and quarterly net income was $289 million. PACCAR delivered 33,900 trucks during the fourth quarter, in line with expectations. The profitable contribution of all company segments enables PACCAR to attain the highest operating margins in our industry. PACCAR declared cash dividends of $1.56 per share last year, including a $0.60 per share special dividend declared in December. PACCAR has paid a dividend every year since 1941. During 2016, PACCAR repurchased 1.4 million shares of its stock for $71 million. PACCAR's total shareholder return was 38% in 2016 compared to 12% for the S&P 500. PACCAR shareholder return has exceeded the S&P 500 return for the previous one-year, five-year, 15-year and 20-year time periods. In the first quarter of this year, vehicle truck deliveries, vehicle deliveries and truck and other gross margins are expected to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter. Peterbilt and Kenworth achieved an excellent market share of 28.5% in the U.S. and Canadian heavy-duty truck market in 2016. Class 8 industry retail sales totaled 216,000 units the last year. And in 2017, we estimate the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market would be in a range of 190,000 units to 220,000 units. The market will be supported by estimated U.S. GDP growth of 2% to 2.5%, and industrial production growth projected at 1.5%. DAF increased its market share to 15.5% in the European above 16-tonne truck market last year compared to 14.6% in 2015. The EU heavy-truck market was a robust 303,000 units in 2016. Looking at this year, we anticipate that the European above 16-tonne truck market will be another good, it'd be in the range of 260,000 vehicles to 290,000 vehicles. Economic growth in Europe is expected to be a stable 1.5% this year. PACCAR Parts generated pre-tax profit of $544 million and revenues of $3 billion in 2016. The good results were driven by a growing population of PACCAR trucks and engines, and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts. For the fourth quarter, PACCAR Parts achieved revenues of $765 million and pre-tax income of $138 million. Fourth quarter pre-tax income was 9% higher than the fourth quarter last year on a revenue increase of 2%. We expect Parts revenues to grow 2% to 4% this year. PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $304 million in the fourth quarter and pre-tax income was $78 million. The good results benefited from the continuing strong portfolio performance. The Financial Services portfolio includes 178,000 trucks and trailers, including 38,000 PACCAR Leasing units. For the full year, PACCAR Financial Services earned pre-tax income of $307 million. For 2017, PACCAR's research and development spending of $250 million to $280 million, and capital expenditures of $375 million to $425 million, will expand Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF product offerings, enhance the PACCAR Powertrain, build on advanced driver assistance and connected truck technologies, and increase the capacity and operating efficiency of our factories and distribution centers. I'd like to recognize Bob Christensen for over 33 years of outstanding service to PACCAR. Bob is retiring tomorrow, and we wish he and his family the best. Harrie Schippers has been named Executive Vice President and CFO. I know many of you have met Harrie in the last six or seven years during his time as President of DAF Trucks and as Senior Vice President in our corporate group. As the company begins its 112th year, we're in an excellent position to lead the industry with the highest quality products and services. Thank you. I'd be pleased to answer your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Your first question will come from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Morning, Ross. Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Just a couple up front here. So first, just on the North American Class 8 market, I mean do you think orders have bottomed out at this point? And assuming that they have, if that's what you think, what quarter do you think Class 8 production bottoms out? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Well, I guess based on our view of the market, I think the inventories, backlogs are pretty well in balance, and that order intake will be indicative of production, et cetera, going forward. So I would say that based on our market size estimates of 190,000 to 220,000, that we expect that production will improve as the year progresses. Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Thank you. And just also wanted to ask you about the UK. What kind of trends did you see sequentially from Q3 to Q4 in the UK? And do you get hit on FX, importing engines from the continent or anything in particular that you would note on FX that we should consider in our models for the UK? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. So the UK market is DAF's largest market. It's been a great market. In fact, DAF set a all-time market share record in the UK market last year for the combined above 6- to 16-tonne, and above 6-tonne of 30%. So, our team has done a great job there, and we continue to see good demand from our customers. I think the economy there is good, and so there's been no indications. The movement in the pound following the Brexit vote, the movements are similar to what we've seen over the years, and while there is some headwind temporarily, that will adjust over time. Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks very much. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. You bet. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Alex. Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co. Good morning. So, I guess following up there, more broadly on Europe. Just hoping you could try to help me understand maybe a little bit what's going on in the European truck cycle. From a high level, it seems like we're still below historical peak, and RLC Corps, seems like the European fleet maybe didn't go through a true up cycle. But now, everyone's guidance seems to suggest that the cycle is maybe taking a breather before running its full course. So, I'm just wondering if maybe the macro issues there are overpowering what would otherwise be a continued upturn or if you think that the cycle actually really did run its full course. So, I guess any additional color there would be helpful. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, I think and last year, obviously, was a great year for the European truck market and DAF in particularly being able to improve its share a full percentage point in that market. If you look at the transportation statistics, the German MAUT statistics, December was another excellent month. Transport activity is at record highs across Germany, and so there's nothing near term that would say that the demand will tail off. I think we're being a bit conservative in how we view the market next year. We're actually starting the year at a higher production rate for our heavy-duty vehicles than we started last year. So, – but we're just a bit conservative in terms of how long that stays at that level. Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay, great. And then, I guess, one other one there. You've historically talked about in Europe, rolling out more Financial Services availability and expecting at least over the medium or long-term that, that would start to impact your market share in the truck segment. Just wondering the extent to which you believe that was one of the reasons behind your share gain over the last year in Europe, or whether you think the impact of the increased Financial Services is – has maybe yet to be felt and will be felt over the next couple of years. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. No, I think we're seeing – we've been open now in our Financial Services business for about two years or three years in Poland, Czech Republic, and we're seeing our share of the financing in those markets grow, and I think that also is translating into additional sales for DAF Trucks. DAF has a very strong position in the Central European countries. And so, I think as we look forward, we are looking at expanding some of our financing activities into the Romanian market. We've opened our sales subsidiary in Turkey. And so, at some point, we'll have some financing capability there. We're also, while it's not in Europe, we're also going to be opening a bank in Brazil to support the financing of trucks, DAF Trucks in Brazil. So, we continue to grow our footprint and our Finance business around the world, and it's a integral part of the model that supports our trucks in all of our markets. Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co. Interesting. Okay. Thanks very much. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Morning, Ann. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi, guys. This is Ann Duignan. I hope everybody is okay out there. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. We know you. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Yeah. Yes. You guide to U.S. and Canada per your outlook for here at this region. Could you talk a little bit about Mexico at South and what your expectations are there so that we can kind of reconcile our NAFTA outlook with your U.S., Canada? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, I think Mexico will have another good year, probably in the 20,000- to 25,000-truck range would be how we would see that market for next year. Our – we continue to be the market leader in Mexico, the Kenworth brand is very well received. We've launched our 2.1-meter product, our MX engine. So they have all the latest products, and our dealers and our customers are very excited about the prospects to continue to have a excellent business in the Mexican market. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC So, the market will be okay, but you'd expect to outperform, is that what I hear you saying? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Well, I think we know, I just think we'll continue to be at the – the market leader in the 35% to 40% share of the heavy-duty market. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Okay. Got you. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC That's good color. And then on gross margins, you had guided for full year 2017. What are you currently thinking on gross margins for 2017? It sounds like you might be a little bit more upbeat than you were at third quarter. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I'd say the range for the year would be in the 13.5% to 14.5% range, and that will sort of tie in with those market ranges that we've talked about. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC So, no change from Q3? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Okay. Yeah. No, I think that's still how we would view the year for next year. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And where do you see the biggest upside risk and the biggest downside risk? I mean I think your volumes might come in a bit better, if I'm not reading too much into what you're saying, and then where might the biggest headwinds be if – that we need to take into consideration? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I mean, typically, it's the level of demand and pricing in a given market. So, I think at the upper end of those ranges, there'll be opportunities for some pricing leverage; at the lower end, it's a competitive market, always has been and always will be. And so you just have to manage your pricing accordingly. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. I'll let it go and get back in line. Thanks. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of David Raso of Evercore ISI. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, David. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group Good morning. The truck deliveries, fourth quarter to first quarter, can you help us a bit with the geographic mix of saying up a bit sequentially? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I think it'd be up, that 1% to 2% increase in volume probably is all North America. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group Okay. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. And that just reflects additional production days. We shut our factories down during the Christmas holiday period in North America. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group Okay. Helpful. And on the gross margins, you're saying up a little bit from fourth quarter to first quarter, then the comment earlier about your U.S., Canada production sequentially improves throughout the year. So, the gross margins starting the year, make a number up, 14.1%, of the quarter was 13.9%. If you're already above the midpoint of the full-year guide and your U.S. production improves as the year goes on, why would it drag down as the year goes on? Is that a price cost comment or something about Europe we should infer from that statement? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I think it's just predicated on the market continuing to improve as the year progresses. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group But if that was the case, if you're 14.1% or so to start the year, why would the rest of the year drag you back down to 14% or, for that matter, for the low end point? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. So, as I mentioned, the range is the 13.5% to 14.5%. So there's lots of room within that range. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. You bet. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC A very good afternoon, I guess, depending on where you are. I guess just a couple questions. You mentioned to Ann, you think gross margins for the year will be 13.5% to 14.5%. But can you just comment, and I think everyone's trying to give this question specifically, what you're assuming for 2017 in terms of potential for material cost headwinds? And can price offset that specifically? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I think in terms of commodity cost, I think there is a bit of a upward trend in terms of pressure on commodity cost. But our purchasing and materials and operations teams work very closely with our suppliers. We have long-term agreements that smooth the effects of commodity cost movements, and we have a continual effort on cost reduction activities. So we don't see material cost being a significant factor in the cost of our product in 2017. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC But is price cost net positive, flat, just to be clear? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I'd say that the pricing environment in North America is probably a little more competitive in the second half of last year. As we started this year, Europe, I think is pretty flat. You just have the effects of sort of the pound-euro exchange rate that have some temporary effects. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Right. So on the margin, a little bit of a headwind, it sounds like. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, yeah. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. And then I guess my second question, can you talk about what your assumptions are on the 13-liter for market share in 2017 versus 2016, and on the 11-liter? And then last question, sorry. Obviously, energy had been – has been a headwind for the broader group. Are you seeing any signs of pickup just based on some of where your dealers are located? Could that be a potential tailwind in 2017? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. So, I think that the PACCAR engine, around that 50% mark is sort of how we see the PACCAR engines, MX-11 and MX-13. And I think there is a bit of optimism about the energy market and the opportunities for next year, but again, that's not a significant element of our total business, but... Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC And you didn't see anything in the fourth quarter or January? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. No, no. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. All right, thanks. I'll get back in queue. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Tim Thein of Citigroup. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Tim. Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Yeah. Hi. Good morning, thank you. The first question was just on the used market in North America. Maybe you could just update us in terms of what you're seeing or what you have seen with respect to pricing. And then just in terms of overall inventory levels, there has been some chatter here recently about some of the OEM groups – or I shouldn't say some, maybe one or two OEM groups holding abnormally high inventory levels. I'm just curious about your degree of confidence in the market's ability if, in fact, that's the case, to be able to kind of absorb that level of inventory. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Sure. From a pricing standpoint, if you look at today versus a year ago, prices are down about 10% for our product. We continue to maintain a premium relative to the competition in the used truck market. A lot of the trucks now that we're starting to see return and we will see return during this year will be our new 2.1-meter product, and that will even have a better value compared to some of our legacy products. So, we're actively engaged in working with our customers on lease returns, trade packages. We just opened our newest used truck facility in Chicago in December. So we're continuing to build our capabilities to handle additional volumes of used trucks. As time goes on, we're also looking at a couple of other locations during the course of this year. So we feel very comfortable with our ability to handle the volume of trucks that we're seeing in our inventory and will be coming back to us during the course of 2017. Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Got it. In that 10%, I know there are some quite big spreads between wholesale and retail, but would you – what would you put for the market, closer to 20%, in terms of year-over-year, and adjusting for model years and everything? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. All I know is our product and our prices. Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Yeah. Okay, fair enough. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. And that average is 10%. Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. For – okay. And then just on the raw material question, can you update us, I know that you had done some work in a factory a couple years ago in terms of some of the basically engineering out some cost. And I believe you were about two-thirds of production, North America had moved to that kind of updated model. Is that where we sit today? I'm just curious if there is more room to effectively increase that, those production of the models that, yeah. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. Part of our R&D budget last year, this year, will just be continued to enhance the product offerings of our 2.1-meter product line. And so it's 70%, 75% of what we do today, and it will continue to grow as the years progress. So, the favorable benefits of that will continue to be recognized. Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thanks a lot. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Steven Fisher of UBS. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC Thanks. Good morning. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC Good morning. Wondering what your outlook is for Parts margins from here. And I think the theory was that the more of your own engines you have out there and the more they're aging, the margin mix of your Parts business should start to get more robust. But where are you in that process? Because it looks like the margins have maybe leveled off a little bit. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. If you look back over a two or three year period, the margins in our Parts business have progressed nicely. And so, it depends a lot any given time on the mix of parts that you sell, et cetera. And we expect the percentage of engine parts to continue to grow gradually over time, and I think that will have a positive impact on margin percentages. The other side of that is we're also growing and expanding our TRP capability. We ended the year with 77 independent TRP stores owned by our dealers. Those parts carry a lower margin, but they also give us additional volume, additional contact with additional customers, and is a great initiative that's really been a key focus of our dealers to take advantage of that opportunity to grow their presence in their market. So I think that there is a balance of puts and takes there. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC So do you think that adds up to a higher Parts margin in 2017 versus 2016? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. The effects are going to be, I think, nominal. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC Okay. And then the Financial Services sequential profit improvement reversed a four-quarter slide. Were there any one-time benefits, and how should we think about the trajectory of Financial Services profit in 2017? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. As we look at 2017, I think the portfolio balance will be comparable to where it has been. A lot of the variations in profitability over the last eight quarters had been tied to used truck movements. And so, used trucks will play a significant part in how the profitability of the Financial Services segment performs in 2017. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC So the fact that it's showing improvement, do you think that's also a reflection of the more balanced used market? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I think there's, yeah, I that's a key element of it, and when you recognize the impact of lower used truck prices on your portfolio. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. I'm wondering if you could talk about the impact of dealer inventory destock on your Parts business in 2016. I think over the past couple of quarters, you mentioned that some dealers had reduced inventories. And now that the new order picture is clearing up, I'm wondering if we could see some inventory stocking in 2017. Can you just frame the order of magnitude for us? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, our dealer inventories have been in great shape, really, throughout 2016 and as we enter 2017. If anything, our dealers probably could use a few more trucks, and we're seeing some good orders early on in 2017 for inventory. So, I think the Parts impact of that is, I mean, it's sort of business as usual. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. And I'm wondering if you could talk about how far out your lead times extend in Europe. You spoke about starting the year at higher build rates than a year ago. How much visibility do you have? What was book-to-bill in the fourth quarter, if you're willing to share it, for Europe specifically? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, I'd just say our backlogs are in excellent shape all around the world in all of our businesses, and Europe is right in line with that. So we're very comfortable with our backlogs, and they're really balanced in with order intake and demand in the markets right now. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. And on pricing, in the 10-Q for last quarter, Mexico was a significant headwind. I'm wondering if you can talk about, is that continuing? Is that what you alluded to in the prior Q&A as a headwind in North America, and how much of that is currency driven? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. One more time, Jerry? I missed the first part. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. The pricing situation in Mexico. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Okay. Sure. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. So, you just talked about a significant headwind in the third quarter 10-Q, and I'm wondering, is that situation continuing into the first quarter here? And would you attribute that to the currency moves, and any other color you can give us on what's playing out on that market from a pricing standpoint? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I wouldn't – I don't know if we said significant headwind, that doesn't make sense to me. But with the depreciating peso, that's a – it's a competitive market. And so you – we try to – we basically sell in U.S. dollars. So, we've got to work with customers to balance their ability to invest in new equipment and our ability to sell it at a fair price. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. And so, if the currency continues to move in the direction it's been trending up over the past, call it, one quarter to two quarters, do you have any opportunities to mitigate the currency impact on your sales into Mexico, maybe a small assembly operation, anything along those lines we should be thinking about? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. We produce, for Mexico, we produce all of our trucks in Mexico. So, we don't have cross-border matters to deal with there. So, but a lot of the components come from U.S. suppliers, as they always have. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. All right. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of David Leiker of Robert W. Baird. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Morning, David. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hey, this is actually Joe for David. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Joe. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. You've been giving order share in the U.S., Canada market in recent quarters. Is it possible to get an update of maybe where that was during Q4? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, so for the full year, Peterbilt and Kenworth were at 32% share of the order intake, and I think for the fourth quarter, just under 30% in the fourth quarter. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay. So, given share has been so high recently, and I think you've talked in the past, it's a competitive market, it's tough to maintain such a magnitude of a jump that PACCAR has seen, are you seeing maybe greater inroads? And thinking about the 2017 environment, particularly the two European OEMs entered 2016 with very high inventory, maybe they start to come back a bit? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Our guys – we have great products, and I think the market has always recognized the premium value of Kenworth and Peterbilt in North America, and DAF in Europe, and our teams are working hard to sell those great products. It's a premium value at a premium price, and not everybody is willing to pay that, but we've grown our share over time in both markets, and our goal is to continue to increment share as we progress over the coming years. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. And then maybe a similar conversation in Europe, I think what people might be trying to figure out is an industry forecast, minus 9% in 2017, you're going to start up. It sounds like you started to see some softening in particular countries as the UK softened at year-end. And so, is that difference between DAF and the industry, just your order intake and your backlog, and that's what's driving it? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I think our market assumption, as I mentioned previously, is probably a bit conservative based on where we're at currently, but the UK market has been pretty steady. And we've gotten good orders this year into the UK and all of our markets around the market. So I think we're in good shape as we enter 2017. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay, great. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Deblase from Deutsche Bank. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Nicole. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah. So my first question is just around, I guess, the tone of conversations that you're having with dealers and customers in the U.S. Just we've got improvement in the PMIs and it feels like general business sentiment is getting better. So just curious if you're seeing that reflected in your conversations with dealers and customers as well. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Well, I might let Bob address that for North America and let Harrie comment on the Europe situation. Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc. I think that's a correct assessment, that the tone of conversations is generally positive. We just came back from the American Truck Dealers meeting in New Orleans this past weekend, and I would say dealers are looking optimistically towards the year. Quote activity seems to be normalized, and it should be a very good year for the truck industry once again in 2017. Harrie C. A. M. Schippers - PACCAR, Inc. And in Europe, I think I can confirm that business and industry confidence levels are at high levels. Freight, like Ron mentioned, is at good strong levels, and as a result, our order and backlog is in good shape. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Great. Thanks. And this one is kind of nitpicky, but I'm getting to the bottom of my question list here. Just why did you guys opt to cut R&D guidance for 2017? Is there anything significant there? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Nothing significant. As we dialed in our budgets for next year and looked at our product plans, that's the amount we need to continue to support the product and build our business. So, I think we are very – just a little bit sharpening of the pencil, as I say. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Got it. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Andy. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hey, good morning and afternoon. And good luck, Bob. Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC You're welcome. So, not sure if you guys mentioned this already, but can you share any change in the order activity? I know in Europe, I know Harrie just talked about it being in good shape. Was that up, down or flat? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I think when you compare orders, Harrie, I mean, you've got some information in terms of the fourth quarter of this year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year? Harrie C. A. M. Schippers - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, the total order intake for DAF in the fourth quarter in the heavy segment was up 19% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 2015. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. And then, rest of world volume has been steadily growing through 2016. Can you give a little color as to what regions were driving that? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Well, we continue to increment our build in Brazil. It's a difficult market, but our team is step-by-step increasing production and increasing their market share, and Mexico was – a good year for Mexico. Australia, the mining sector is – has slowed, but we just launched our new T610 product in Australia, and their backlog is starting off very strong and we'll be looking at some build rate increases in Australia in the coming weeks. And we are seeing some increasing demand in markets like Russia, that the demand for Euro 5 vehicles is increasing, and DAF is doing a good job of getting their share of that additional demand in Russia. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC That's good news. Thank you very much. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Seth. Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, good morning and good afternoon. I just wanted to go – a couple quick questions. On Brazil, you mentioned that the market is obviously still tough, but your volumes are increasing and your absorption should be getting better. Is there a kind of a critical mass that we should be thinking about for that region or for your production where, I don't know if you'll comment or not, but is that facility breakeven for you or profitable for you today, or can that sort of flip from losing money to making money any time soon, if you can comment on that? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I think a lot – just it all really depends on the economic developments in the country. And we've seen two years of contraction of over 3%, the expectations for this year is more of a flat development, but the Brazilian economy and the Brazilian – the Brazilians have a lot going for them in terms of resources, agricultural capability. So I think we feel very comfortable long-term with our investment, and as time goes on, it will provide a good return to our shareholders. Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC But at current levels, though, it's still a drag to you? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. It is, yes. Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. And then just, I guess, a follow-up question. As production volumes get better just across the company or North America, I guess, kind of given the puts and takes around material cost and things like that, is there an incremental margin that you're comfortable talking to as volumes get better? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I think if you just look at the history of incremental and decremental margins, I think that's how you should think about us going forward. Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC So something like the 20% range or so? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, exactly. Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mike Shlisky of Seaport Global. Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC Good morning, guys. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning. Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC Just following up on Seth's question about Brazil. Does opening a bank in Brazil help you ramp up the market share penetration? It's been roughly 1% a year for a couple years now. Does it make it any more of a positive tailwind on that, either 2017 or 2018? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yes. For sure, it does, and that's our whole drive behind our finance business, is profitably supporting the sale of PACCAR products around the world, and Brazil is no different. And as we have that financing capability, that will enhance DAF's ability to sell to more customers in the Brazilian market. Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC So, if you have been getting about 1% a year, could you maybe get you to 2% a year of additional share going forward? Just kind of help us to quantify the upside here. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I can't really comment on that. I think there's some benefit there. We've been able to get that share here. The product is performing great. We have a great team that represents the DAF brand in the market. And I'm totally confident that we'll continue to grow our share, whatever pace that might be, and that, yeah, the finance company, all other things being equal, will enhance that share growth. Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC Okay, great. And then secondly, I saw on your issue, you've got a Toronto Parts DC opening. Is that going to open in 2017? And would that be serving? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. No, it will probably be a mid 2018. We're just finalizing the purchase of the land and there will be a permitting process, and so construction will start probably mid-year this year and then finalize mid-year 2018. Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC Is that going to serve just Canada or will it also serve the Eastern U.S.? And I was curious as to what kind of operation you are placing there. Is that going to be a good margin efficiency improvement like we saw in Renton this year? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Well, I was just in that, our current Toronto Distribution Center about two weeks ago, and the team does a great job in a 55,000-square-foot facility. This will triple the amount of space. We have a growing business, both our dealers and our customers in that area, and this will allow them to grow their parts business in that area and better support a growing base of customers. So, just you saw us build the Renton PDC this last year, which doubled the amount of square footage. We expanded our PDC in Lancaster in Pennsylvania, that really supports the Northeastern part of the U.S. We have a Distribution Center in Montréal that supports customers in Québec. So, this particular PDC is primarily focused on the Ontario area and Middle Canada. Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC Perfect. Thank you very much. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Neil Frohnapple of Longbow Research. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Neil. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC Thanks. Yeah. I believe a few years ago, you indicated that Kenworth and Peterbilt U.S. and Canada Class 8 vocational truck share was above 40%. Is that still the case today? And I guess as a follow-up, could you just talk about order activity for the segment in the market and the prospects from higher infrastructure spending potentially coming in 2018? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, I think that share position is still about right. In terms of demand in that arena, I think demand has been pretty consistent. And for sure, if there is substantial infrastructure investment, I think that would bode well for our ability to sell more trucks into that segment. So, the Peterbilt and Kenworth products do great in that area. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC Okay. Could you also talk about your industry outlook for the U.S. and Canada in medium-duty market versus 2016, whether you expect that to be flat, up or down? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I think fairly flat. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC Great. Thanks a lot. Congrats, Bob. Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Robert Wertheimer of Barclays. Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Good morning. Could you talk about, you mentioned Russia earlier, where are we versus peak in Russia and what's the outlook for the next two, three years, I mean, gradual strengthening your return? And maybe just a second comment, we have data on used truck pricing, which you alluded to in the North American market. What is European used truck pricing like, up or down or flat? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, I'd say European used truck pricing is relatively flat. In terms of the Russian market, we're probably still on the ascent in terms of a couple years ago, the market was stronger. DAF sold about 3,000 trucks into Russia. Last year, it was just under 1,000 trucks. And so, there is good upward trend, but certainly more upside potential. Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc. Great. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Sam Rathod of Macquarie. Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Hi. Good mooning. Sameer Rathod. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning. Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. There has been a lot of discussion by the current administration about reducing regulation, including environmental. Do you think this is a net positive or negative for intermediate truck demand? Because on one hand, you have newer standards historically helping driving replacement cycles, on the other hand, reduced regulation may spur business activity. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. We're preparing for the regulations as they exist currently. It's difficult to plan based on speculation, and so we're developing our products for the future, following the greenhouse gas regulations that are in place. So, if those change, we will reevaluate our plans and adapt accordingly. Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Okay. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC Hey. Thanks. Morning, guys. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC So can you share the – sorry, if I missed it, what you're expecting for Parts revenue growth this year and Financial Services margins? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. So Parts revenue growth, I indicated we expect 2017 to be 2% to 4% growth rate. Financial Services margins, I think were – probably see our spreads be relatively steady, and I think a big factor in the results would be the movement of used truck values, but our portfolio in our Finance business is performing excellently. Our team generated a share of 26% of all PACCAR products sold that they financed last year. And so the finance team continues to manage their business in a very prudent way, and generate a good contribution to PACCAR's results. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. And then, just secondly, can you just talk about the percent of your U.S. cost of goods sold that are imported into the U.S.? And then maybe just broadly, how you're thinking about any potential changes you might want to make if we get a border adjustment tax? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. That's – a lot of speculation on trade matters, and so we'll address those as they come at us. We source materials from all over the world, majority out of the U.S., I don't know what that percentage might be. But we're – we source just as all the automotive and commercial vehicle industry does. So whatever the effects might be for us would be similar for the industry. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC So you're saying that you don't want to give a number in terms of how much of your U.S. cost of goods are imported, but you're saying you wouldn't think it's any different than any other OEM? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I don't think it's any different. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator And your final question comes from the line of Joel Tiss of BMO. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Last and least, I'm used to that. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Hey. The best for last with Joel. That's how I look at it. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Yeah. Something like that. And then, so just there's been a lot of questions, so I'll make it quick. But the fourth quarter, the drop-off in the gross margin and the profitability is really just from end of year adjusting inventory, cleaning out, whatever, getting rid of some new unused product, and feeling some of the pricing pressure that's been evident in the market to set up for 201. Is that fair? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I think there is a bit of competitive pricing pressure, the pound-euro exchange rate had some effect. In our fourth quarter, we typically will do some projects in our factories, so we have some maintenance projects that we do over the shutdown period. And so just normal stuff, so nothing unusual. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And then there was a slide from your December presentation that you – it suggested at least that you're going to capture some parts sales from the more technologically advanced stuff, like adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning system. Can you give me a sense of how can you do that? Those are someone else's – those are mostly someone else's parts. And so, I just – I don't know, it's hard for me to understand that. But I'm not the brightest guy in the planet either. Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc. So, Joel, we sell a combination of our captive parts, as well as vendor supplied parts that we bring into our warehouse and have available for dealers. We manage that dealer inventory, and as parts for those systems are consumed at retail, then we will resupply the dealer from our warehouses. But we have access to all parts that are used on PACCAR products around the world. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. So, just maybe a little bit less markup just because there is more hands touching it or something like that? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, I think that's fair. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. All right. I'm not getting back in queue. Thank you very much. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Joel, always good to talk to you. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States) All right, see you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Bye. Operator There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company? Ken Hastings - PACCAR, Inc. We would like to thank everyone for their participation, and thank you, operator.

Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Morning, Ross. Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Just a couple up front here. So first, just on the North American Class 8 market, I mean do you think orders have bottomed out at this point? And assuming that they have, if that's what you think, what quarter do you think Class 8 production bottoms out? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Well, I guess based on our view of the market, I think the inventories, backlogs are pretty well in balance, and that order intake will be indicative of production, et cetera, going forward. So I would say that based on our market size estimates of 190,000 to 220,000, that we expect that production will improve as the year progresses. Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Thank you. And just also wanted to ask you about the UK. What kind of trends did you see sequentially from Q3 to Q4 in the UK? And do you get hit on FX, importing engines from the continent or anything in particular that you would note on FX that we should consider in our models for the UK? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. So the UK market is DAF's largest market. It's been a great market. In fact, DAF set a all-time market share record in the UK market last year for the combined above 6- to 16-tonne, and above 6-tonne of 30%. So, our team has done a great job there, and we continue to see good demand from our customers. I think the economy there is good, and so there's been no indications. The movement in the pound following the Brexit vote, the movements are similar to what we've seen over the years, and while there is some headwind temporarily, that will adjust over time. Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks very much. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. You bet. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Alex. Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co. Good morning. So, I guess following up there, more broadly on Europe. Just hoping you could try to help me understand maybe a little bit what's going on in the European truck cycle. From a high level, it seems like we're still below historical peak, and RLC Corps, seems like the European fleet maybe didn't go through a true up cycle. But now, everyone's guidance seems to suggest that the cycle is maybe taking a breather before running its full course. So, I'm just wondering if maybe the macro issues there are overpowering what would otherwise be a continued upturn or if you think that the cycle actually really did run its full course. So, I guess any additional color there would be helpful. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, I think and last year, obviously, was a great year for the European truck market and DAF in particularly being able to improve its share a full percentage point in that market. If you look at the transportation statistics, the German MAUT statistics, December was another excellent month. Transport activity is at record highs across Germany, and so there's nothing near term that would say that the demand will tail off. I think we're being a bit conservative in how we view the market next year. We're actually starting the year at a higher production rate for our heavy-duty vehicles than we started last year. So, – but we're just a bit conservative in terms of how long that stays at that level. Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay, great. And then, I guess, one other one there. You've historically talked about in Europe, rolling out more Financial Services availability and expecting at least over the medium or long-term that, that would start to impact your market share in the truck segment. Just wondering the extent to which you believe that was one of the reasons behind your share gain over the last year in Europe, or whether you think the impact of the increased Financial Services is – has maybe yet to be felt and will be felt over the next couple of years. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. No, I think we're seeing – we've been open now in our Financial Services business for about two years or three years in Poland, Czech Republic, and we're seeing our share of the financing in those markets grow, and I think that also is translating into additional sales for DAF Trucks. DAF has a very strong position in the Central European countries. And so, I think as we look forward, we are looking at expanding some of our financing activities into the Romanian market. We've opened our sales subsidiary in Turkey. And so, at some point, we'll have some financing capability there. We're also, while it's not in Europe, we're also going to be opening a bank in Brazil to support the financing of trucks, DAF Trucks in Brazil. So, we continue to grow our footprint and our Finance business around the world, and it's a integral part of the model that supports our trucks in all of our markets. Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co. Interesting. Okay. Thanks very much. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Morning, Ann. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi, guys. This is Ann Duignan. I hope everybody is okay out there. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. We know you. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Yeah. Yes. You guide to U.S. and Canada per your outlook for here at this region. Could you talk a little bit about Mexico at South and what your expectations are there so that we can kind of reconcile our NAFTA outlook with your U.S., Canada? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, I think Mexico will have another good year, probably in the 20,000- to 25,000-truck range would be how we would see that market for next year. Our – we continue to be the market leader in Mexico, the Kenworth brand is very well received. We've launched our 2.1-meter product, our MX engine. So they have all the latest products, and our dealers and our customers are very excited about the prospects to continue to have a excellent business in the Mexican market. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC So, the market will be okay, but you'd expect to outperform, is that what I hear you saying? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Well, I think we know, I just think we'll continue to be at the – the market leader in the 35% to 40% share of the heavy-duty market. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Okay. Got you. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC That's good color. And then on gross margins, you had guided for full year 2017. What are you currently thinking on gross margins for 2017? It sounds like you might be a little bit more upbeat than you were at third quarter. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I'd say the range for the year would be in the 13.5% to 14.5% range, and that will sort of tie in with those market ranges that we've talked about. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC So, no change from Q3? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Okay. Yeah. No, I think that's still how we would view the year for next year. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And where do you see the biggest upside risk and the biggest downside risk? I mean I think your volumes might come in a bit better, if I'm not reading too much into what you're saying, and then where might the biggest headwinds be if – that we need to take into consideration? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I mean, typically, it's the level of demand and pricing in a given market. So, I think at the upper end of those ranges, there'll be opportunities for some pricing leverage; at the lower end, it's a competitive market, always has been and always will be. And so you just have to manage your pricing accordingly. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. I'll let it go and get back in line. Thanks. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of David Raso of Evercore ISI. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, David. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group Good morning. The truck deliveries, fourth quarter to first quarter, can you help us a bit with the geographic mix of saying up a bit sequentially? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I think it'd be up, that 1% to 2% increase in volume probably is all North America. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group Okay. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. And that just reflects additional production days. We shut our factories down during the Christmas holiday period in North America. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group Okay. Helpful. And on the gross margins, you're saying up a little bit from fourth quarter to first quarter, then the comment earlier about your U.S., Canada production sequentially improves throughout the year. So, the gross margins starting the year, make a number up, 14.1%, of the quarter was 13.9%. If you're already above the midpoint of the full-year guide and your U.S. production improves as the year goes on, why would it drag down as the year goes on? Is that a price cost comment or something about Europe we should infer from that statement? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I think it's just predicated on the market continuing to improve as the year progresses. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group But if that was the case, if you're 14.1% or so to start the year, why would the rest of the year drag you back down to 14% or, for that matter, for the low end point? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. So, as I mentioned, the range is the 13.5% to 14.5%. So there's lots of room within that range. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. You bet. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC A very good afternoon, I guess, depending on where you are. I guess just a couple questions. You mentioned to Ann, you think gross margins for the year will be 13.5% to 14.5%. But can you just comment, and I think everyone's trying to give this question specifically, what you're assuming for 2017 in terms of potential for material cost headwinds? And can price offset that specifically? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I think in terms of commodity cost, I think there is a bit of a upward trend in terms of pressure on commodity cost. But our purchasing and materials and operations teams work very closely with our suppliers. We have long-term agreements that smooth the effects of commodity cost movements, and we have a continual effort on cost reduction activities. So we don't see material cost being a significant factor in the cost of our product in 2017. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC But is price cost net positive, flat, just to be clear? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I'd say that the pricing environment in North America is probably a little more competitive in the second half of last year. As we started this year, Europe, I think is pretty flat. You just have the effects of sort of the pound-euro exchange rate that have some temporary effects. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Right. So on the margin, a little bit of a headwind, it sounds like. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, yeah. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. And then I guess my second question, can you talk about what your assumptions are on the 13-liter for market share in 2017 versus 2016, and on the 11-liter? And then last question, sorry. Obviously, energy had been – has been a headwind for the broader group. Are you seeing any signs of pickup just based on some of where your dealers are located? Could that be a potential tailwind in 2017? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. So, I think that the PACCAR engine, around that 50% mark is sort of how we see the PACCAR engines, MX-11 and MX-13. And I think there is a bit of optimism about the energy market and the opportunities for next year, but again, that's not a significant element of our total business, but... Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC And you didn't see anything in the fourth quarter or January? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. No, no. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. All right, thanks. I'll get back in queue. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Tim Thein of Citigroup. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Tim. Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Yeah. Hi. Good morning, thank you. The first question was just on the used market in North America. Maybe you could just update us in terms of what you're seeing or what you have seen with respect to pricing. And then just in terms of overall inventory levels, there has been some chatter here recently about some of the OEM groups – or I shouldn't say some, maybe one or two OEM groups holding abnormally high inventory levels. I'm just curious about your degree of confidence in the market's ability if, in fact, that's the case, to be able to kind of absorb that level of inventory. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Sure. From a pricing standpoint, if you look at today versus a year ago, prices are down about 10% for our product. We continue to maintain a premium relative to the competition in the used truck market. A lot of the trucks now that we're starting to see return and we will see return during this year will be our new 2.1-meter product, and that will even have a better value compared to some of our legacy products. So, we're actively engaged in working with our customers on lease returns, trade packages. We just opened our newest used truck facility in Chicago in December. So we're continuing to build our capabilities to handle additional volumes of used trucks. As time goes on, we're also looking at a couple of other locations during the course of this year. So we feel very comfortable with our ability to handle the volume of trucks that we're seeing in our inventory and will be coming back to us during the course of 2017. Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Got it. In that 10%, I know there are some quite big spreads between wholesale and retail, but would you – what would you put for the market, closer to 20%, in terms of year-over-year, and adjusting for model years and everything? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. All I know is our product and our prices. Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Yeah. Okay, fair enough. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. And that average is 10%. Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. For – okay. And then just on the raw material question, can you update us, I know that you had done some work in a factory a couple years ago in terms of some of the basically engineering out some cost. And I believe you were about two-thirds of production, North America had moved to that kind of updated model. Is that where we sit today? I'm just curious if there is more room to effectively increase that, those production of the models that, yeah. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. Part of our R&D budget last year, this year, will just be continued to enhance the product offerings of our 2.1-meter product line. And so it's 70%, 75% of what we do today, and it will continue to grow as the years progress. So, the favorable benefits of that will continue to be recognized. Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thanks a lot. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Steven Fisher of UBS. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC Thanks. Good morning. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC Good morning. Wondering what your outlook is for Parts margins from here. And I think the theory was that the more of your own engines you have out there and the more they're aging, the margin mix of your Parts business should start to get more robust. But where are you in that process? Because it looks like the margins have maybe leveled off a little bit. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. If you look back over a two or three year period, the margins in our Parts business have progressed nicely. And so, it depends a lot any given time on the mix of parts that you sell, et cetera. And we expect the percentage of engine parts to continue to grow gradually over time, and I think that will have a positive impact on margin percentages. The other side of that is we're also growing and expanding our TRP capability. We ended the year with 77 independent TRP stores owned by our dealers. Those parts carry a lower margin, but they also give us additional volume, additional contact with additional customers, and is a great initiative that's really been a key focus of our dealers to take advantage of that opportunity to grow their presence in their market. So I think that there is a balance of puts and takes there. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC So do you think that adds up to a higher Parts margin in 2017 versus 2016? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. The effects are going to be, I think, nominal. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC Okay. And then the Financial Services sequential profit improvement reversed a four-quarter slide. Were there any one-time benefits, and how should we think about the trajectory of Financial Services profit in 2017? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. As we look at 2017, I think the portfolio balance will be comparable to where it has been. A lot of the variations in profitability over the last eight quarters had been tied to used truck movements. And so, used trucks will play a significant part in how the profitability of the Financial Services segment performs in 2017. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC So the fact that it's showing improvement, do you think that's also a reflection of the more balanced used market? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I think there's, yeah, I that's a key element of it, and when you recognize the impact of lower used truck prices on your portfolio. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. I'm wondering if you could talk about the impact of dealer inventory destock on your Parts business in 2016. I think over the past couple of quarters, you mentioned that some dealers had reduced inventories. And now that the new order picture is clearing up, I'm wondering if we could see some inventory stocking in 2017. Can you just frame the order of magnitude for us? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, our dealer inventories have been in great shape, really, throughout 2016 and as we enter 2017. If anything, our dealers probably could use a few more trucks, and we're seeing some good orders early on in 2017 for inventory. So, I think the Parts impact of that is, I mean, it's sort of business as usual. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. And I'm wondering if you could talk about how far out your lead times extend in Europe. You spoke about starting the year at higher build rates than a year ago. How much visibility do you have? What was book-to-bill in the fourth quarter, if you're willing to share it, for Europe specifically? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, I'd just say our backlogs are in excellent shape all around the world in all of our businesses, and Europe is right in line with that. So we're very comfortable with our backlogs, and they're really balanced in with order intake and demand in the markets right now. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. And on pricing, in the 10-Q for last quarter, Mexico was a significant headwind. I'm wondering if you can talk about, is that continuing? Is that what you alluded to in the prior Q&A as a headwind in North America, and how much of that is currency driven? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. One more time, Jerry? I missed the first part. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. The pricing situation in Mexico. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Okay. Sure. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. So, you just talked about a significant headwind in the third quarter 10-Q, and I'm wondering, is that situation continuing into the first quarter here? And would you attribute that to the currency moves, and any other color you can give us on what's playing out on that market from a pricing standpoint? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I wouldn't – I don't know if we said significant headwind, that doesn't make sense to me. But with the depreciating peso, that's a – it's a competitive market. And so you – we try to – we basically sell in U.S. dollars. So, we've got to work with customers to balance their ability to invest in new equipment and our ability to sell it at a fair price. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. And so, if the currency continues to move in the direction it's been trending up over the past, call it, one quarter to two quarters, do you have any opportunities to mitigate the currency impact on your sales into Mexico, maybe a small assembly operation, anything along those lines we should be thinking about? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. We produce, for Mexico, we produce all of our trucks in Mexico. So, we don't have cross-border matters to deal with there. So, but a lot of the components come from U.S. suppliers, as they always have. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. All right. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of David Leiker of Robert W. Baird. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Morning, David. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hey, this is actually Joe for David. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Joe. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. You've been giving order share in the U.S., Canada market in recent quarters. Is it possible to get an update of maybe where that was during Q4? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, so for the full year, Peterbilt and Kenworth were at 32% share of the order intake, and I think for the fourth quarter, just under 30% in the fourth quarter. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay. So, given share has been so high recently, and I think you've talked in the past, it's a competitive market, it's tough to maintain such a magnitude of a jump that PACCAR has seen, are you seeing maybe greater inroads? And thinking about the 2017 environment, particularly the two European OEMs entered 2016 with very high inventory, maybe they start to come back a bit? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Our guys – we have great products, and I think the market has always recognized the premium value of Kenworth and Peterbilt in North America, and DAF in Europe, and our teams are working hard to sell those great products. It's a premium value at a premium price, and not everybody is willing to pay that, but we've grown our share over time in both markets, and our goal is to continue to increment share as we progress over the coming years. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. And then maybe a similar conversation in Europe, I think what people might be trying to figure out is an industry forecast, minus 9% in 2017, you're going to start up. It sounds like you started to see some softening in particular countries as the UK softened at year-end. And so, is that difference between DAF and the industry, just your order intake and your backlog, and that's what's driving it? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I think our market assumption, as I mentioned previously, is probably a bit conservative based on where we're at currently, but the UK market has been pretty steady. And we've gotten good orders this year into the UK and all of our markets around the market. So I think we're in good shape as we enter 2017. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay, great. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Deblase from Deutsche Bank. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Nicole. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah. So my first question is just around, I guess, the tone of conversations that you're having with dealers and customers in the U.S. Just we've got improvement in the PMIs and it feels like general business sentiment is getting better. So just curious if you're seeing that reflected in your conversations with dealers and customers as well. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Well, I might let Bob address that for North America and let Harrie comment on the Europe situation. Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc. I think that's a correct assessment, that the tone of conversations is generally positive. We just came back from the American Truck Dealers meeting in New Orleans this past weekend, and I would say dealers are looking optimistically towards the year. Quote activity seems to be normalized, and it should be a very good year for the truck industry once again in 2017. Harrie C. A. M. Schippers - PACCAR, Inc. And in Europe, I think I can confirm that business and industry confidence levels are at high levels. Freight, like Ron mentioned, is at good strong levels, and as a result, our order and backlog is in good shape. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Great. Thanks. And this one is kind of nitpicky, but I'm getting to the bottom of my question list here. Just why did you guys opt to cut R&D guidance for 2017? Is there anything significant there? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Nothing significant. As we dialed in our budgets for next year and looked at our product plans, that's the amount we need to continue to support the product and build our business. So, I think we are very – just a little bit sharpening of the pencil, as I say. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Got it. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Andy. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hey, good morning and afternoon. And good luck, Bob. Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC You're welcome. So, not sure if you guys mentioned this already, but can you share any change in the order activity? I know in Europe, I know Harrie just talked about it being in good shape. Was that up, down or flat? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I think when you compare orders, Harrie, I mean, you've got some information in terms of the fourth quarter of this year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year? Harrie C. A. M. Schippers - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, the total order intake for DAF in the fourth quarter in the heavy segment was up 19% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 2015. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. And then, rest of world volume has been steadily growing through 2016. Can you give a little color as to what regions were driving that? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Well, we continue to increment our build in Brazil. It's a difficult market, but our team is step-by-step increasing production and increasing their market share, and Mexico was – a good year for Mexico. Australia, the mining sector is – has slowed, but we just launched our new T610 product in Australia, and their backlog is starting off very strong and we'll be looking at some build rate increases in Australia in the coming weeks. And we are seeing some increasing demand in markets like Russia, that the demand for Euro 5 vehicles is increasing, and DAF is doing a good job of getting their share of that additional demand in Russia. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC That's good news. Thank you very much. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Seth. Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, good morning and good afternoon. I just wanted to go – a couple quick questions. On Brazil, you mentioned that the market is obviously still tough, but your volumes are increasing and your absorption should be getting better. Is there a kind of a critical mass that we should be thinking about for that region or for your production where, I don't know if you'll comment or not, but is that facility breakeven for you or profitable for you today, or can that sort of flip from losing money to making money any time soon, if you can comment on that? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I think a lot – just it all really depends on the economic developments in the country. And we've seen two years of contraction of over 3%, the expectations for this year is more of a flat development, but the Brazilian economy and the Brazilian – the Brazilians have a lot going for them in terms of resources, agricultural capability. So I think we feel very comfortable long-term with our investment, and as time goes on, it will provide a good return to our shareholders. Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC But at current levels, though, it's still a drag to you? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. It is, yes. Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. And then just, I guess, a follow-up question. As production volumes get better just across the company or North America, I guess, kind of given the puts and takes around material cost and things like that, is there an incremental margin that you're comfortable talking to as volumes get better? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I think if you just look at the history of incremental and decremental margins, I think that's how you should think about us going forward. Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC So something like the 20% range or so? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, exactly. Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mike Shlisky of Seaport Global. Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC Good morning, guys. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning. Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC Just following up on Seth's question about Brazil. Does opening a bank in Brazil help you ramp up the market share penetration? It's been roughly 1% a year for a couple years now. Does it make it any more of a positive tailwind on that, either 2017 or 2018? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yes. For sure, it does, and that's our whole drive behind our finance business, is profitably supporting the sale of PACCAR products around the world, and Brazil is no different. And as we have that financing capability, that will enhance DAF's ability to sell to more customers in the Brazilian market. Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC So, if you have been getting about 1% a year, could you maybe get you to 2% a year of additional share going forward? Just kind of help us to quantify the upside here. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I can't really comment on that. I think there's some benefit there. We've been able to get that share here. The product is performing great. We have a great team that represents the DAF brand in the market. And I'm totally confident that we'll continue to grow our share, whatever pace that might be, and that, yeah, the finance company, all other things being equal, will enhance that share growth. Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC Okay, great. And then secondly, I saw on your issue, you've got a Toronto Parts DC opening. Is that going to open in 2017? And would that be serving? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. No, it will probably be a mid 2018. We're just finalizing the purchase of the land and there will be a permitting process, and so construction will start probably mid-year this year and then finalize mid-year 2018. Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC Is that going to serve just Canada or will it also serve the Eastern U.S.? And I was curious as to what kind of operation you are placing there. Is that going to be a good margin efficiency improvement like we saw in Renton this year? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Well, I was just in that, our current Toronto Distribution Center about two weeks ago, and the team does a great job in a 55,000-square-foot facility. This will triple the amount of space. We have a growing business, both our dealers and our customers in that area, and this will allow them to grow their parts business in that area and better support a growing base of customers. So, just you saw us build the Renton PDC this last year, which doubled the amount of square footage. We expanded our PDC in Lancaster in Pennsylvania, that really supports the Northeastern part of the U.S. We have a Distribution Center in Montréal that supports customers in Québec. So, this particular PDC is primarily focused on the Ontario area and Middle Canada. Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC Perfect. Thank you very much. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Neil Frohnapple of Longbow Research. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning, Neil. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC Thanks. Yeah. I believe a few years ago, you indicated that Kenworth and Peterbilt U.S. and Canada Class 8 vocational truck share was above 40%. Is that still the case today? And I guess as a follow-up, could you just talk about order activity for the segment in the market and the prospects from higher infrastructure spending potentially coming in 2018? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, I think that share position is still about right. In terms of demand in that arena, I think demand has been pretty consistent. And for sure, if there is substantial infrastructure investment, I think that would bode well for our ability to sell more trucks into that segment. So, the Peterbilt and Kenworth products do great in that area. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC Okay. Could you also talk about your industry outlook for the U.S. and Canada in medium-duty market versus 2016, whether you expect that to be flat, up or down? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I think fairly flat. Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC Great. Thanks a lot. Congrats, Bob. Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Robert Wertheimer of Barclays. Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Good morning. Could you talk about, you mentioned Russia earlier, where are we versus peak in Russia and what's the outlook for the next two, three years, I mean, gradual strengthening your return? And maybe just a second comment, we have data on used truck pricing, which you alluded to in the North American market. What is European used truck pricing like, up or down or flat? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, I'd say European used truck pricing is relatively flat. In terms of the Russian market, we're probably still on the ascent in terms of a couple years ago, the market was stronger. DAF sold about 3,000 trucks into Russia. Last year, it was just under 1,000 trucks. And so, there is good upward trend, but certainly more upside potential. Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc. Great. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Sam Rathod of Macquarie. Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Hi. Good mooning. Sameer Rathod. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning. Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. There has been a lot of discussion by the current administration about reducing regulation, including environmental. Do you think this is a net positive or negative for intermediate truck demand? Because on one hand, you have newer standards historically helping driving replacement cycles, on the other hand, reduced regulation may spur business activity. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. We're preparing for the regulations as they exist currently. It's difficult to plan based on speculation, and so we're developing our products for the future, following the greenhouse gas regulations that are in place. So, if those change, we will reevaluate our plans and adapt accordingly. Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Okay. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC Hey. Thanks. Morning, guys. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Good morning. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC So can you share the – sorry, if I missed it, what you're expecting for Parts revenue growth this year and Financial Services margins? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. So Parts revenue growth, I indicated we expect 2017 to be 2% to 4% growth rate. Financial Services margins, I think were – probably see our spreads be relatively steady, and I think a big factor in the results would be the movement of used truck values, but our portfolio in our Finance business is performing excellently. Our team generated a share of 26% of all PACCAR products sold that they financed last year. And so the finance team continues to manage their business in a very prudent way, and generate a good contribution to PACCAR's results. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. And then, just secondly, can you just talk about the percent of your U.S. cost of goods sold that are imported into the U.S.? And then maybe just broadly, how you're thinking about any potential changes you might want to make if we get a border adjustment tax? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. That's – a lot of speculation on trade matters, and so we'll address those as they come at us. We source materials from all over the world, majority out of the U.S., I don't know what that percentage might be. But we're – we source just as all the automotive and commercial vehicle industry does. So whatever the effects might be for us would be similar for the industry. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC So you're saying that you don't want to give a number in terms of how much of your U.S. cost of goods are imported, but you're saying you wouldn't think it's any different than any other OEM? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. I don't think it's any different. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Thank you. Operator And your final question comes from the line of Joel Tiss of BMO. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Last and least, I'm used to that. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Hey. The best for last with Joel. That's how I look at it. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Yeah. Something like that. And then, so just there's been a lot of questions, so I'll make it quick. But the fourth quarter, the drop-off in the gross margin and the profitability is really just from end of year adjusting inventory, cleaning out, whatever, getting rid of some new unused product, and feeling some of the pricing pressure that's been evident in the market to set up for 201. Is that fair? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah. I think there is a bit of competitive pricing pressure, the pound-euro exchange rate had some effect. In our fourth quarter, we typically will do some projects in our factories, so we have some maintenance projects that we do over the shutdown period. And so just normal stuff, so nothing unusual. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And then there was a slide from your December presentation that you – it suggested at least that you're going to capture some parts sales from the more technologically advanced stuff, like adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning system. Can you give me a sense of how can you do that? Those are someone else's – those are mostly someone else's parts. And so, I just – I don't know, it's hard for me to understand that. But I'm not the brightest guy in the planet either. Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc. So, Joel, we sell a combination of our captive parts, as well as vendor supplied parts that we bring into our warehouse and have available for dealers. We manage that dealer inventory, and as parts for those systems are consumed at retail, then we will resupply the dealer from our warehouses. But we have access to all parts that are used on PACCAR products around the world. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. So, just maybe a little bit less markup just because there is more hands touching it or something like that? Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Yeah, I think that's fair. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. All right. I'm not getting back in queue. Thank you very much. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Joel, always good to talk to you. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States) All right, see you. Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc. Bye. Operator There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company? Ken Hastings - PACCAR, Inc. We would like to thank everyone for their participation, and thank you, operator. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes PACCAR's earnings call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp. Thanks, Arnab. We had a stellar Q4 and fiscal 2017 with records in all of our financial metrics; revenue, gross margin, operating margins and EPS. Growth was driven primarily by Datacenter tripling with a rapid adoption of AI worldwide. Quarterly revenue reached $2.17 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, and up 8% sequentially, and above our outlook of $2.1 billion. Fiscal 2017 revenue was just over $6.9 billion, up 38% and nearly $2 billion more than fiscal 2016. Growth for the quarter and fiscal year was broad based with record revenue in each of our four platforms, Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive. Our full year performance demonstrates the success of our GPU platform-based business model. From a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GPU revenue grew 57% to $1.85 billion from a year earlier. Tegra Processor revenue was up 64% to $257 million. Let's start with our Gaming platform. Q4 Gaming revenue was a record $1.35 billion, rising 66% year-on-year and up 8% from Q3. Gamers continued to upgrade to our new Pascal-based GPUs. Adding to our gaming lineup we launched GTX 1050 class GPUs for notebooks, bringing eSports and VR capabilities to mobile at great value. The GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti were featured in more than 30 new models launched at last month's Consumer Electronics Show. To enhance the gaming experience, we announced G-SYNC HDR, a technology that enables displays which are brighter and more vibrant than any other gaming monitor. Our partners have launched more than 60 G-SYNC-capable monitors and laptops, enabling smooth play without screen tear artifact. eSports too continues to attract new gamers. Major tournaments with multi-million dollar purses are drawing enormous audiences. This last quarter, Dota 2 held its first major tournament of the season in Boston. Tickets sold out in minutes. The prize pool reached $3 million, and millions of gamers watched online. Moving to Professional Visualization, Quadro revenue grew 11% from a year ago to a record $225 million, driven by demand for high-end, real-time rendering and mobile workstations. We recently launched a family of Pascal-based GPUs designed for mobile workstations which leading OEMs are embracing. Earlier this week, we introduced Quadro GP100, which creates a new supercomputing workstation. This new type of workstation enables engineers, designers and artists to take advantage of new technologies of photorealism, fluid simulation and deep learning. Next, Datacenter; revenue more than tripled from a year ago, and was up 23% sequentially to $296 million. Growth was driven by AI, cloud service providers deploying GPU instances, High Performance Computing, GRID graphics virtualization, and our DGX AI supercomputing appliance. AI is transforming industries worldwide. The first adopters were hyperscale companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google, which use deep learning to provide billions to customers with AI services that utilizes image recognition and voice processing. The next area of growth will occur as enterprise in such fields as health care, retail, transportation and finance embrace deep learning on GPUs. At November's SC 2016 Supercomputing Conference, Microsoft announced that its GPU-accelerated Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit is available both in Azure cloud and on premises with our DGX-1 AI supercomputer. In a series of related announcements at SG 2016, we described our plans to join the Cancer Moonshot project in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Department of Energy and several national labs, to help build predictive models and guide treatment under this project. We are collaborating on a new AI framework called, CANDLE, the Cancer Distributed Learning Environment. And to support this work, we unveiled our new own supercomputer, the NVIDIA DGX SATURNV, which joins together 124 DGX-1 systems. It's currently the world's 28th fastest supercomputer, and the number one system in energy efficiency. Our GRID, graphics, virtualization business doubled year-on-year, driven by strong growth in the education, automotive, and energy sectors. We are excited to be hosting our eighth annual GPU Technology Conference here in Silicon Valley from May 8 to May 11. This will be the year's most important event for AI and accelerated computing. And we expect it to be our largest GTC yet, attended by thousands of application developers, scientists and academics, as well as entrepreneurs and corporate executives. Finally, in Automotive, revenue grew to a record $128 million, up 38% year-over-year. At Jen-Hsun's CES opening keynote, we demonstrated our leadership position in self-driving vehicles. With a growing list of industry players adopting our AI car platform, we also showcased AI co-pilot, a technology that will recognize a driver and their preferences, monitor their alertness, understand natural spoken language, and provide alerts in dangerous situations. One of the highlights at CES was the demonstration of our own autonomous car, dubbed BB8. More than 500 passengers took rides in the back seat without a driver behind the wheel. We announced a number of new partnerships at the show. Among them were collaborations with Bosch, the world's largest automotive supplier and ZF, Europe's leading supplier for the truck industry, both centered on developing AI car computers with DRIVE PX 2 technology. We also announced that we're working on cloud-to-car mapping collaboration with HERE, focused on the U.S. and Europe, and ZENRIN, focused on Japan. These complement partnerships announced in Q3 with Europe's TomTom and China's Baidu. Our mapping partnerships spanned all geographies. Jen-Hsun was joined on the CES stage by Audi of America's President, Scott Keogh. They announced the extension of our decade-long partnership to deliver cars with Level 4 autonomy starting in 2020, powered by DRIVE PX technology. Audi will deliver Level 3 autonomy in its A8 luxury sedan later this year through its zFAS system powered by NVIDIA. We also shared news at CES of our partnership with Mercedes-Benz to collaborate on a car that will be available by year's end. During the quarter, Tesla began delivering a new autopilot system powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 platform in every new Model S and Model X, to be followed by the Model 3. Tesla's cars will be capable of fully autonomous operation via future software updates. In addition, Volvo started turning over the keys to initial customers of its Drive Me program. Its XC90 SUVs equipped with DRIVE PX 2 are capable of fully autonomous operation on designated roads in Volvo's hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden. With NVIDIAs powering the market's only self-driving cars and partnerships with leading automakers, Tier 1 suppliers, and mapping companies, we feel very confident in our position as the transportation industry moves to autonomous vehicles. Next, our OEM and IP business was $176 million, down 11% year-on-year. Now, turning to the rest of the income statement for Q4. Gross margins were at record levels with GAAP gross margins at 60%, and non-GAAP at 60.2%. These reflect the success of our platform approach, as well as strong demand for GeForce gaming GPUs and deep learning. GAAP operating expenses were $570 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $498 million, up 12% from a year earlier, reflecting head count-related costs for our AI growth initiatives, as well as investments in sales and marketing. We are investing into huge market opportunities, AI, self-driving cars, cloud computing and gaming. Thus, we expect our operating expense growth rate to be in the high teens over the next several quarters. GAAP operating income was $733 million, and non-GAAP operating income was $809 million, both more than doubled from a year earlier. Our GAAP tax rate was 10%, and our non-GAAP was 13%. These rates were lower than expected, primarily due to a decrease in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax. GAAP EPS was $0.99. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.13. In fiscal year 2017, we returned $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, in line with our intention. For fiscal year 2018, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now, turning to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect revenue to be $1.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. At the mid-point, this represents 46% growth over the prior year. We expect Datacenter to grow sequentially. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 59.5% and 59.7%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. This guidance assumes that our licensing agreement with Intel ends at March and does not renew. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $603 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $520 million. GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $20 million, including additional charges from the early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $4 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 are both expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. With that, I'm going to turn it back for the operator so we can open up for questions. Please limit your questions to just one. Operator, let's start with the questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J., your line is open. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Can you hear me? Yeah, my apologies. Stuck on a plane here. Great, great, great results. I guess, was hoping to get a little more color on the Datacenter side. Now, that we've completed a full fiscal year 2017, would love to get some clarity on the different moving parts and contributions there. And then I guess, looking into 2018 how you see the growth unfolding thereafter? Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yeah, C.J. first of all, thanks a lot. Well, the single biggest mover would have to be Datacenter. I mean, when you look back on last year and we look forward, there's a lot of reasons why Datacenter business overall grew 3x, grew by a factor of three. And so I would expect that to happen, to continue. There's several elements of our Datacenter business. There's the high performance computing part. There's the AI part. There's GRID, which is graphics virtualization. There's cloud computing, which is providing our GPU platform up in the cloud for startups and enterprises and all kinds of external customers to be able to access in the cloud, as well as a brand new AI supercomputing appliance that we created last year for anybody who would like to engage deep learning and AI, but don't have the skills or don't have the resources or don't have the desire to build their own high performance computing cluster. And so we integrated all of that with all of the complicated software stacks into an appliance that we maintain over the cloud. We call that DGX-1. And so these pieces, AI, high performance computing, cloud computing, GRID and DGX all in contribution, contributed to our growth in Datacenter quite substantially. And so my sense is that, that as we look forward to next year, we're going to continue to see that major trend. Of course, gaming was a very large and important factor. And my expectation is that gaming is going to continue to do that. And then longer-term, longer-term our position in self-driving cars, I think, is becoming more and more clear to people over time. And I expect that self-driving cars will be available on the road starting this year with early movers, and no later than 2020 for Level 4 by the majors, and you might even see some of them pull into 2019. And so those are some of the things that we're looking forward to. Operator Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks. I actually had one question for Jen-Hsun, and one sort of clarification for Colette. So Jen-Hsun, where are we in the gaming cycle? It's been very strong the last few years. What proportion of your base do you think has upgraded to Pascal, and where does that usually peak before you launch your next-generation products? And then for Colette, just inventory dollars in days picked up. If you could give us some comment on that. And then just on OpEx productivity, you did a very good job last year, but this time you're saying OpEx will go up mid-teen. Do you still think there is operating leverage in the model? Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Well, let's say we typically assume that we have an installed base of a couple of 100 million GeForce gamers, and we've upgraded about two quarters of them, as in two operating quarters out of four years. It takes about three to four years to upgrade the entire installed base. And we started ramping Pascal, as you know, a few quarters ago. And our data would suggest that the upgrade cycle is going well, and we have plenty to go. Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp. Thanks, Vivek. On your question on inventory, as you know, in many of our businesses, we are still carrying a significant architecture, and a broad list of different products for those architectures across. We feel comfortable with our level of inventory as we look forward into fiscal year 2018 and our sales going forward. Your second question was regarding OpEx and comparing it to where we finished in 2017 and moving into fiscal year 2018. We do have some great opportunities, large businesses, for us to go capture the overall TAMs for, and we are going to be continuing to invest in the Datacenter, specifically in AI, self-driving cars, as well as gaming. And so rather than a focus on what the specific operating margin is, we're going to focus primarily just on growing the overall TAM, and capturing that TAM on the top line. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC Thanks for taking my question. Question back on the Datacenter, the growth was impressive. And I'm wondering, you mentioned that the hyperscale players really have embraced the products first, and I'm wondering if you could share with us to the extent that you think that they're embracing it for their own use, or to the extent that they're deploying it for services such as machine learning as a service and enterprises, are really kind of tapping into this also through the hyperscale guys. And I'm wondering, if you could help, you mentioned that the enterprise is where you expect to see embracing the technology next and healthcare, retail, transport, finance, and I'm wondering if you could share with us how you feel about that visibility, where you're getting that visibility from. Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Well, on hyperscale, you're absolutely right, that there's internal, what we call, internal use for deep learning, and then there's the hosting GPU in the cloud for external high-performance computing use, which includes deep learning. Inside the hyperscalers, the early adopters are moving obviously very, very fast. But everybody has to follow. Everybody has to follow. Deep learning has proven to be too effective, and you guys, everybody knows now that every hyperscaler in the world is investing very heavily in deep learning. And so my expectation is that, over the next coming years, deep learning and AI will become the essential tool by which they do their computing. Now, when they host it in the cloud, people out in the cloud use it for a variety of applications, and one of the reasons why the NVIDIA GPU is such a great platform is because of its broad utility. We've been working on GPU computing now for coming up on 12 years, and industry-after-industry, our GPU computing architecture has been embraced for high-performance computing, for data processing, for deep learning and such. And so when somebody hosts it up in the cloud, for example, Amazon putting our GPUs up in the cloud, that instance has the ability to do molecular dynamics, to deep learning training, to deep learning inferencing. Companies could use it for offloading their computation to start-ups being able to build their company and build their application, and then host it for hundreds of millions of people to use. And so I think the hyperscalers are going to continue to adopt GPU both for internal consumption, and cloud hosting for some time to come. And we're just in the beginning of that cycle, and that's one of the reasons why we have quite a fair amount of enthusiasm around the growth here. You mentioned Enterprise, and enterprise, it has all woken to the power of AI, and everybody understands that they have a treasure trove of data that they would like to find a way to discover insight from. In the case of real applications that we're engaging now, you could just imagine that in the transportation industry, car companies creating self-driving cars, one car company after another needs to take all of their row data and start to train their neural networks for their future self-driving cars. And so they use our DGX or Tesla GPUs to train the networks, which is then used to run their cars running on DRIVE PX. So that's one application example. Another application example, which is quite significant, is going to be the future of processing all of the HD maps in the world. You guys might have seen that, we announced that GTC, this API SDK called MapWorks. MapWorks takes video information, video information that is recorded from a car, and reconstructs the three-dimensional terrain information from that live video. And so it has to do computer vision, 3D reconstruction. It has to determine and detect where the lanes are, the signs are, the lights are, and even some interesting 3D features, maybe buildings and curbs and such. And it will do that automatically. And we need to process that for the world, for the planet. And you can just imagine how much video is being recorded today, and how much data is being generated, and how much inferencing, computer vision and 3D reconstruction that has to be done, and our GPUs are really quite perfect for it. And so MapWorks runs on top of our GPUs, and we're working with just about every mapping company in the world today to adopt MapWorks, and to do HD processing for their maps. So that's another example. Medical imaging companies all over the world have recognized the importance of deep learning, and their ability to detect cancer and retinopathy, and the list of examples goes on and on. And so all the different modalities have now recognized the importance of deep learning, and you're going to start to see one medical imaging company after another. The list of examples just keep on going. I mean, the fact of the matter is, at this point deep learning and AI has really become how future software development is going to be done for a large number of industries. And that's the enthusiasm that we're seeing around the world. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations to the team on great results and guide. My first question is for Jen-Hsun. Jen-Hsun, on the adoption of VR for gaming, if I look at the price points of the headset and the PC, a little bit high for a wider adoption. Could the use of GPU in the cloud, like you guys are introducing the GeForce NOW, be a way for the price points on VR to come down? And then I have a follow up for Colette. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. The first year of VR has sold several hundred thousand units, and many hundreds of thousands of units. And our VR works, SDK, which allows us to process graphics in very low latency, dealing with all of the computer vision processing, whether it's lens warping and such, it has delivered really excellent results. The early VR is really targeted at early adopters. And I think the focus of ensuring an excellent experience that surprises people, that delight people, by Oculus and by Valve and by Epic and by Vive, by ourselves, by the industry, has really been a good focus. And I think that we've delivered on the promise of a great experience. The thing that we have to do now is that we have to make the headsets easier-to-use, with fewer cables. We have to make it lighter, we have to make it cheaper. And so those are all things that the industry is working on, and as the applications continue to come online, you're going to see that they're going to meet themselves and find success. I think the experience is very, very clear that VR is exciting. However, remember that we are also in the VR – we also brought VR to computer-aided design and to professional applications. In this particular area, the cost is just simply not an issue. And in fact, many of the applications previously were power walls or caves, VR caves that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. And now you could put that same experience, if not even better, on the desk of designers and creators. And so I think that you're going to find that creative use and professional use of VR is going to grow quite rapidly. And just recently, we announced a brand new Quadro 5000, P5000 with VR, the world's first VR notebook that went to market with HP and Dell. And they're doing terrifically. And so I would think about VR in the context of both professional applications as well as consumer applications, but I think the first year was absolutely a great success. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit Shah - Instinet, LLC Yes. Thank you, and first of all, congratulations on a strong fiscal 2017. If I may, Jen-Hsun, the revenue beat this quarter wasn't as big as we've seen the last several periods, and most of it came from Datacenter. I totally understand that when the Gaming business expands as much as it has, it becomes harder to beat expectations by the same margin. But I was wondering if you could just spend some time talking about gaming demand, and how you think it was during the holiday season. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Well, the global PC gaming market is still vibrant and growing. And the number of eSports gamers around the world is growing. You guys know that Overwatch is a home run. Activision Blizzard's Overwatch is raging all over Asia and eSports fans all over the world are picking it up, and it's graphically very intensive. Without a 1050 class and above, it's simply a non-starter and to really enjoy it, you need at least a 1060. And so this last quarter we launched a 1050 and a 1050 Ti all over the world, and we're seeing terrific success out of that. And my expectation going into next year is that Overwatch is going to continue to spread all over the world. It's really basically just started. It started in the West and it's now moving into the East where the largest eSports markets are. And so Overwatch is going to be a huge success. League of Legends is going to continue to be a huge success. And my expectation is that the eSports along with AAA titles that are coming out this year is going to keep PC gaming continue to grow. And so I quite frankly thought Q4 was pretty terrific, and we had a record quarter. We had a record year, and I don't remember the last time that a large business the size of ours, and surely the size of a Datacenter business, grew by a factor of three. And so I think we're in a great position going into next year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Company. Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC Yeah, thanks. Jen-Hsun, can you talk a little bit about the evolution of artificial intelligence, and kind of make a distinction between artificial intelligence versus machine learning versus deep learning? They're different kind of categorizations and implementations of those different sub-segments. So I wanted to get a sense from you how NVIDIA's end-to-end computing platform kind of dominates machine learning relative to, say, the competition. Then I have a question on the gross margins, if I could. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yes. First of all thanks, thanks for the question. The way to think about that is deep learning is a breakthrough technique in the category of machine learning, and machine learning is an essential tool to enable AI, to achieve AI. If a computer can't learn, and if it can't learn continuously and adapt with the environment, there's no way to ever achieve artificial intelligence. Learning, as you know, is a foundational part of intelligence, and deep learning is a breakthrough technique where the software can write software by itself by learning from a large quantity of data. Prior to deep learning, other techniques like expert systems and rule-based systems and hand-engineered features, where engineers would write algorithms to figure out how to detect a cat, and then they would figure out how to write another algorithm to detect a car. You could imagine how difficult that is and how imperfect that is. It basically kind of works, but it doesn't work good enough, well enough to be useful. And then deep learning came along. The reason why deep learning took a long time to come along is because its singular handicap is that it requires an enormous amount of data to train the network, and it requires an enormous amount of computation. And that's why a lot of people credit the work that we've done with our programmable GPUs and our GPU computing platform and the early collaboration with deep learning. AI researchers as the big bang, if you will, the catalyst that made modern AI possible. We made it possible to crunch through an enormous amount of data to train these very deep neural networks. Now, the reason why deep learning has just swept the world, it started with a convolution of neural networks, but reinforcement networks and time sequence networks and all kinds of interesting adversarial networks. And the list of types of networks, I mean, there are 100 networks being created a week, and papers are coming out of everywhere. The reason why is because deep learning has proven to be quite robust. It is incredibly useful, and this tool has at the moment found no boundaries of problems that it's figured out how to solve. And I think that the traditional methods of machine learning are still going to be useful if the absolute precision of the prediction or classification is not necessarily super important. For example, if you wanted to understand the sentiment of consumers on a particular new product that you sent, whether the sentiment is exactly right, so long as you understand the basic trend, and you largely understand the sentiment, I think people would consider that information to be useful. However, if you're using machine learning for cancer detection, obviously we need to have a little precision that is quite high. And so whether it's in health care or financial services or high-performance computing and in some areas where, for example, ad supported Internet search, small differences in accuracy could make a very large difference in the financial results for the advertiser and for the people hosting the service. And so in all these cases, deep learning has found a great utility, and that's one of the reasons why we're seeing so much growth. And obviously for self-driving cars, being kind of right is not a good idea, and we like to be exactly right. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord. Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Thank you very much. Jen-Hsun, you guys obviously have won some business with your automotive supercomputer at Tesla in recent periods. And I was curious if you could comment on some of the application porting, and moving features from the previous architecture onto your architecture? And I guess how that's gone, and what you guys have learned through that process, and how it might be applied to some of your future partnerships. Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Sure. First of all, you know that we are a full stack platform. The way we think about all of our platforms is from the application all the way back to the fundamental architecture in a semiconductor device. And so in the case of DRIVE PX, we created the architecture, optimized for neural net, for sensor fusion, for high-speed processing. The semiconductor design, in the case of DRIVE PX 2 called Tegra Parker, the system software for high-speed sensor fusion and moving data all the way around the car, the better you do that, the lower cost the system will be. The neural networks on top of that, that sits on top of our deep learning SDK, called cuDNN and TensorRT, basically frameworks of AI, and then on top of that, the actual algorithms for figuring out how to use that information from perception to localization to action planning. And then on top of that, we have an API and an SDK that is integrated into map makers, and we integrate into every single map, HD map service in the world, from HERE to TomTom to ZENRIN in Japan, to Baidu in China. So this entire stack is a ton of software. But your question specifically has to do with the perception layer. And that perception layer quite frankly is just a small part of the self-driving car problem. And the reason for that is because in the final analysis, you want to detect lanes. You've got video coming in, you want to detect lanes, you have video coming in, you want to detect the car in front of you. And all we have to do, it's not trivial, but it's also not monumental, we have to detect and sense the lanes and the cars and we train our networks to do so. And as you know very well now, that deep neural net has the ability to detect objects far better than any human engineer computer vision algorithms prior to deep learning. And that's one of the reasons why Tesla and others have jumped on top of the deep learning approach and abandoned traditional hand featured computer vision approaches. And so anyways, the answer to your question is that by working on self-driving cars, and we realized that this is a much more than computer vision, that the self-driving car platform is a stack of software and algorithms that's quite complex, and now we've had a lot of experience doing so. And then recently at CES, we announced partnerships with Audi, which we announced that we will have Level 4 self-driving cars on the road by 2020. We announced a partnership with Daimler, we announced a partnership with ZF and Bosch, two of the world's top Tier 1 suppliers. We also announced partnerships with all of the mapping companies. And so if you put all that stuff together, we have the processor, we have the tier one partnerships for the integration of the systems, we have all the software on top of it, the deep learning networks, the car partnerships of course, and integrated into maps around the world. And all that entire stack when you put them all together should allow us to have self-driving cars on the road. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thank you for taking the question. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the inference market. Where are you in terms of hyperscale adoption for specialized inference type solutions, and how big you think that market can ultimately be? Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yes. The inference market is going to be very large. And as you know very well, in the future almost every computing device will have inferencing on it. A thermostat will have inferencing on it, a bicycle lock will have inferencing on it, cameras will have inferencing on it, and self-driving cars would have a large amount of inferencing on it. Robots, vacuum cleaners, you name it, smart microphones, smart speakers, all the way into the data center. And so I believe that long-term there will be a trillion devices that has inferencing connected to edge computing devices near them, connected to cloud computing devices, cloud computing servers. So that's basically the architecture. And so the largest inferencing platform will likely be arm devices. I think that that goes without saying. Arm will likely be running inferencing networks, 1-bit XNOR, 8-bit, and even some floating-point. It just depends on what level of accuracy do you want to achieve, what level of perception do you want to achieve, and how fast do you want to perceive it? And so the inferencing market is going to be quite large. We're going to focus in markets where the inferencing precision, the inferencing, the perception scenario and the performance by which you have to do is mission-critical. And of course, self-driving cars is a perfect example of that. Robots, manufacturing robots, will be another example of that. In the future you're going to see in our GTC, if you have a chance to see that, we're working with AI City partners all over the world for end-to-end video analytics, and that requires very high throughput, a lot of computation. And so the examples go on and on, all the way back into the data center. In the data center, there are several areas where inferencing is quite vital. I mentioned one number earlier, just mapping the earth, mapping the earth at the street level, mapping the earth in HD, in three-dimensional level for self-driving cars. Now, that process is going to require, well, just a pile of GPUs running continuously as we continuously update the information that needs to be mapped. There's inferencing, which is called offline inferencing where you have to retrain a network after you deployed it, and you would likely retrain and re-categorize, reclassify the data using the same servers that you used for training. And so even the training servers will be used for inferencing. And then lastly, all of the nodes in cloud will be inferencing nodes in the future. I've said before that I believe that every single node in the cloud data center will have inferencing capability and accelerated inferencing capability in the future. I continue to believe that and these are all opportunities for us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Charles Long from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hello. Can you hear me? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Sure. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi. This is Toshiya from Goldman. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the results. I had a question on gross margins. I think you're guiding Q1 gross margins only mildly below levels you saw in fiscal Q4, despite the royalty stream from Intel rolling over. And I'm guessing improvement of mix in Datacenter and parts of Gaming are driving this. But A, is that kind of the right way to think about the puts and takes going into Q1? And B, if that is indeed the case, should we expect gross margins to edge higher in future quarters and future years as data center becomes a bigger percentage of your business? Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp. Yeah, this is Colette. Let me see if I can help answer that. So you're correct in terms of how to look at that in Q1. The delta from Q4 to Q1 is, we only have a partial part of recognition from the Intel, and that stops in the middle of March. So as we move forward as well, going into Q2, we will also have the absence of what we had in Q1 moving to Q2. I'm not here to give guidance on Q2 because we just give guidance out one quarter, but keep that in mind, there's a partial amount of Intel still left in Q1 and then it depletes in Q2. If you think about our overall model, our overall business model, it has moved to higher and value-added platforms, and that's what we're selling. So our goal is absolutely to continue to concentrate on providing those higher-value platforms, that gives us the opportunity for gross margin as we make those investments in terms of an OpEx. We'll see what that kind of mix looks like as we go into Q2, but just to leave you with a understanding of Intel is probably what we can do here. Okay? Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First one is on the Datacenter tightening, just given the expected sequential growth in that business during the April quarter, can you talk about what products are helping to drive that? Is it possibly the DGX-1 computer box or is it more GPUs for training purposes at the hyperscale cloud datacenter? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. It would have to be Tesla processors using in the cloud. There are several SKUs of Tesla processors. There's the Tesla processors used for high-performance computing, and it has FP64, FP32, ECC, it's designed, and has CUDA of course, and it has been optimized for molecular dynamics, astrophysics, quantum chemistry, fluid dynamics, the list goes on and on. The vast majority of the world's high-performance supercomputing applications, imaging applications, 3D reconstruction application, it has been ported onto our GPUs over the course of the last decade and some, and that's a very large part of our Tesla business. Then of course, we introduced on top of the architecture our deep learning stack. Our deep learning stack starts with cuDNN, the numerics kernels, a lot of algorithms inside them to be optimized for numerical processing of all kinds of different precisions. It's integrated into frameworks of different kinds. There's so many different frameworks, from TensorRT to Caffe to Torch to Theano to MXnet to CNTK, the work that we did with Microsoft, which is really excellent, scaling it up from one GPU to many GPUs across multiple racks, and that's our deep learning stack, and that's also very important. And then the third is GRID. GRID is a completely different stack. It's the world's first graphics virtualization stack, fully integrated into Citrix, integrated into VMware. Every single workstation and PC application has been verified, tested and has the ability to be streamed from a datacenter. And then last year, I think we announced it in – we started shipping it in August, our DGX-1, the world's first AI supercomputer appliance, which integrates a whole bunch more software of all different types, and has the ability to – we introduced our first NVIDIA docker. It containerizes applications. It makes it possible for you to have a whole bunch of users use one DGX. They could all be running different frameworks because most environments are heterogeneous. And so that's DGX-1. And it's got an exciting pipeline ahead of it, and it's really designed for companies and workgroups who don't want to build their own supercomputer like the hyperscalers, and aren't quite ready to move into the cloud because they have too much data to move to the cloud. And so everybody basically can easily buy a DGX-1. It's fully integrated, fully supported, and get to work on deep learning right away. And so each one of these are all part of our Datacenter business. But the largest, because it's been around the longest since our Tesla business, but they're all growing, every single one of them. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James Financial, Inc. Great. Thanks a lot for the time. Just a quick question in the auto market. At CES, you had some solutions you were demonstrating. It showed in pretty significant decline in terms of the size and what was being offered. You really shrunk it down a lot, yet still having great performance. If you think out to sort of the Level 4 solution that you talked about for 2020, how small can you ultimately make that? It seems like you could be sort of relative to the size of the car pretty small. So just curious to hear your comment on that, and what impact having this system in the car makes on it. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. We currently have DRIVE PX. DRIVE PX today is a one-chip solution for Level 3. And with two chips, two processors, you can achieve Level 4. And with many processors, you could achieve Level 5 today. And some people are using many processors to develop their Level 5, and some people are using a couple of processors to develop their Level 4. Our next generation, so that's all based on the Pascal generation. That's all based on the Pascal generation. Our next generation, the processor is called Xavier. We announced that recently. Xavier basically takes four processors and shrink it into one. And so we'll be able to achieve Level 4 with one processor. That's the easiest way to think about it. So we'll achieve Level 3 with one processor today. Next year, we'll achieve Level 4 with one processor, and with several processors, you could achieve Level 5. But I think that the number of processors is really interesting because we need to do the processing of sensor fusion, and we got to do perception. We have to do localization. We have to do driving. There's a lot of functional safety aspects to it, failover functionality. There are all kinds of black box recorders, all kinds of different functionality that goes into the processor. And I think it's really quite interesting. But in the final analysis, what's really, really hard, and this is one of the reasons why our positioning in the autonomous driving market is becoming more and more clear, is that in the final analysis, there's really a software problem. And it's an end-to-end software problem. It goes all the way from processing, in the perception processing in the car to AI processing to helping you drive, connected to HD clouds for HD map processing all over the world. And so this end-to-end stack of software is really quite a large undertaking. I don't know where anybody else is currently doing that with the exception of one or two companies. And so I think that that's really where the great complexity is. We have the ability to see and optimize across the entire range. Now, the other thing that we announced at CES that's worth mentioning is that we believe in a future, Level 4 means that you will have autopilot capability, hands-free autopilot capability in many scenarios. However, it's unlikely to ensure and to guarantee that in every scenario that you can achieve Level 4. It's just not practical for some time. However, during those circumstances, we believe that the car should still have an AI, that the car should be monitoring what's happening outside and it should be monitoring the driver. And when it's not driving for you, it's looking out for you. And we call that the AI co-pilot. Whereas AI autopilot achieves Level 4 driving, AI co-pilot looks out for you in the event that it doesn't have the confidence to drive on your behalf. And so I believe that that's a really big breakthrough, and we're just seeing incredible excitement about it around the industry because I think it just makes a lot of sense. And the combination of the two systems allows us to achieve, build a better car. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley & Company. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Thanks for sneaking me in, and congratulations on the very good execution. Jen-Hsun, I wanted to come back to the Gaming platform. You've now got the business running at a $5 billion annualized run rate. So congratulations on the growth there. I think investors look at that as a business that's been built on the strength of a vibrant enthusiast market. But at CES, you announced the GeForce NOW offering, which really allows you to tap into the more casual potential gamer. So the question is, what will GeForce NOW do incrementally for the opportunity that you have with your Gaming platform? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yeah, I appreciate that. I think, first of all, the PC gaming market is growing because of a dynamic that nobody ever expected, a dynamic that nobody ever expected 20 years ago. And that's basically how video games went from being a game to becoming a sport. And not only is it a sport, it's a social sport. And in order to play some of these modern eSports games, it's a five-on-five. and so you kind of need four other friends. And so as a result, in order to enjoy, to be part of this phenomenon that's sweeping the world, that it's rather sticky. And that's one of the reasons why Activision Blizzard is doing so well, that's one of the reasons why Tencent is doing so well. These two companies have benefited tremendously from the eSport dynamic, and we're seeing it all over the world. And although it's free to play for some people, of course, you need to have a reasonably good computer to run it. And that's one of the reasons why you need GeForce in your PC so that you can enjoy these sports. When it's also a sport, nobody likes to lose, and surely nobody likes to blame their equipment when they do lose. And so having GeForce, it gives you confidence and it gives you an edge, and for a lot of gamers it's just the gold standard. And so I think that number one, eSports is one the reasons why gaming continues to grow. And I think at this point it's fair to say that even though it's now the second most-watched spectator sport on the planet behind Super Bowl, it is also the second highest paid winning sport behind football. It will soon be the largest sport in the world, and I can't imagine too many young people long term not coming into this sport somehow and as this sport continues to expand in genres. And so that's one of the core reasons. Now, you asked a question about GeForce NOW, which I really appreciate. Now, the simple way to think about that is that there are many computers in the world that simply don't have the ability to enjoy video games, whether it's extremely thin and light notebooks, Apple Macs, Chromebooks, the integrated graphics that don't have very good capabilities, I think that the reasonable thing to do is to put the technology in the cloud, and it took us some five years to make this possible, to put the technology in the cloud and stream the video game experience with very low latency to the computer like Netflix does. And so we're basically turning the PC into a virtualized gaming experience and putting that into cloud. So I don't know exactly how big it's going to be yet, but our aspiration is that, that we would reach the parts of the markets where they're casual, or they just want to have another way, another device where they can game or somebody would like to come into the gaming world, and isn't quite ready to invest the time in building a computer or buying into a GeForce PC yet. So I'm anxious to learn from it, and when I learn more about GeForce, then I'll be more than happy to share it. Operator Unfortunately, that is all the time we have for questions. Do you have any closing remarks? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. I want to thank all of you guys for following us. We had a record year, a record quarter. And most importantly, we're at the beginning of the AI computing revolution. This is a new form of computing, new way of computing, where parallel data processing is vital to success, and GPU computing that we've been nurturing for the last decade and some is really the perfect computing approach. We're seeing tremendous growth and exciting growth in the data center market. Datacenter now represents, had grew 3x over year-over-year, and it's on its way to become a very significant business for us. Gaming is a significant business for us, and longer term, self-driving cars is going to be a really exciting growth opportunity. The thing that has really changed our company, what really defines how our company goes to market today, is really the platform approach, that instead of just building a chip that is industry standard, we created software stacks on top of it to serve vertical markets that we believe will be exciting long term that we can serve. And we find ourselves incredibly well positioned now in gaming, in AI and in self-driving cars. I want to thank all of you guys for following NVIDIA, and have a great year.

Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J., your line is open. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Can you hear me? Yeah, my apologies. Stuck on a plane here. Great, great, great results. I guess, was hoping to get a little more color on the Datacenter side. Now, that we've completed a full fiscal year 2017, would love to get some clarity on the different moving parts and contributions there. And then I guess, looking into 2018 how you see the growth unfolding thereafter? Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yeah, C.J. first of all, thanks a lot. Well, the single biggest mover would have to be Datacenter. I mean, when you look back on last year and we look forward, there's a lot of reasons why Datacenter business overall grew 3x, grew by a factor of three. And so I would expect that to happen, to continue. There's several elements of our Datacenter business. There's the high performance computing part. There's the AI part. There's GRID, which is graphics virtualization. There's cloud computing, which is providing our GPU platform up in the cloud for startups and enterprises and all kinds of external customers to be able to access in the cloud, as well as a brand new AI supercomputing appliance that we created last year for anybody who would like to engage deep learning and AI, but don't have the skills or don't have the resources or don't have the desire to build their own high performance computing cluster. And so we integrated all of that with all of the complicated software stacks into an appliance that we maintain over the cloud. We call that DGX-1. And so these pieces, AI, high performance computing, cloud computing, GRID and DGX all in contribution, contributed to our growth in Datacenter quite substantially. And so my sense is that, that as we look forward to next year, we're going to continue to see that major trend. Of course, gaming was a very large and important factor. And my expectation is that gaming is going to continue to do that. And then longer-term, longer-term our position in self-driving cars, I think, is becoming more and more clear to people over time. And I expect that self-driving cars will be available on the road starting this year with early movers, and no later than 2020 for Level 4 by the majors, and you might even see some of them pull into 2019. And so those are some of the things that we're looking forward to. Operator Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks. I actually had one question for Jen-Hsun, and one sort of clarification for Colette. So Jen-Hsun, where are we in the gaming cycle? It's been very strong the last few years. What proportion of your base do you think has upgraded to Pascal, and where does that usually peak before you launch your next-generation products? And then for Colette, just inventory dollars in days picked up. If you could give us some comment on that. And then just on OpEx productivity, you did a very good job last year, but this time you're saying OpEx will go up mid-teen. Do you still think there is operating leverage in the model? Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Well, let's say we typically assume that we have an installed base of a couple of 100 million GeForce gamers, and we've upgraded about two quarters of them, as in two operating quarters out of four years. It takes about three to four years to upgrade the entire installed base. And we started ramping Pascal, as you know, a few quarters ago. And our data would suggest that the upgrade cycle is going well, and we have plenty to go. Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp. Thanks, Vivek. On your question on inventory, as you know, in many of our businesses, we are still carrying a significant architecture, and a broad list of different products for those architectures across. We feel comfortable with our level of inventory as we look forward into fiscal year 2018 and our sales going forward. Your second question was regarding OpEx and comparing it to where we finished in 2017 and moving into fiscal year 2018. We do have some great opportunities, large businesses, for us to go capture the overall TAMs for, and we are going to be continuing to invest in the Datacenter, specifically in AI, self-driving cars, as well as gaming. And so rather than a focus on what the specific operating margin is, we're going to focus primarily just on growing the overall TAM, and capturing that TAM on the top line. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC Thanks for taking my question. Question back on the Datacenter, the growth was impressive. And I'm wondering, you mentioned that the hyperscale players really have embraced the products first, and I'm wondering if you could share with us to the extent that you think that they're embracing it for their own use, or to the extent that they're deploying it for services such as machine learning as a service and enterprises, are really kind of tapping into this also through the hyperscale guys. And I'm wondering, if you could help, you mentioned that the enterprise is where you expect to see embracing the technology next and healthcare, retail, transport, finance, and I'm wondering if you could share with us how you feel about that visibility, where you're getting that visibility from. Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Well, on hyperscale, you're absolutely right, that there's internal, what we call, internal use for deep learning, and then there's the hosting GPU in the cloud for external high-performance computing use, which includes deep learning. Inside the hyperscalers, the early adopters are moving obviously very, very fast. But everybody has to follow. Everybody has to follow. Deep learning has proven to be too effective, and you guys, everybody knows now that every hyperscaler in the world is investing very heavily in deep learning. And so my expectation is that, over the next coming years, deep learning and AI will become the essential tool by which they do their computing. Now, when they host it in the cloud, people out in the cloud use it for a variety of applications, and one of the reasons why the NVIDIA GPU is such a great platform is because of its broad utility. We've been working on GPU computing now for coming up on 12 years, and industry-after-industry, our GPU computing architecture has been embraced for high-performance computing, for data processing, for deep learning and such. And so when somebody hosts it up in the cloud, for example, Amazon putting our GPUs up in the cloud, that instance has the ability to do molecular dynamics, to deep learning training, to deep learning inferencing. Companies could use it for offloading their computation to start-ups being able to build their company and build their application, and then host it for hundreds of millions of people to use. And so I think the hyperscalers are going to continue to adopt GPU both for internal consumption, and cloud hosting for some time to come. And we're just in the beginning of that cycle, and that's one of the reasons why we have quite a fair amount of enthusiasm around the growth here. You mentioned Enterprise, and enterprise, it has all woken to the power of AI, and everybody understands that they have a treasure trove of data that they would like to find a way to discover insight from. In the case of real applications that we're engaging now, you could just imagine that in the transportation industry, car companies creating self-driving cars, one car company after another needs to take all of their row data and start to train their neural networks for their future self-driving cars. And so they use our DGX or Tesla GPUs to train the networks, which is then used to run their cars running on DRIVE PX. So that's one application example. Another application example, which is quite significant, is going to be the future of processing all of the HD maps in the world. You guys might have seen that, we announced that GTC, this API SDK called MapWorks. MapWorks takes video information, video information that is recorded from a car, and reconstructs the three-dimensional terrain information from that live video. And so it has to do computer vision, 3D reconstruction. It has to determine and detect where the lanes are, the signs are, the lights are, and even some interesting 3D features, maybe buildings and curbs and such. And it will do that automatically. And we need to process that for the world, for the planet. And you can just imagine how much video is being recorded today, and how much data is being generated, and how much inferencing, computer vision and 3D reconstruction that has to be done, and our GPUs are really quite perfect for it. And so MapWorks runs on top of our GPUs, and we're working with just about every mapping company in the world today to adopt MapWorks, and to do HD processing for their maps. So that's another example. Medical imaging companies all over the world have recognized the importance of deep learning, and their ability to detect cancer and retinopathy, and the list of examples goes on and on. And so all the different modalities have now recognized the importance of deep learning, and you're going to start to see one medical imaging company after another. The list of examples just keep on going. I mean, the fact of the matter is, at this point deep learning and AI has really become how future software development is going to be done for a large number of industries. And that's the enthusiasm that we're seeing around the world. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations to the team on great results and guide. My first question is for Jen-Hsun. Jen-Hsun, on the adoption of VR for gaming, if I look at the price points of the headset and the PC, a little bit high for a wider adoption. Could the use of GPU in the cloud, like you guys are introducing the GeForce NOW, be a way for the price points on VR to come down? And then I have a follow up for Colette. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. The first year of VR has sold several hundred thousand units, and many hundreds of thousands of units. And our VR works, SDK, which allows us to process graphics in very low latency, dealing with all of the computer vision processing, whether it's lens warping and such, it has delivered really excellent results. The early VR is really targeted at early adopters. And I think the focus of ensuring an excellent experience that surprises people, that delight people, by Oculus and by Valve and by Epic and by Vive, by ourselves, by the industry, has really been a good focus. And I think that we've delivered on the promise of a great experience. The thing that we have to do now is that we have to make the headsets easier-to-use, with fewer cables. We have to make it lighter, we have to make it cheaper. And so those are all things that the industry is working on, and as the applications continue to come online, you're going to see that they're going to meet themselves and find success. I think the experience is very, very clear that VR is exciting. However, remember that we are also in the VR – we also brought VR to computer-aided design and to professional applications. In this particular area, the cost is just simply not an issue. And in fact, many of the applications previously were power walls or caves, VR caves that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. And now you could put that same experience, if not even better, on the desk of designers and creators. And so I think that you're going to find that creative use and professional use of VR is going to grow quite rapidly. And just recently, we announced a brand new Quadro 5000, P5000 with VR, the world's first VR notebook that went to market with HP and Dell. And they're doing terrifically. And so I would think about VR in the context of both professional applications as well as consumer applications, but I think the first year was absolutely a great success. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit Shah - Instinet, LLC Yes. Thank you, and first of all, congratulations on a strong fiscal 2017. If I may, Jen-Hsun, the revenue beat this quarter wasn't as big as we've seen the last several periods, and most of it came from Datacenter. I totally understand that when the Gaming business expands as much as it has, it becomes harder to beat expectations by the same margin. But I was wondering if you could just spend some time talking about gaming demand, and how you think it was during the holiday season. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Well, the global PC gaming market is still vibrant and growing. And the number of eSports gamers around the world is growing. You guys know that Overwatch is a home run. Activision Blizzard's Overwatch is raging all over Asia and eSports fans all over the world are picking it up, and it's graphically very intensive. Without a 1050 class and above, it's simply a non-starter and to really enjoy it, you need at least a 1060. And so this last quarter we launched a 1050 and a 1050 Ti all over the world, and we're seeing terrific success out of that. And my expectation going into next year is that Overwatch is going to continue to spread all over the world. It's really basically just started. It started in the West and it's now moving into the East where the largest eSports markets are. And so Overwatch is going to be a huge success. League of Legends is going to continue to be a huge success. And my expectation is that the eSports along with AAA titles that are coming out this year is going to keep PC gaming continue to grow. And so I quite frankly thought Q4 was pretty terrific, and we had a record quarter. We had a record year, and I don't remember the last time that a large business the size of ours, and surely the size of a Datacenter business, grew by a factor of three. And so I think we're in a great position going into next year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Company. Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC Yeah, thanks. Jen-Hsun, can you talk a little bit about the evolution of artificial intelligence, and kind of make a distinction between artificial intelligence versus machine learning versus deep learning? They're different kind of categorizations and implementations of those different sub-segments. So I wanted to get a sense from you how NVIDIA's end-to-end computing platform kind of dominates machine learning relative to, say, the competition. Then I have a question on the gross margins, if I could. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yes. First of all thanks, thanks for the question. The way to think about that is deep learning is a breakthrough technique in the category of machine learning, and machine learning is an essential tool to enable AI, to achieve AI. If a computer can't learn, and if it can't learn continuously and adapt with the environment, there's no way to ever achieve artificial intelligence. Learning, as you know, is a foundational part of intelligence, and deep learning is a breakthrough technique where the software can write software by itself by learning from a large quantity of data. Prior to deep learning, other techniques like expert systems and rule-based systems and hand-engineered features, where engineers would write algorithms to figure out how to detect a cat, and then they would figure out how to write another algorithm to detect a car. You could imagine how difficult that is and how imperfect that is. It basically kind of works, but it doesn't work good enough, well enough to be useful. And then deep learning came along. The reason why deep learning took a long time to come along is because its singular handicap is that it requires an enormous amount of data to train the network, and it requires an enormous amount of computation. And that's why a lot of people credit the work that we've done with our programmable GPUs and our GPU computing platform and the early collaboration with deep learning. AI researchers as the big bang, if you will, the catalyst that made modern AI possible. We made it possible to crunch through an enormous amount of data to train these very deep neural networks. Now, the reason why deep learning has just swept the world, it started with a convolution of neural networks, but reinforcement networks and time sequence networks and all kinds of interesting adversarial networks. And the list of types of networks, I mean, there are 100 networks being created a week, and papers are coming out of everywhere. The reason why is because deep learning has proven to be quite robust. It is incredibly useful, and this tool has at the moment found no boundaries of problems that it's figured out how to solve. And I think that the traditional methods of machine learning are still going to be useful if the absolute precision of the prediction or classification is not necessarily super important. For example, if you wanted to understand the sentiment of consumers on a particular new product that you sent, whether the sentiment is exactly right, so long as you understand the basic trend, and you largely understand the sentiment, I think people would consider that information to be useful. However, if you're using machine learning for cancer detection, obviously we need to have a little precision that is quite high. And so whether it's in health care or financial services or high-performance computing and in some areas where, for example, ad supported Internet search, small differences in accuracy could make a very large difference in the financial results for the advertiser and for the people hosting the service. And so in all these cases, deep learning has found a great utility, and that's one of the reasons why we're seeing so much growth. And obviously for self-driving cars, being kind of right is not a good idea, and we like to be exactly right. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord. Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Thank you very much. Jen-Hsun, you guys obviously have won some business with your automotive supercomputer at Tesla in recent periods. And I was curious if you could comment on some of the application porting, and moving features from the previous architecture onto your architecture? And I guess how that's gone, and what you guys have learned through that process, and how it might be applied to some of your future partnerships. Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Sure. First of all, you know that we are a full stack platform. The way we think about all of our platforms is from the application all the way back to the fundamental architecture in a semiconductor device. And so in the case of DRIVE PX, we created the architecture, optimized for neural net, for sensor fusion, for high-speed processing. The semiconductor design, in the case of DRIVE PX 2 called Tegra Parker, the system software for high-speed sensor fusion and moving data all the way around the car, the better you do that, the lower cost the system will be. The neural networks on top of that, that sits on top of our deep learning SDK, called cuDNN and TensorRT, basically frameworks of AI, and then on top of that, the actual algorithms for figuring out how to use that information from perception to localization to action planning. And then on top of that, we have an API and an SDK that is integrated into map makers, and we integrate into every single map, HD map service in the world, from HERE to TomTom to ZENRIN in Japan, to Baidu in China. So this entire stack is a ton of software. But your question specifically has to do with the perception layer. And that perception layer quite frankly is just a small part of the self-driving car problem. And the reason for that is because in the final analysis, you want to detect lanes. You've got video coming in, you want to detect lanes, you have video coming in, you want to detect the car in front of you. And all we have to do, it's not trivial, but it's also not monumental, we have to detect and sense the lanes and the cars and we train our networks to do so. And as you know very well now, that deep neural net has the ability to detect objects far better than any human engineer computer vision algorithms prior to deep learning. And that's one of the reasons why Tesla and others have jumped on top of the deep learning approach and abandoned traditional hand featured computer vision approaches. And so anyways, the answer to your question is that by working on self-driving cars, and we realized that this is a much more than computer vision, that the self-driving car platform is a stack of software and algorithms that's quite complex, and now we've had a lot of experience doing so. And then recently at CES, we announced partnerships with Audi, which we announced that we will have Level 4 self-driving cars on the road by 2020. We announced a partnership with Daimler, we announced a partnership with ZF and Bosch, two of the world's top Tier 1 suppliers. We also announced partnerships with all of the mapping companies. And so if you put all that stuff together, we have the processor, we have the tier one partnerships for the integration of the systems, we have all the software on top of it, the deep learning networks, the car partnerships of course, and integrated into maps around the world. And all that entire stack when you put them all together should allow us to have self-driving cars on the road. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thank you for taking the question. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the inference market. Where are you in terms of hyperscale adoption for specialized inference type solutions, and how big you think that market can ultimately be? Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yes. The inference market is going to be very large. And as you know very well, in the future almost every computing device will have inferencing on it. A thermostat will have inferencing on it, a bicycle lock will have inferencing on it, cameras will have inferencing on it, and self-driving cars would have a large amount of inferencing on it. Robots, vacuum cleaners, you name it, smart microphones, smart speakers, all the way into the data center. And so I believe that long-term there will be a trillion devices that has inferencing connected to edge computing devices near them, connected to cloud computing devices, cloud computing servers. So that's basically the architecture. And so the largest inferencing platform will likely be arm devices. I think that that goes without saying. Arm will likely be running inferencing networks, 1-bit XNOR, 8-bit, and even some floating-point. It just depends on what level of accuracy do you want to achieve, what level of perception do you want to achieve, and how fast do you want to perceive it? And so the inferencing market is going to be quite large. We're going to focus in markets where the inferencing precision, the inferencing, the perception scenario and the performance by which you have to do is mission-critical. And of course, self-driving cars is a perfect example of that. Robots, manufacturing robots, will be another example of that. In the future you're going to see in our GTC, if you have a chance to see that, we're working with AI City partners all over the world for end-to-end video analytics, and that requires very high throughput, a lot of computation. And so the examples go on and on, all the way back into the data center. In the data center, there are several areas where inferencing is quite vital. I mentioned one number earlier, just mapping the earth, mapping the earth at the street level, mapping the earth in HD, in three-dimensional level for self-driving cars. Now, that process is going to require, well, just a pile of GPUs running continuously as we continuously update the information that needs to be mapped. There's inferencing, which is called offline inferencing where you have to retrain a network after you deployed it, and you would likely retrain and re-categorize, reclassify the data using the same servers that you used for training. And so even the training servers will be used for inferencing. And then lastly, all of the nodes in cloud will be inferencing nodes in the future. I've said before that I believe that every single node in the cloud data center will have inferencing capability and accelerated inferencing capability in the future. I continue to believe that and these are all opportunities for us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Charles Long from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hello. Can you hear me? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Sure. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi. This is Toshiya from Goldman. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the results. I had a question on gross margins. I think you're guiding Q1 gross margins only mildly below levels you saw in fiscal Q4, despite the royalty stream from Intel rolling over. And I'm guessing improvement of mix in Datacenter and parts of Gaming are driving this. But A, is that kind of the right way to think about the puts and takes going into Q1? And B, if that is indeed the case, should we expect gross margins to edge higher in future quarters and future years as data center becomes a bigger percentage of your business? Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp. Yeah, this is Colette. Let me see if I can help answer that. So you're correct in terms of how to look at that in Q1. The delta from Q4 to Q1 is, we only have a partial part of recognition from the Intel, and that stops in the middle of March. So as we move forward as well, going into Q2, we will also have the absence of what we had in Q1 moving to Q2. I'm not here to give guidance on Q2 because we just give guidance out one quarter, but keep that in mind, there's a partial amount of Intel still left in Q1 and then it depletes in Q2. If you think about our overall model, our overall business model, it has moved to higher and value-added platforms, and that's what we're selling. So our goal is absolutely to continue to concentrate on providing those higher-value platforms, that gives us the opportunity for gross margin as we make those investments in terms of an OpEx. We'll see what that kind of mix looks like as we go into Q2, but just to leave you with a understanding of Intel is probably what we can do here. Okay? Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First one is on the Datacenter tightening, just given the expected sequential growth in that business during the April quarter, can you talk about what products are helping to drive that? Is it possibly the DGX-1 computer box or is it more GPUs for training purposes at the hyperscale cloud datacenter? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. It would have to be Tesla processors using in the cloud. There are several SKUs of Tesla processors. There's the Tesla processors used for high-performance computing, and it has FP64, FP32, ECC, it's designed, and has CUDA of course, and it has been optimized for molecular dynamics, astrophysics, quantum chemistry, fluid dynamics, the list goes on and on. The vast majority of the world's high-performance supercomputing applications, imaging applications, 3D reconstruction application, it has been ported onto our GPUs over the course of the last decade and some, and that's a very large part of our Tesla business. Then of course, we introduced on top of the architecture our deep learning stack. Our deep learning stack starts with cuDNN, the numerics kernels, a lot of algorithms inside them to be optimized for numerical processing of all kinds of different precisions. It's integrated into frameworks of different kinds. There's so many different frameworks, from TensorRT to Caffe to Torch to Theano to MXnet to CNTK, the work that we did with Microsoft, which is really excellent, scaling it up from one GPU to many GPUs across multiple racks, and that's our deep learning stack, and that's also very important. And then the third is GRID. GRID is a completely different stack. It's the world's first graphics virtualization stack, fully integrated into Citrix, integrated into VMware. Every single workstation and PC application has been verified, tested and has the ability to be streamed from a datacenter. And then last year, I think we announced it in – we started shipping it in August, our DGX-1, the world's first AI supercomputer appliance, which integrates a whole bunch more software of all different types, and has the ability to – we introduced our first NVIDIA docker. It containerizes applications. It makes it possible for you to have a whole bunch of users use one DGX. They could all be running different frameworks because most environments are heterogeneous. And so that's DGX-1. And it's got an exciting pipeline ahead of it, and it's really designed for companies and workgroups who don't want to build their own supercomputer like the hyperscalers, and aren't quite ready to move into the cloud because they have too much data to move to the cloud. And so everybody basically can easily buy a DGX-1. It's fully integrated, fully supported, and get to work on deep learning right away. And so each one of these are all part of our Datacenter business. But the largest, because it's been around the longest since our Tesla business, but they're all growing, every single one of them. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James Financial, Inc. Great. Thanks a lot for the time. Just a quick question in the auto market. At CES, you had some solutions you were demonstrating. It showed in pretty significant decline in terms of the size and what was being offered. You really shrunk it down a lot, yet still having great performance. If you think out to sort of the Level 4 solution that you talked about for 2020, how small can you ultimately make that? It seems like you could be sort of relative to the size of the car pretty small. So just curious to hear your comment on that, and what impact having this system in the car makes on it. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. We currently have DRIVE PX. DRIVE PX today is a one-chip solution for Level 3. And with two chips, two processors, you can achieve Level 4. And with many processors, you could achieve Level 5 today. And some people are using many processors to develop their Level 5, and some people are using a couple of processors to develop their Level 4. Our next generation, so that's all based on the Pascal generation. That's all based on the Pascal generation. Our next generation, the processor is called Xavier. We announced that recently. Xavier basically takes four processors and shrink it into one. And so we'll be able to achieve Level 4 with one processor. That's the easiest way to think about it. So we'll achieve Level 3 with one processor today. Next year, we'll achieve Level 4 with one processor, and with several processors, you could achieve Level 5. But I think that the number of processors is really interesting because we need to do the processing of sensor fusion, and we got to do perception. We have to do localization. We have to do driving. There's a lot of functional safety aspects to it, failover functionality. There are all kinds of black box recorders, all kinds of different functionality that goes into the processor. And I think it's really quite interesting. But in the final analysis, what's really, really hard, and this is one of the reasons why our positioning in the autonomous driving market is becoming more and more clear, is that in the final analysis, there's really a software problem. And it's an end-to-end software problem. It goes all the way from processing, in the perception processing in the car to AI processing to helping you drive, connected to HD clouds for HD map processing all over the world. And so this end-to-end stack of software is really quite a large undertaking. I don't know where anybody else is currently doing that with the exception of one or two companies. And so I think that that's really where the great complexity is. We have the ability to see and optimize across the entire range. Now, the other thing that we announced at CES that's worth mentioning is that we believe in a future, Level 4 means that you will have autopilot capability, hands-free autopilot capability in many scenarios. However, it's unlikely to ensure and to guarantee that in every scenario that you can achieve Level 4. It's just not practical for some time. However, during those circumstances, we believe that the car should still have an AI, that the car should be monitoring what's happening outside and it should be monitoring the driver. And when it's not driving for you, it's looking out for you. And we call that the AI co-pilot. Whereas AI autopilot achieves Level 4 driving, AI co-pilot looks out for you in the event that it doesn't have the confidence to drive on your behalf. And so I believe that that's a really big breakthrough, and we're just seeing incredible excitement about it around the industry because I think it just makes a lot of sense. And the combination of the two systems allows us to achieve, build a better car. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley & Company. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Thanks for sneaking me in, and congratulations on the very good execution. Jen-Hsun, I wanted to come back to the Gaming platform. You've now got the business running at a $5 billion annualized run rate. So congratulations on the growth there. I think investors look at that as a business that's been built on the strength of a vibrant enthusiast market. But at CES, you announced the GeForce NOW offering, which really allows you to tap into the more casual potential gamer. So the question is, what will GeForce NOW do incrementally for the opportunity that you have with your Gaming platform? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yeah, I appreciate that. I think, first of all, the PC gaming market is growing because of a dynamic that nobody ever expected, a dynamic that nobody ever expected 20 years ago. And that's basically how video games went from being a game to becoming a sport. And not only is it a sport, it's a social sport. And in order to play some of these modern eSports games, it's a five-on-five. and so you kind of need four other friends. And so as a result, in order to enjoy, to be part of this phenomenon that's sweeping the world, that it's rather sticky. And that's one of the reasons why Activision Blizzard is doing so well, that's one of the reasons why Tencent is doing so well. These two companies have benefited tremendously from the eSport dynamic, and we're seeing it all over the world. And although it's free to play for some people, of course, you need to have a reasonably good computer to run it. And that's one of the reasons why you need GeForce in your PC so that you can enjoy these sports. When it's also a sport, nobody likes to lose, and surely nobody likes to blame their equipment when they do lose. And so having GeForce, it gives you confidence and it gives you an edge, and for a lot of gamers it's just the gold standard. And so I think that number one, eSports is one the reasons why gaming continues to grow. And I think at this point it's fair to say that even though it's now the second most-watched spectator sport on the planet behind Super Bowl, it is also the second highest paid winning sport behind football. It will soon be the largest sport in the world, and I can't imagine too many young people long term not coming into this sport somehow and as this sport continues to expand in genres. And so that's one of the core reasons. Now, you asked a question about GeForce NOW, which I really appreciate. Now, the simple way to think about that is that there are many computers in the world that simply don't have the ability to enjoy video games, whether it's extremely thin and light notebooks, Apple Macs, Chromebooks, the integrated graphics that don't have very good capabilities, I think that the reasonable thing to do is to put the technology in the cloud, and it took us some five years to make this possible, to put the technology in the cloud and stream the video game experience with very low latency to the computer like Netflix does. And so we're basically turning the PC into a virtualized gaming experience and putting that into cloud. So I don't know exactly how big it's going to be yet, but our aspiration is that, that we would reach the parts of the markets where they're casual, or they just want to have another way, another device where they can game or somebody would like to come into the gaming world, and isn't quite ready to invest the time in building a computer or buying into a GeForce PC yet. So I'm anxious to learn from it, and when I learn more about GeForce, then I'll be more than happy to share it. Operator Unfortunately, that is all the time we have for questions. Do you have any closing remarks? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. I want to thank all of you guys for following us. We had a record year, a record quarter. And most importantly, we're at the beginning of the AI computing revolution. This is a new form of computing, new way of computing, where parallel data processing is vital to success, and GPU computing that we've been nurturing for the last decade and some is really the perfect computing approach. We're seeing tremendous growth and exciting growth in the data center market. Datacenter now represents, had grew 3x over year-over-year, and it's on its way to become a very significant business for us. Gaming is a significant business for us, and longer term, self-driving cars is going to be a really exciting growth opportunity. The thing that has really changed our company, what really defines how our company goes to market today, is really the platform approach, that instead of just building a chip that is industry standard, we created software stacks on top of it to serve vertical markets that we believe will be exciting long term that we can serve. And we find ourselves incredibly well positioned now in gaming, in AI and in self-driving cars. I want to thank all of you guys for following NVIDIA, and have a great year.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I\'ll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results, highlights, and marketplace observations. And then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide some operational highlights. Now, I\'ll turn to our results. Q4 was a good finish to 2016 with bookings, revenue and earnings all in line with guidance and cash flow strong as well. Starting with bookings, our bookings revenue in Q4 was $1.437 billion, which reflects a 7% increase over Q4 of 2015. Relative to our guidance, bookings were at the lower end of our range, primarily due to the lack of new ITWorks deals in the quarter. For the full year, our bookings revenue was $5.446 billion, which is up slightly from a very tough comparable of $5.427 billion in 2015 when bookings grew 28% over 2014. Our revenue backlog ended the year at $15.927 billion, which is up 12% from $14.195 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.258 billion, which is up 7% over Q4 2015, and at the midpoint of our guidance range of $1.225 billion to $1.3 billion. The revenue composition for Q4 was $352 million in system sales, $255 million in support and maintenance, $626 million in services, and $25 million in reimbursed travel. For the full year, revenue grew 8% over 2015 to $4.8 billion. System sales revenue for the quarter was down 8% compared to Q4 2015, driven by declines in technology resale and software, that were partially offset by growth in subscriptions. Note that our guidance had factored in the declines in the technology resale and software, as they both had extremely tough comparables. I would note that software was up nicely sequentially over the lower levels we discussed in Q3. For the full year, system sales revenue decreased by 1% from 2015, but margin percent was up due to the lower mix of technology resale. We believe we are better positioned to grow system sales in 2017, given an easier comparable and a good forecast. Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 18% compared to Q4 2015. Full-year services revenue was up 16% over 2015. This growth is in line with our expectations and continues to reflect good execution by our services organizations. Support and maintenance revenue increased 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 7% over the year-ago quarter to $1.11 billion and non-U.S. revenue grew 8% to $145 million. For the full year, domestic revenue grew 9% and non-U.S. grew 6%. As a preview to the annual update of our detailed business model that we\'ll provide at our Investment Community Meeting on February 21 at HIMSS, I\'d like to provide you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2016. Licensed software decreased 3% to $549 million; technology resale decreased 17% to $274 million; subscriptions increased 14% to $442 million; professional services revenue grew 17% to $1.45 billion; managed services increased 14% to $982 million; support and maintenance was up 4% to $1.016 billion; and reimbursed travel was $89 million, which is up 22%. One thing to note about the slight decline in software for the year, this was largely due to a very tough comparable in 2015, which had a very high level of traditional software revenue that is mostly upfront in nature. Traditional software declined from these elevated levels, and this decline was largely offset by an increase in SaaS revenue, which now represents over 30% of total software revenue. Biggest drivers of the SaaS growth is Population Health. This year, we expect levels of traditional software revenue to remain relatively flat, but we expect ongoing strong growth in SaaS revenue. This should lead to better overall growth in system sales and a continued favorable mix shift to more recurring revenue. Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 82.9%, which is basically flat compared to Q4 2015. Full-year gross margin of 83.8% was up from 83% in 2015. Now I will discuss spending, operating margin, and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense, Health Services acquisition-related amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue and other acquisition-related adjustments, which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release. Looking at operating spending. Our fourth quarter GAAP operating expenses of $831 million were up 11% compared to $749 million in the year-ago period, and included $36 million of expenses related to the voluntary separation plan that we previewed on our Q3 earnings call. Full-year GAAP operating expenses were $3.106 billion, up 7% from $2.893 billion in 2015. Adjusted operating expenses were $749 million, which is up 9% compared to Q4 2015. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to revenue generating associates, which is reflected in the sales and client service expense line that increased 13%. Software development increased 3%, G&A was up 1%, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was down 41%, but this represents only $1 million decline from the $3 million to $2 million as this line excludes Health Services acquisition-related amortization in the non-GAAP view. For the full year, adjusted operating expenses were up 11% to $2.884 billion. Moving to operating margins. Our Q4 GAAP operating margin was 16.9%, compared to 19.3% in the year-ago period, with the VSP being the main reason for the decline. Full-year GAAP operating margin was 19.0% compared to 17.7% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 23.3% in Q4, which is down from 24.7% in the year-ago period. Full-year adjusted operating margin came in at 23.6%, which is down from 24.3% last year. The lack of margin expansion in 2016 is consistent with our original guidance. Going forward, we still see long-term expansion opportunities for margin, but given a headwind created by a large unexpected increase in non-cash software amortization and depreciation expenses, including some that didn\'t come through as quickly as we expected in 2016, and the expected lower growth of traditional software revenue, our guidance for 2017 reflects operating margins of flat to slightly up. We also expect that our margins will be more sensitive to revenue mix in coming years. For example, if we experience an acceleration in our Works businesses in the next couple of years, which we believe is likely, it would contribute positively to revenue growth, but might create a mix that could limit margin expansion. Longer term, however, we believe that this could be more than offset as our SaaS revenue related to Population Health ramps. In addition, the headwind from non-cash expenses should subside after a couple of years, creating another opportunity for margin expansion. As a result of these dynamics, we believe modeling limited margin expansion for the next couple of years would be an appropriate baseline. We\'ll obviously continue to update our view as these dynamics play out, we believe our outlook for operating margins in the mid-20% range and upper single-digit revenue and earnings growth is very solid for a $5 billion company. Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $150 million or $0.44 per diluted share. For the full year, GAAP net earnings were up 18% over 2015 to $636 million or $1.85 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $206 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.61, which is flat compared to Q4 2015, but recall we had a $0.03 tax benefit in Q4 2015. For the full year, adjusted net earnings were $790 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.30, which is up 9% from 2015. The Q4 tax rate was 31%, compared to 27% in the year-ago period. Now, I\'ll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $466 million of total cash and investments, which is down from $837 million in Q3, primarily due to the use of cash for our stock repurchase program. During the quarter, we finished the remaining $100 million of stock repurchases authorized in March of 2016, and executed $400 million out of the $500 million stock repurchase authorized in November of 2016. For the quarter, we repurchased a total of 9.98 million shares at an average price of $50.10. For the year, we repurchased 13.7 million shares for $700 million at an average price of $51. Moving to debt. Our total debt including capital lease obligations was $564 million, which is down slightly compared to Q3. Total receivables ended the quarter at $945 million, which is down from $985 million in Q3. Our Q4 DSO was 69 days, which is down from 76 days in Q3 and 80 days in the year-ago period. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $333 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $132 million, and capitalized software was $65 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $137 million for the quarter. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.156 billion, capital expenditures were $459 million, and capitalized software was $294 million. Full-year free cash flow was $402 million, which is 25% higher than 2015. We are targeting an increase in free cash flow of at least $100 million in 2017, driven largely by an expected decrease in capital expenditures. Now, I\'ll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q1 to be between $1.2 billion and $1.275 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 9% over Q1 of 2016. For the full year, we expect revenue between $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion, reflecting 8% growth over 2016 at the midpoint. We expect Q1 diluted EPS to be $0.57 to $0.59 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 9% growth over Q1 of 2016. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.44 to $2.56, with the midpoint reflecting 9% growth over 2016. Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.125 billion to $1.275 billion. The midpoint reflects 3% growth compared to Q1 of 2016. Note that our Q1 bookings guidance does not contemplate material contributions from ITWorks, but we do expect good contributions from ITWorks for the full year. Our 2017 guidance reflects slightly lower ranges from what we provided based on our preliminary view on our last call. These lower ranges reflect our desire to factor in as much of the unpredictable nature of our business as possible, and to make our guidance attainable as we look to avoid having another year where we miss elements of our guidance. While no guidance can be guaranteed, we believe the ranges we have provided are attainable. For example, we indicated last year that 79% of our guidance midpoint for revenue before reimbursed travel was scheduled to come out of backlog. As we\'ve discussed, we did a good job of delivering this expected revenue from backlog, but fell short on revenue from current year bookings. Looking at 2017, approximately 82% of our guidance midpoint for revenue before reimbursed travel is scheduled to come out of backlog. This 3% difference represents approximately $150 million less reliance on current year bookings than last year. Looking at the earnings guidance, similar to our revenue, we are focused on setting an attainable range. In addition, our current view is that non-cash expenses will increase by more than $70 million in 2017, with a split roughly equal between software amortization and depreciation. We realize we projected a similar increase for 2016, and it ended up only being a little over $50 million. This was in part because we provided that projection before we had finalized our plan, and also because the timing of some amortization started pushing to 2017. As I mentioned, the headwind from non-cash expense increases should subside after a couple of years, since the growth of our capitalized software is moderated, and our capital expenditures are expected to decline. Finally, for bookings, we will continue to provide guidance just one quarter at a time. But I want to make a couple of points. First, we do expect some very large bookings this year, but it may be difficult to precisely predict the timing. We will do our best to provide appropriate guidance ranges, and position ourselves for a higher chance of an upside rather than a downside miss, but there may be some variability in a particular quarter. We do believe, however, we are in a good position for full-year bookings growth based on our pipeline of new EHR and revenue cycle footprint, revenue cycle and other solution white space in our base, and Works opportunities. In summary, we feel like we finished the year on a solid note, and we have a good and attainable outlook for 2017. With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Zane. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I\'ll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I\'ll start with bookings. Our Q4 bookings of $1.44 billion reflects 7% growth over 2015 and bring full-year bookings to above bookings for last year. Given a tough comparable of 28% growth in 2015, we view bookings in 2016 as solid, particularly when you consider the headwinds created by declines in tech resale and ITWorks bookings. I feel good about our ability to grow bookings in 2017, given we are past the technology resale headwind, have a strong outlook for Works bookings, and have a good pipeline for revenue cycle and replacement opportunities. Looking at long-term bookings, 31% of bookings in the quarter were from long-term contracts, reflecting strong managed services bookings and no new ITWorks contracts. For the year, long-term bookings were 30% of total bookings compared to 32% in 2015. In dollars, long-term bookings declined 8% for the year, while the rest of the bookings increased 4%. While 2016 was disappointing from an ITWorks perspective, we believe 2017 will be a strong year with much better contributions from ITWorks later in the year. Even with limited ITWorks bookings, our bookings for the quarter and year included a record number of large contracts. In Q4, 60 contracts were over $5 million, including 35 over $10 million. For 2016, 183 contracts were over $5 million, including 107 over $10 million. The high volume of large contracts reflects ongoing success with hosting, high attach rates of solutions like revenue cycle with EHR purchases, and growing deal sizes in areas like ambulatory and Population Health. From a new client perspective, 37% of bookings this quarter came from outside our core Millennium installed base. For the year, 35% of bookings came from outside our base compared to 36% last year. This sustained high level of new business reflects our ongoing competitiveness and good market activity. Looking ahead, we continue to believe the replacement market will remain active, given the high number of hospitals on legacy platforms, and the pressure to keep up with future regulatory and payment models that many legacy platforms are not well-equipped to handle. Now, I\'ll provide highlights from the quarter and year with – I\'ll start with revenue cycle. 2016 was a very strong year, which included 19% revenue growth and record bookings. This growth was driven by ongoing success of increasing penetration of revenue cycle in our installed base, and also related to our strong levels of new EHR footprints, almost all of which included revenue cycle. This success reflects the significant investments we have made in our revenue cycle solutions, and the focus by providers on achieving clinical driven revenue cycle. Beyond our solutions, we had a strong year in revenue cycle services, driven by acute and ambulatory business office services. Operationally, I believe 2016 was an important year in terms of building on the progress of previous years and strengthening the foundation for further revenue cycle successes. We advanced our capabilities in several important areas, including increasing associate expertise through a revenue cycle certification program, improving our delivery infrastructure, and making many important code enhancements to position our clients for ongoing success. We believe all this hard work positions us well going forward, and our forecast reflects strong growth in 2017. We expect this growth to come from ongoing strength in both solution and services, including some larger RevWorks opportunities that are in our pipeline. Now, I\'ll shift to Population Health. 2016 was a good year for our Population Health service businesses. In total, our Population Health revenues grew 13%, with very strong growth in our HealtheIntent solutions, being partially offset by a decline in revenue from legacy reporting solutions that are part of our total Population Health revenue. We made significant progress in 2016, and we believe we are well-positioned going forward. I believe our vision and solutions are resonating in the market, and we are seeing broad success. Our client base is rapidly expanding and includes a diverse portfolio of clients, including small and large health systems from inside and outside our base, proven leaders in Population Health and those just beginning the journey, health plans, employers, states and governments. This diversity represents the reality of a connected health community and allows us to prove our ability to meet the unique needs of each segment and provide value across the continuum. From a solution standpoint, 2016 was an important year of progress. HealtheRegistries and Scorecards are being widely deployed, HealtheEDW and Analytics are growing quickly, our HealtheCare management solution is now deployed and is important part of most new sales decisions. And Healthe programs went live for the first time, delivering a new level of personalized classification, prediction and population monitoring. HealtheIntent, our unified architecture, remains differentiated and continues to scale to massive population sizes. We\'re now approaching 100 million people and more than 6 petabytes of data. From a marketplace standpoint, we believe we are nearing inflection point. The business models and the health information technology strategies are shifting. The key question for us regarding Population Health has not been if the shift will occur, but when and how fast. Our analysis in concert with industry experts predicts we are just entering the transition with the larger shift from fee-for-service to at-risk models occurring between 2018 and 2020 across the health systems, health plans, Medicare, Medicaid and self-insured providers. This shift brings significant change to the business model of providing care and managing health, and to the necessary information technology support. As we move closer to this shift, we are focused on delivering value for these clients who have already placed their trust in us to ensure they successfully make the transition and thrive in the emerging models. We\'re streamlining our implementations, expanding our solution portfolio to manage high-performance networks, providing tighter provider of workflow integration, actively engaging consumers, supporting enterprise-wide analytics, harvesting data to create new intelligence, and creating an open ecosystem to empower the innovators. We are also building out a portfolio advisory, infrastructure, and operational services to help our clients navigate the journey. As part of our normal annual planning process, we have revisited both our short and long-term Population Health outlook. Near term, we have a significant pipeline of opportunities to exceed the collective amount of business we\'ve signed in the past several years. This demand and our expectations that the shift to at-risk models will accelerate in the next few years makes us feel good about the longer-term goals for Population Health as well. Our operational and sales execution these next few years will be very important, and I feel good about our ability to deliver. Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had another good year, quarter and year. For the year, ambulatory bookings grew 16% over 2015, which is a tough comparable as ambulatory bookings had grown over 50% in 2015. We had 28 displacements of our primary ambulatory competitors. 2016 was a big year for ambulatory business office services and included several displacements of our primary cloud competitor. In the small hospital market, we had a great year with our CommunityWorks offering, adding 26 new footprints and bringing our total number of CommunityWorks clients to more than 150. Our outlook is good with new business activity at all-time high. In addition, our competitiveness is very good, and our win rate was over 60% for the year. We continue to be successful against our primary cloud competitor in this market, and have already had displacement opportunities in situations where they were not able to deliver. Next, I\'d like to provide a quick update on our project for the Department of Defense. Earlier this week, we had a successful first go-live at the Fairchild Air Force Base clinic near Spokane, Washington. There will be more go-live events over the summer. From there, we expect to begin broader deployment over the next several years. This has been an exemplary project so far, and the early success is the result of a great effort by the Department of Defense, Cerner, Liedos, Accenture and other partners. The Department of Defense will have a presence with us at HIMSS, which will give people an opportunity to learn more about what we are doing together. Outside of the U.S., we had a solid finish to the year. Non-U.S. revenue grew 8% for the quarter, this brings full-year non-U.S. revenue growth to 6% for the year, which compares to 9% for domestic revenue. Areas of strength in 2016 include Germany, the Middle East and Ireland. Overall, we are starting to see increased activity outside the U.S. and expect the non-U.S. market to become a more meaningful contributor to our results, given the relatively untapped EHR market, opportunities to roll out our Works business, and other – our Population Health platform. Now, I\'d to provide some observations on the marketplace. Last quarter, I talked to you about the reduced number of hard deadlines and regulatory mandates and how this was impacting our clients\' sense of urgency in some cases. Shortly after we reported, the election results surprised many and led to widespread speculation about the demise of health care IT due to uncertainty surrounding the future of Obamacare and the timing of the shift to value-based care. The election result and ensuing speculation didn\'t really impact our business in Q4, as most of our solutions are at a high strategy level and were relatively unaffected, and this helped us to deliver on all key metrics within our guidance range. As for the new administration, it\'s too early to tell if it will have a material impact going forward. However, we believe the fundamental shift towards value-based care will continue in almost all scenarios. We feel good about our outlook for the year, and believe our guidance range represents solid and attainable growth. In summary, I\'m pleased with our solid results, and believe we are well-positioned for growth in 2017. With that, I\'d like to turn the call over to Mike. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I\'m going to discuss ITWorks and a model we are increasingly using with clients to maximize value creation. I\'ll start with ITWorks. As Zane has already discussed, we did not have a very good year for new ITWorks deals. However, we did have strong sales back into our ITWorks base, establishing important global ITWorks footprint and delivered solid financial results. As a result of this activity and our strong bookings in 2015, our total ITWorks revenue increased 28% in 2016. It\'s important to point out the success of our existing ITWorks clients as that is a key reason we had built such as a large pipeline of new prospects. Overall, our ITWorks clients have the highest client satisfaction levels, are very referencable, and have a high penetration of Cerner solutions, and show very well in industry measures such as EMR adoption model and "Most Wired" recognition. Looking ahead, several opportunities we contemplated in 2016 are lining up for 2017, and these, along with other opportunities in our pipeline, set us up for a strong year. We strongly believe in the ITWorks value proposition and remains appealing to our clients in an environment where they have pressure on operating costs, limited access to IT talent, and the increasing pressure to keep up with IT security issues. Now, I\'d like to discuss another approach to client alignment called a Value Creation Office or VCO. This is a fundamental shift in how we are working together with our clients. We\'re embedding teams to live and work with selected clients to build a deeper understanding of their businesses and the communities they serve. We establish a joint governance process, where we look at organizational improvement opportunities and build business cases for investments to achieve those improvements. As improvements are achieved and value is created, Cerner and the clients share in their financial benefits. Some examples of areas we have had success include coding, infection control, sepsis, VTE prevention, readmissions, ambulatory practice and Population Health. Much of this success is driven by leveraging Cerner technology to optimize workflows and minimize variations in the care processes. Another focus of most of our VCO alignment is creating a business analytics platform for the entire health care enterprise and using it to monitor enterprise performance and assess new opportunities for performance improvement, which then become new opportunities for value creation. So far, we have more than five clients where we have some form of a VCO structure, and we\'ve had success at creating value in all cases. I\'m personally part of the governance committee for one of these clients, and we jointly generated millions of dollars of value in the past year. In summary, I think the VCO model will become increasingly common, as it is a great way to achieve return on technology investments to improve quality and financial performance while creating a tighter alignment between Cerner and our clients. With that, I\'ll turn the call over to questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator And our first question comes from the line of Richard Close with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc. Great. Thank you. Just real quick question. In terms of ITWorks, is that essentially the gating factor in terms of the low end and the high end of your revenue range? And if you could give us some additional, I guess, commentary in terms of why you think ITWorks essentially was pushed out from 2016 to 2017? Thank you. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Richard, this is Zane. I\'ll take the first part of that question, then I\'ll have Marc do the guidance dialogue. So I\'ll answer the second part of the question. So I look at it and say that talked about there was a bit of a pause in 2016 around some of those major initiatives on the Works side, where they didn\'t have the meaningful used elements at many of our clients, and some of the regulatory elements that we\'re facing them and they got a bit of a reprieve, also the economics were such in 2016, where many of our clients fared better than they had initially anticipated doing in that space. And so some of the pressure was off as related to getting some of those pieces completed. What we saw is actually that we continue to grow the pipeline in that space and continue to move opportunities along, and we see that those are going to close in the upcoming year, and that\'s just been, I would say, just a variance of timing. And I often describe this is the ultimate relationship sale. It\'s literally where these organizations are handing their associates, their employees over to us for rebadge purpose. So those – this is not a situation where you\'re going to have it end of the quarter, kind of a push, these are the ultimate relationship sale, and so, they don\'t necessarily have the same kind of timelines from overall perspective, which makes that a little less predictable overall. But we\'ve seen continued movement along the way, and we feel good about that movement. And we see that 2017 does have some of those regulatory hammers coming up for them, and then the needs to get through some of the – our health care IT projects is there, and we\'ll have meaningfully positioned to deliver on that. Marc? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Hey, Richard, relative to the ITWorks being the difference in the top range of our revenue, keep in mind, ITWorks deals, while they do have some impact in the year with their sign, given that we don\'t foresee a whole lot of Q1 activity in that space, the impact that it\'s going to have on 2017 isn\'t going to be the $200 million difference range that we have in our guidance. What you found, as we talked about the performance of ITWorks in 2016, we had a very strong 2015, and you saw revenue from ITWorks grow about 28% during the year. So, if we have a good strong 2017 in ITWorks, it\'ll certainly feed 2018 revenue, and contribute more strongly there. But it\'s not the sole driver, it\'s certainly is a key driver to growing bookings, and as we\'ve indicated, we expect to do, but it isn\'t going to be the sole source that\'s going to be where we land in our revenue range, that is all matter of driving out obviously the 82% of that revenue that\'s going to come out of backlog, and then driving out the revenue from the current quarter bookings, or the current year bookings, which as we indicated, is because of the 82% less impactful and required than it was in our 2016 original guidance. Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Hey. Good afternoon. I was curious on your comments around Population Health. There was sort of a dual sort of conflicting factor, you had there sort of HealtheIntent products growing a bit faster and some of the legacy products growing slower, is that something that needs to calendarize or is there – can you elaborate on how that dynamic might play out through 2017 and 2018? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So, this is Zane. What I would say is some of those items that we had in there were some of the quality reporting elements in our legacy Pop Health pieces and we\'ve ramped up – or as we\'ve ramped our HealtheAnalytics and Enterprise Data Warehouse, that\'s going to outpace the growth on some of those pieces. So that trend will continue. We expect the growth on the newer solution set to far outpace the decline in the legacy solutions as we move forward. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Okay. And maybe just one other question. It sounds like – on the revenue cycle side, where – can you maybe qualitatively or quantitatively describe kind of where you are sort of penetration-wise into the core base, to give us a sense of the cross-sell over the next couple years? Because it sound like that\'s a near-term opportunity. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So, our core base, we\'re now at over 200 sites. So, we are – which is impressive from a scale perspective, but that\'s still a little less than 50% of our total population, and so it allows for quite a bit of future cross-sell and particularly on the large side. So as we have moved up in the revenue cycle scale, these tend to be larger opportunities for us as we move forward, and you\'ve just seen us begin to really impact that marketplace in a larger IDN segment, and so, that\'s where some of the big opportunities remain on that side. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. And this is Marc. I think probably closer to 30% penetration today relative to revenue cycle opportunities, as we\'re selling back into our base. So, it still remains one of our strongest white space opportunity. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Okay, thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to follow up and just try to reconcile, Zane, a couple of the comments that you made, one, being too early to tell what the changes in the new administration are going to have with your expectation for high volume of some large contracts. Can you maybe just help us to understand the visibility you have around these high volume contracts, and you talked about, I think, Marc had said 82% or 83% is coming from backlog versus actual bookings. Do you need one of these high-volume large contracts to come through, as we think about the numbers for this year? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Lisa, as I spoke about that, what I\'m really relating to is any impact from the change from a fee-for-service world to really a more value orientation. We have not seen any impact from the election or the change in the administration, although obviously, the administration is not fully in place at this point. And so to understand, if there is going to be any kind of impact, it\'s hard for us to see. What we did see in Q4 was actually no disruption, even though that was probably the bigger shock to the system, if you will. Because what we\'re working on are these very strategic elements. And so, I would say that we did not experience any impact from that, and we\'re not – at this point, we\'re not anticipating, but we don\'t know what the impact of the administration will be at this point. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Lisa, this is Marc. Relative to a large contract, some of the opportunities we talked about, a lot of those are going to be Works opportunities. So, many of them are going to be relative to – from a revenue standpoint as I indicated earlier, they don\'t necessarily contribute a whole lot of revenue in the year in which they are signed, and to the extent that they\'re ITWorks, they don\'t contribute a lot just from that services component to the bottom line. So obviously, there are things that go along with those deals, including software and other higher margin services. But – so, we\'re not going into the year having to go land a bunch of whales, we see them out there, and we expect to bring them in as we increase our bookings over the prior year, bring in at least a few of those. But from the guidance on the financial statement side, we\'re not counting on – don\'t need those big ones to come in to drive those numbers. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. That\'s helpful. And then, Marc, if I can just ask a follow-up question on tax. The tax benefit we saw in the fourth quarter, was that something that you had anticipated when you gave us kind of thoughts and guidance going into the fourth quarter on the third quarter call? Or was that just something that I missed and you anticipated, or was there something that you said an incremental benefit in the fourth quarter on the tax side? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. And the tax rate will move around based on several things, including the size of (39:15) foreign earnings and revenues. So, a 1% change in that isn\'t going to make a whole difference, I mean, basically kind of low 30% is where we expect our tax rate to usually land. So – especially at the end of the year, everything gets trued up, so I don\'t know that we would have been specific about being able to tell you exactly the tax rate we expected, because we don\'t really know the precise number until after we close the books, and we do all the U.S., non-U.S. and all the related tax work. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. That\'s helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sean Dodge with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC Thanks, and good afternoon. Marc, going back to the 2017 revenue target, and bridging your preliminary view with the formal guidance you guys gave this afternoon, you mentioned wanting to take a more conservative approach. Is it as simple as that or are there some actual shifts you are seeing in backlog timing or the market that are kind of behind this lower target? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. I think that obviously, our approach is we did not have a completed plan in place when we talked to you back in Q3. We\'ve had a chance to go through and do all of that detail work including the detailed backlog, and as we land our plan, the good news is that based on the midpoint of the revenue – of our revenue guidance, is that a higher percentage of that is coming out of backlog, which we did actually a very good job of delivering in 2016. The shortfall in 2016 was from new bookings, and so I guess I would characterize our plan in our guidance that we\'re providing as being less reliant on the contribution from those new bookings. So, it wasn\'t a negative shift. We certainly feel, as we\'ve been talking to investors, that we wanted to make sure our guidance felt good to us, that there was perhaps slightly more conservatism to it than we might have had in the past, and I think the guidance we have in place right now is highly attainable, and once again, appropriately has a focus on driving more revenue from backlog as a percent than we did in 2016. Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC Okay. Thank you. And then, Zane, it\'s been a little while since we\'ve got an update on the migration of health services clients over to Millennium. Are you willing to share some updates there, and maybe how many sites are still left to migrate, and maybe even how the revenue profile of those clients that have migrated have changed? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. The win rate has been very good and has really stayed with our expectations as we started the transaction two years ago. And it\'s very much in line, actually a little bit ahead of our core win rates, and so kind of the losses we had were early and expected and those were already in-flight elements. So the win rate has continued to improve as time has gone by, and that\'s a reflection of both our competitiveness, as well as the way we have serviced those clients over time. And so, we are about halfway through the migration of those clients overall, and it\'s across the board in terms of the type of client that has made a switch, so that\'s from large organizations all the way down to the smallest organizations. And our win rates are in the 80 percentile as we see those today. So there is a good opportunity still as we move forward for about half of those clients. Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC Great. Thanks, again. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. As we move forward, guys, if we could try to limit to just one question. I know we have a lot of people in the queue and love to give everybody a chance to ask a question. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Greg Bolan with Avondale Partners. Your line is now open. Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC Hey, thanks, guys. And I wanted, I mean, we obviously are now sitting on a year or so following the Siemens acquisition, and obviously some volatility in guidance there, and I get that you guys are trying to do bigger things, hospitals are requiring bigger things, and obviously, longer term from a financial perspective, it\'s going to burn differently off the backlog, then kind of the software laden days of the – I guess, post HITECH Act. But I guess, as you think about the coverage that you have for 2017, Marc, I think you\'d mentioned it, is it uptick you\'re kind of pushing that up 300 basis points around 82%? I mean, and maybe Richard kind of asked this earlier. But maybe I could just ask it a little bit more pointedly. What could go wrong here? And obviously, what could go right? But I guess, the former, what could go wrong just in terms of this updated guidance, and what kind of shocks have you kind of built into the numbers? Thanks. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. And I think, clearly, this is guidance we can\'t predict the future, obviously, if we did, we did a bad job of it in 2015 and 2016. So I think that for us, we have a very robust planning process. We went through it, as we always do. I think we took a little bit tighter look at things. We tried to do balance things a little bit more towards the size of conservatism. But I think that the way things landed with our backlog being 82% of revenue, feels really good. I mean, it\'s a big number. The guidance we had out there is a big number, and to have a higher percent of it coming from our backlog gives me a good feeling, and we did a good job of delivering that. So, I think, that feels really good. In this business, it\'s all about we sign a lot of new contracts during the year, billions of dollars. And so, it\'s all about the marketplace being there, people being ready to buy, and us offering the solutions and services that the market needs. And based on our pipeline, we have lot of expressed interest of people that are looking to take advantage of our solutions. We\'re fortunate that there\'s a significant portion of the market out there that is going to make an EHR decision, which would not be something you would have expected this far down the high-tech access line (46:12). So, I think that the marketplace is there, the opportunities are there, and the solutions we are bringing to market including All Health, (46:19) including our ITWorks that actually drive real value for the client. I think we\'re well-positioned. Anything can disrupt that, but I don\'t – our view is that our clients aren\'t seeing the changes in administration as being a near-term impact, it\'s something that they have to honker down. Everything I read says they\'re going to still continue to spend on capital. Every conversation we have with them says that they\'re going to continue to spend capital. And as long as they\'re spending, we have the things that are going to make them more efficient and better prepared for the future. So we have the opportunities, we\'ve seen them expressed in our pipeline, but we have to go deliver those new bookings. So the risk as always for every year, and as it was in 2016, we\'re delivering on the new bookings. Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC Fair enough. Thanks, Marc. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I just want to dig a little bit deeper into the 2017 kind of margin expectations, because I think that\'s probably the biggest delta relative to your old guidance of kind of 50 to 100 basis points to now kind of flattish, and your comments surrounding Works deals perhaps being lower margin upfront, what gives you confidence that after several years of margin degradation, now we can stem the bleeding in 2017? Thanks. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. I wouldn\'t know that it\'s margin degradation, because I think we\'ve had flat margin this year compared to last year, we have – midpoint of our guidance let\'s say we have slight increase, it certainly isn\'t the 50 to 100 basis points that we\'ve talked about previously. I think you\'ve kind of seen us and have a history of kind of growing revenue and then growing margin. I think, in this case, we\'ve got a little bit of a headwind because we have written a lot of new solutions, a lot of those are coming on line in 2017, which is going to impact us from an amortization standpoint, so we do have $70 million impact from a non-cash, that if you take – if you parse our 100 basis points down to 50 points coming from expenses and 50 points coming from the revenue side, that eats up a lot of the expense benefit that we would expect to see in the year. So – but on the ITWorks, the history we have certainly in our hosting business, is to start out with the business that our clients need, that they don\'t really want to do, that starts out if you just look at just the services component as a high single-digit, low double-digit margin, and then grow that to 20 to 30-plus percent because of centralization, because of the implementation of tools and processes that make that much more effective than an individual client can do on their own. And we think that ITWorks, and we think the RevWorks are two of those businesses that are well suited to our style of centralization and leverage. So, I think that certainly in 2017, we want to be way upfront and say that because of the headwinds with the amortization, because of the potential – we\'re not projecting that we\'re going to have a lot of extra bump from extra software, we\'re trying to be somewhat conservative and assuming that\'s kind of flat to this year or which is down over last year. So, I think all of those taken into account, being able to hold our margins around 24% while driving top line and earnings at a 9% rate midpoint, feels like a reasonable position to be in, and then have the opportunity as we roll forward in 2018 and 2019 and still we see Pop Health starting to hit, see that SaaS revenue starting to hit with the higher margins. I think we have the opportunity to get back on track to raising margin at that points. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks for the color. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor with Baird. Your line is now open. Matthew D. Gillmor, CFA - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Marc, you talked about your expectations for CapEx to decline about $100 million in 2017, that will obviously help free cash flow. As you look out past 2017, I think you mentioned CapEx should continue to decline while some of those capital projects are completed. So can you give us a sense beyond 2017, where CapEx should trend over the next couple years? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. I think as you said that we expect kind of the capital impact and certainly free cash flow, we expect to grow $100 million year-over-year from 2016 to 2017, the majority of that coming from reduced CapEx, primarily related to new campus that we\'re just opening currently. I think, as we look forward, the only reason that we – one of the reasons we incurred CapEx particularly on buildings is to add people that are going to be revenue producing. So, certainly, anything on the capital side is going to be tied to our growth as a company and the growth of the top line. So I think from relative to 2018 and 2019, I think we don\'t know at what point we\'ll have to start next capital expansion to house additional associates, we have some breathing room now, so hopefully we can kind of through the next couple years without having some of those material impact and that should allow us then to grow free cash flow base at least upon increases in operating cash flow. We\'ll continue to invest in our other businesses, and that\'s really the non-building portion of CapEx. I would expect to see capitalized software to be relatively consistent over that time as well. So, you\'re not going to see a whole lot of growth, but we\'re going to continue to invest in new things, so you won\'t see a whole lot – that going down a lot as a number even if our overall spend in that space stays relatively flat. Matthew D. Gillmor, CFA - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay, great. Thank you. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is now open. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC Hi, good morning, guys. I was trying to – sorry, good afternoon. I was trying to tease out given some of the numbers you provided for some of the higher growth businesses like ITWorks and RevCycle and Pop Health, sort of what the implied core is getting, I was sort of getting to somewhere in the area of about low single digits, 3% or so. Help us understand – I think when you talked at your last Analyst Meeting around the current trajectory in the core, it was supposed to be close to the mid singles, how do you parse out sort of the differences and is my math off or not? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. I think your math is a little higher than that. So I think your numbers are a little bit low, and I think it will – it\'s closer to the numbers we talked about the kind of the mid single digits from a growth perspective. Obviously at HIMSS, we\'ll try to give you a little bit – we give you more color on giving – showing you the lines of business, which will help obviously talk a little bit about our longer-term growth opportunities. But I think if you look at the math, it\'s probably about 4% to 5% of core. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC Got it. Thanks. And maybe just quickly, how much debate was there internally as you obviously decided to do guidance in a way that certainly made it more achievable or a band that seems more comfortable to you? How much debate was there on then, what to do on the margin side and on free cash flow, because obviously, there\'s always the trade-off of growth versus profitability, and I know you see huge runway still ahead, but the market also likes to see progress on both elements, and obviously this year, it\'s a bit tougher as you said on the margin side. But how much of that was sort of debated or were you still just so comfortable in those long-term opportunities you thought the investments needed still to fund that are probably the priority? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, no, I think as we look at the company, we\'re looking at a company of almost $5 billion revenue, we\'re growing top line 9%, we\'re growing earnings 9%. I\'m not sure the universe of companies that are doing that, but it\'s probably not big. So I think the results are pretty good. It took me a long time, I\'ve been CFO here for plenty some years, and it takes a while to realize you have to invest in the IP and in the innovation, because we\'re certainly excited about the things that are starting to become in the windshield (55:05) like Pop Health and our RevCycle. But there are other – lots of other opportunities when you\'re at the intersection of health care and IT that we\'re investing in. We\'re not talking to you guys about it, but we\'re investing in those things as well because that\'s going to drive this business. We\'re not at a point where we need to be saying okay, well, our growth is going to be constrained, so we need to really start to figure out how we drive to the bottom line, we actually do that. You won\'t see it, but last year, when our initial guidance was roughly $200 million high on revenue, the spend we had for the year was roughly $100 million less than we had originally planned because we managed the heck out of spending here, but we actually do spend on things that are going to drive future growth. So, it\'s really wasn\'t much of a debate, I think, this management team is very aligned on growth through innovation, not through acquisition, and this plan absolutely supports that type of a strategy. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC Helpful. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Halper with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Hi. Just two housekeeping questions. You talked about 30% of software revenue is SaaS based, did I hear that right? How fast is that base growing? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yes, Steve, you heard that right. And obviously, SaaS is kind of – it\'s the Pop Health and some of our newer offerings. So, as a percent growth, it\'s growing fairly quickly. So – but once again, just to clarify, it\'s not getting rid of existing perpetual license and traditional licensed software. It is really primarily in new things we\'re offering like Pop Health, that is the key driver for that SaaS, certainly it\'s an offering that we can offer to other clients as well, but it\'s not a matter of we\'re going to be converting to that model so it\'s going to have an impact on us, particularly given the contribution we get from traditional license today. Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Right. So what else is included in that 30% number? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Primarily it will be the Population Health, it\'ll basically be the CommunityWorks model that we do, and then there would be some level of – those are the two that are primarily the biggest. There\'s also some ambulatory to the extent that our PowerWorks model is centrally hosted as well. So, those three are 95% of that SaaS number. Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. So, again, so it\'s 30% of total software, right? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Correct. Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Garro with William Blair. Your line is now open. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Want to ask about that Value Creation Office offering that Mike mentioned, could you talk a little bit more about the business and revenue model there? Are those long-term contracts, then should we think about the revenue stream as recurring in nature? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, this is Marc. For the Value Creation Office, the primary concept is an investment with the client in a group that\'s going to focus on leveraging the solutions that we\'ve implemented in a way that drives value. We invest in that office, they invest in that office, and then we baseline elements, there\'s a project created. The dollars that are driven from that, the value created, first are used to offset the cost of that office, and then after that, they\'re shared in some form with our client, is that correct, Mike? Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. Yeah, that is correct, Marc. And these arrangements, typically the revenue doesn\'t just drive out in a single year, I think that\'s your question. These typically are arrangements that deliver revenue over a period of time. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. And they usually are project based. So each element of revenue is going to come from specific projects we\'re working on; over time that will become somewhat recurring in nature because the number of projects that we create, that office fee will be a pretty – there\'ll be a backlog of those that we can predict. So, it will be highly visible, but it may not be as recurring. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is now open. David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi. Thank you. I\'m not sure I got this all right. But it sounds like the margin, your expectation is flattish to modestly up due to higher non-cash expenses. So, if that\'s right, why is the improvement in free cash flow tied primarily to the reduction in CapEx? And if it\'s related to ITWorks\' mix shift, perhaps you could help us better understand the cash flow characteristic of that business? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. It\'s not related to the cash flow. Certainly, the improvement in free cash flow next year will come from one, improvements in operating cash flow. So, basically, earnings coming through, plus lower CapEx. So it\'s a combination of both of those things that will hit free cash flow (60:54) and we\'re just putting out $100 million bogey as a number, but that would include both CapEx and operating cash flow. ITWorks isn\'t a capital-intensive business. We basically re-badge the in-place workforce, we do not buy their equipment, we do not buy their computers, we don\'t buy their facilities. So there isn\'t a capital outlay. It\'s all basically bringing those people over to us, and then working on our ability to create leverage in their model, centralize some of the activities that are occurring on their side because of either a lack of being able to get capabilities in the local geographies in which they\'re located. But that business does not require a lot of capital. The main business we have that\'s CapEx intensive is our hosting business and our data center business, that\'s the one that really is – most of our capital expenditure is outside of the building CapEx. David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hi. Thanks. So I guess everything\'s been asked, but not everyone has asked it here. Marc, are you conceding on double-digit revenue growth, or is there a path back to double-digit revenue growth that you see in the coming years? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Hey, Sean. As we look at it, I\'m kind of giving you the view of what I think 2017 looks like, and that certainly includes in our range potential for double-digit growth. As we look at it, the opportunities, especially as we start to get into a Pop Health world where that starts ramping up in a significant fashion and having larger contribution is that – and as we start looking at the opportunities, I mean, ITWorks, large ITWorks, large RevWorks deals have the ability to bring $100 million plus of annual revenue into the income statement. So, in a year, as we start bringing those, as we start getting those into the fold, certainly, I foresee times when we – time in the future when we can have double-digit revenue growth. Zane? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. And I would say the Pop Health solutions as well, where we\'re looking at more business in 2017 than we have seen in our history to date. So, the pickup of those kinds of business as we move forward, as they come on line, we\'re going to anticipate this as a double digit. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yes, Sean. As I look at our long-term plan, certainly looks at double-digit growth. It may not be double-digit every year, and I think that 2017 is one of those years where it\'s not double-digit, but it\'s 9%, which is pretty close. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. And then another quick one, of the $0.10 – or a quick one, of the $0.10 reduction of EPS midpoint-to-midpoint, how much of that is cash versus non-cash? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Well, I mean, the majority of it would be non-cash, $70 million of amortization expense. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. Thank you. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Sure. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I think this might have been Sean\'s third question, if you got into it. But Marc, I guess, are the years of the 100 to 150 basis point margin expansion kind of also behind this kind of come from the 2018 or 2019, it sounds like you\'re talking about a more prolonged period of more tempered margin expansion. I want to make sure I understood that right. And I\'ll ask a follow-up question quickly, Zane, which is just you talked about a couple of big deals that you guys are targeting for 2017, what\'s the risk to guidance, if they\'re somehow pushed to 2018? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. This is more on – from an op margin perspective, a lot of this 2017 and most potential 2018 impact is just ramped up amortization of things we – or the innovation spend we have, so kind of the R&D. Once that flattens and is assimilated to the numbers, especially as we start growing in these other businesses, particularly Pop Health, which has high margins, yeah, I\'m not done saying – thinking that we\'re going to be able to grow margins 150 to 100 basis points a year. We just have a period now, but because of the non-cash impact, that\'s going to be tough and we want to make sure we tell people. So... George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Marc, does that mean that software cap rate then, we should expect to see calm down over the next couple years? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. I think the amount of software we capitalize is going to calm down and given that the total amount that we spend on R&D probably doesn\'t change a whole lot, I think you\'ll see that normalize over time. We\'re still going to spend a lot of money on new stuff, but from a dollar amount, that\'s going to – should flatten over time and therefore is that any time you start flattening the R&D, the amortization catches up, or basically your net cap – your net R&D is relatively flat, and I\'d say that without doing the math. So I\'d have to go do the math and make sure. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Understood. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. I know the capitalization goes down, but I\'d say, I don\'t know if it\'s going to increase. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. And George, this is Zane. On your part B of your one question, I would say, well, we said is there\'s no IT at large new ITWorks deals on our Q1 guidance, that\'s all the bookings guidance we\'re providing in our growth models, providing one quarter at a time. We do anticipate ITWorks business in 2017. I do anticipate that it\'s going to be much more aligned with 2015 numbers. Around ITWorks, as it relates to our guidance, there\'s always that risk for any deals that we forecast if anything pushes as part of that process. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. That\'s from a bookings forecast. From a financial statement, from the earnings and revenue, ITWorks once again doesn\'t have as big of an impact... Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. That\'s correct. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. The current year. So, the large deals we\'re talking about aren\'t going to have a material impact on our top line and bottom line. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Appreciate that color, guys. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. How about we take one last question? Operator Certainly. And our last question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC All right. Thanks for slipping me in here. Maybe just one quick one, Zane, on the VA. Could you give us an update on time horizon for them to make a decision, what\'s the latest and greatest you guys are hearing, could it be anything in 2017 or are we thinking that\'s more of a 2018 event or beyond? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Well, I see that more as a 2018 or beyond dialogue, obviously the conversations are very positive. Our objective is to do really great work with the DoD. And I think we\'re absolutely on the right track. The conversations we\'ve had with the VA have been productive, as part of that dialogue, but that\'s a speculative piece, as we look forward. We like our position very much. We know that the biggest thing for us is to continue to execute around the DoD, and that\'s exactly what we\'re doing. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Well, thanks, everyone for joining us. We believe we\'ve laid out a very attainable path to having a great year in 2017, and we look forward to seeing you all at HIMSS. Thank you.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': "Operator And our first question comes from the line of Richard Close with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc. Great. Thank you. Just real quick question. In terms of ITWorks, is that essentially the gating factor in terms of the low end and the high end of your revenue range? And if you could give us some additional, I guess, commentary in terms of why you think ITWorks essentially was pushed out from 2016 to 2017? Thank you. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Richard, this is Zane. I'll take the first part of that question, then I'll have Marc do the guidance dialogue. So I'll answer the second part of the question. So I look at it and say that talked about there was a bit of a pause in 2016 around some of those major initiatives on the Works side, where they didn't have the meaningful used elements at many of our clients, and some of the regulatory elements that we're facing them and they got a bit of a reprieve, also the economics were such in 2016, where many of our clients fared better than they had initially anticipated doing in that space. And so some of the pressure was off as related to getting some of those pieces completed. What we saw is actually that we continue to grow the pipeline in that space and continue to move opportunities along, and we see that those are going to close in the upcoming year, and that's just been, I would say, just a variance of timing. And I often describe this is the ultimate relationship sale. It's literally where these organizations are handing their associates, their employees over to us for rebadge purpose. So those – this is not a situation where you're going to have it end of the quarter, kind of a push, these are the ultimate relationship sale, and so, they don't necessarily have the same kind of timelines from overall perspective, which makes that a little less predictable overall. But we've seen continued movement along the way, and we feel good about that movement. And we see that 2017 does have some of those regulatory hammers coming up for them, and then the needs to get through some of the – our health care IT projects is there, and we'll have meaningfully positioned to deliver on that. Marc? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Hey, Richard, relative to the ITWorks being the difference in the top range of our revenue, keep in mind, ITWorks deals, while they do have some impact in the year with their sign, given that we don't foresee a whole lot of Q1 activity in that space, the impact that it's going to have on 2017 isn't going to be the $200 million difference range that we have in our guidance. What you found, as we talked about the performance of ITWorks in 2016, we had a very strong 2015, and you saw revenue from ITWorks grow about 28% during the year. So, if we have a good strong 2017 in ITWorks, it'll certainly feed 2018 revenue, and contribute more strongly there. But it's not the sole driver, it's certainly is a key driver to growing bookings, and as we've indicated, we expect to do, but it isn't going to be the sole source that's going to be where we land in our revenue range, that is all matter of driving out obviously the 82% of that revenue that's going to come out of backlog, and then driving out the revenue from the current quarter bookings, or the current year bookings, which as we indicated, is because of the 82% less impactful and required than it was in our 2016 original guidance. Richard Collamer Close - Canaccord Genuity Group, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Hey. Good afternoon. I was curious on your comments around Population Health. There was sort of a dual sort of conflicting factor, you had there sort of HealtheIntent products growing a bit faster and some of the legacy products growing slower, is that something that needs to calendarize or is there – can you elaborate on how that dynamic might play out through 2017 and 2018? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So, this is Zane. What I would say is some of those items that we had in there were some of the quality reporting elements in our legacy Pop Health pieces and we've ramped up – or as we've ramped our HealtheAnalytics and Enterprise Data Warehouse, that's going to outpace the growth on some of those pieces. So that trend will continue. We expect the growth on the newer solution set to far outpace the decline in the legacy solutions as we move forward. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Okay. And maybe just one other question. It sounds like – on the revenue cycle side, where – can you maybe qualitatively or quantitatively describe kind of where you are sort of penetration-wise into the core base, to give us a sense of the cross-sell over the next couple years? Because it sound like that's a near-term opportunity. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So, our core base, we're now at over 200 sites. So, we are – which is impressive from a scale perspective, but that's still a little less than 50% of our total population, and so it allows for quite a bit of future cross-sell and particularly on the large side. So as we have moved up in the revenue cycle scale, these tend to be larger opportunities for us as we move forward, and you've just seen us begin to really impact that marketplace in a larger IDN segment, and so, that's where some of the big opportunities remain on that side. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. And this is Marc. I think probably closer to 30% penetration today relative to revenue cycle opportunities, as we're selling back into our base. So, it still remains one of our strongest white space opportunity. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Okay, thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to follow up and just try to reconcile, Zane, a couple of the comments that you made, one, being too early to tell what the changes in the new administration are going to have with your expectation for high volume of some large contracts. Can you maybe just help us to understand the visibility you have around these high volume contracts, and you talked about, I think, Marc had said 82% or 83% is coming from backlog versus actual bookings. Do you need one of these high-volume large contracts to come through, as we think about the numbers for this year? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Lisa, as I spoke about that, what I'm really relating to is any impact from the change from a fee-for-service world to really a more value orientation. We have not seen any impact from the election or the change in the administration, although obviously, the administration is not fully in place at this point. And so to understand, if there is going to be any kind of impact, it's hard for us to see. What we did see in Q4 was actually no disruption, even though that was probably the bigger shock to the system, if you will. Because what we're working on are these very strategic elements. And so, I would say that we did not experience any impact from that, and we're not – at this point, we're not anticipating, but we don't know what the impact of the administration will be at this point. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Lisa, this is Marc. Relative to a large contract, some of the opportunities we talked about, a lot of those are going to be Works opportunities. So, many of them are going to be relative to – from a revenue standpoint as I indicated earlier, they don't necessarily contribute a whole lot of revenue in the year in which they are signed, and to the extent that they're ITWorks, they don't contribute a lot just from that services component to the bottom line. So obviously, there are things that go along with those deals, including software and other higher margin services. But – so, we're not going into the year having to go land a bunch of whales, we see them out there, and we expect to bring them in as we increase our bookings over the prior year, bring in at least a few of those. But from the guidance on the financial statement side, we're not counting on – don't need those big ones to come in to drive those numbers. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. That's helpful. And then, Marc, if I can just ask a follow-up question on tax. The tax benefit we saw in the fourth quarter, was that something that you had anticipated when you gave us kind of thoughts and guidance going into the fourth quarter on the third quarter call? Or was that just something that I missed and you anticipated, or was there something that you said an incremental benefit in the fourth quarter on the tax side? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. And the tax rate will move around based on several things, including the size of (39:15) foreign earnings and revenues. So, a 1% change in that isn't going to make a whole difference, I mean, basically kind of low 30% is where we expect our tax rate to usually land. So – especially at the end of the year, everything gets trued up, so I don't know that we would have been specific about being able to tell you exactly the tax rate we expected, because we don't really know the precise number until after we close the books, and we do all the U.S., non-U.S. and all the related tax work. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sean Dodge with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC Thanks, and good afternoon. Marc, going back to the 2017 revenue target, and bridging your preliminary view with the formal guidance you guys gave this afternoon, you mentioned wanting to take a more conservative approach. Is it as simple as that or are there some actual shifts you are seeing in backlog timing or the market that are kind of behind this lower target? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. I think that obviously, our approach is we did not have a completed plan in place when we talked to you back in Q3. We've had a chance to go through and do all of that detail work including the detailed backlog, and as we land our plan, the good news is that based on the midpoint of the revenue – of our revenue guidance, is that a higher percentage of that is coming out of backlog, which we did actually a very good job of delivering in 2016. The shortfall in 2016 was from new bookings, and so I guess I would characterize our plan in our guidance that we're providing as being less reliant on the contribution from those new bookings. So, it wasn't a negative shift. We certainly feel, as we've been talking to investors, that we wanted to make sure our guidance felt good to us, that there was perhaps slightly more conservatism to it than we might have had in the past, and I think the guidance we have in place right now is highly attainable, and once again, appropriately has a focus on driving more revenue from backlog as a percent than we did in 2016. Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC Okay. Thank you. And then, Zane, it's been a little while since we've got an update on the migration of health services clients over to Millennium. Are you willing to share some updates there, and maybe how many sites are still left to migrate, and maybe even how the revenue profile of those clients that have migrated have changed? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. The win rate has been very good and has really stayed with our expectations as we started the transaction two years ago. And it's very much in line, actually a little bit ahead of our core win rates, and so kind of the losses we had were early and expected and those were already in-flight elements. So the win rate has continued to improve as time has gone by, and that's a reflection of both our competitiveness, as well as the way we have serviced those clients over time. And so, we are about halfway through the migration of those clients overall, and it's across the board in terms of the type of client that has made a switch, so that's from large organizations all the way down to the smallest organizations. And our win rates are in the 80 percentile as we see those today. So there is a good opportunity still as we move forward for about half of those clients. Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC Great. Thanks, again. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. As we move forward, guys, if we could try to limit to just one question. I know we have a lot of people in the queue and love to give everybody a chance to ask a question. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Greg Bolan with Avondale Partners. Your line is now open. Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC Hey, thanks, guys. And I wanted, I mean, we obviously are now sitting on a year or so following the Siemens acquisition, and obviously some volatility in guidance there, and I get that you guys are trying to do bigger things, hospitals are requiring bigger things, and obviously, longer term from a financial perspective, it's going to burn differently off the backlog, then kind of the software laden days of the – I guess, post HITECH Act. But I guess, as you think about the coverage that you have for 2017, Marc, I think you'd mentioned it, is it uptick you're kind of pushing that up 300 basis points around 82%? I mean, and maybe Richard kind of asked this earlier. But maybe I could just ask it a little bit more pointedly. What could go wrong here? And obviously, what could go right? But I guess, the former, what could go wrong just in terms of this updated guidance, and what kind of shocks have you kind of built into the numbers? Thanks. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. And I think, clearly, this is guidance we can't predict the future, obviously, if we did, we did a bad job of it in 2015 and 2016. So I think that for us, we have a very robust planning process. We went through it, as we always do. I think we took a little bit tighter look at things. We tried to do balance things a little bit more towards the size of conservatism. But I think that the way things landed with our backlog being 82% of revenue, feels really good. I mean, it's a big number. The guidance we had out there is a big number, and to have a higher percent of it coming from our backlog gives me a good feeling, and we did a good job of delivering that. So, I think, that feels really good. In this business, it's all about we sign a lot of new contracts during the year, billions of dollars. And so, it's all about the marketplace being there, people being ready to buy, and us offering the solutions and services that the market needs. And based on our pipeline, we have lot of expressed interest of people that are looking to take advantage of our solutions. We're fortunate that there's a significant portion of the market out there that is going to make an EHR decision, which would not be something you would have expected this far down the high-tech access line (46:12). So, I think that the marketplace is there, the opportunities are there, and the solutions we are bringing to market including All Health, (46:19) including our ITWorks that actually drive real value for the client. I think we're well-positioned. Anything can disrupt that, but I don't – our view is that our clients aren't seeing the changes in administration as being a near-term impact, it's something that they have to honker down. Everything I read says they're going to still continue to spend on capital. Every conversation we have with them says that they're going to continue to spend capital. And as long as they're spending, we have the things that are going to make them more efficient and better prepared for the future. So we have the opportunities, we've seen them expressed in our pipeline, but we have to go deliver those new bookings. So the risk as always for every year, and as it was in 2016, we're delivering on the new bookings. Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC Fair enough. Thanks, Marc. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I just want to dig a little bit deeper into the 2017 kind of margin expectations, because I think that's probably the biggest delta relative to your old guidance of kind of 50 to 100 basis points to now kind of flattish, and your comments surrounding Works deals perhaps being lower margin upfront, what gives you confidence that after several years of margin degradation, now we can stem the bleeding in 2017? Thanks. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. I wouldn't know that it's margin degradation, because I think we've had flat margin this year compared to last year, we have – midpoint of our guidance let's say we have slight increase, it certainly isn't the 50 to 100 basis points that we've talked about previously. I think you've kind of seen us and have a history of kind of growing revenue and then growing margin. I think, in this case, we've got a little bit of a headwind because we have written a lot of new solutions, a lot of those are coming on line in 2017, which is going to impact us from an amortization standpoint, so we do have $70 million impact from a non-cash, that if you take – if you parse our 100 basis points down to 50 points coming from expenses and 50 points coming from the revenue side, that eats up a lot of the expense benefit that we would expect to see in the year. So – but on the ITWorks, the history we have certainly in our hosting business, is to start out with the business that our clients need, that they don't really want to do, that starts out if you just look at just the services component as a high single-digit, low double-digit margin, and then grow that to 20 to 30-plus percent because of centralization, because of the implementation of tools and processes that make that much more effective than an individual client can do on their own. And we think that ITWorks, and we think the RevWorks are two of those businesses that are well suited to our style of centralization and leverage. So, I think that certainly in 2017, we want to be way upfront and say that because of the headwinds with the amortization, because of the potential – we're not projecting that we're going to have a lot of extra bump from extra software, we're trying to be somewhat conservative and assuming that's kind of flat to this year or which is down over last year. So, I think all of those taken into account, being able to hold our margins around 24% while driving top line and earnings at a 9% rate midpoint, feels like a reasonable position to be in, and then have the opportunity as we roll forward in 2018 and 2019 and still we see Pop Health starting to hit, see that SaaS revenue starting to hit with the higher margins. I think we have the opportunity to get back on track to raising margin at that points. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks for the color. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor with Baird. Your line is now open. Matthew D. Gillmor, CFA - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Marc, you talked about your expectations for CapEx to decline about $100 million in 2017, that will obviously help free cash flow. As you look out past 2017, I think you mentioned CapEx should continue to decline while some of those capital projects are completed. So can you give us a sense beyond 2017, where CapEx should trend over the next couple years? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. I think as you said that we expect kind of the capital impact and certainly free cash flow, we expect to grow $100 million year-over-year from 2016 to 2017, the majority of that coming from reduced CapEx, primarily related to new campus that we're just opening currently. I think, as we look forward, the only reason that we – one of the reasons we incurred CapEx particularly on buildings is to add people that are going to be revenue producing. So, certainly, anything on the capital side is going to be tied to our growth as a company and the growth of the top line. So I think from relative to 2018 and 2019, I think we don't know at what point we'll have to start next capital expansion to house additional associates, we have some breathing room now, so hopefully we can kind of through the next couple years without having some of those material impact and that should allow us then to grow free cash flow base at least upon increases in operating cash flow. We'll continue to invest in our other businesses, and that's really the non-building portion of CapEx. I would expect to see capitalized software to be relatively consistent over that time as well. So, you're not going to see a whole lot of growth, but we're going to continue to invest in new things, so you won't see a whole lot – that going down a lot as a number even if our overall spend in that space stays relatively flat. Matthew D. Gillmor, CFA - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay, great. Thank you. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is now open. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC Hi, good morning, guys. I was trying to – sorry, good afternoon. I was trying to tease out given some of the numbers you provided for some of the higher growth businesses like ITWorks and RevCycle and Pop Health, sort of what the implied core is getting, I was sort of getting to somewhere in the area of about low single digits, 3% or so. Help us understand – I think when you talked at your last Analyst Meeting around the current trajectory in the core, it was supposed to be close to the mid singles, how do you parse out sort of the differences and is my math off or not? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. I think your math is a little higher than that. So I think your numbers are a little bit low, and I think it will – it's closer to the numbers we talked about the kind of the mid single digits from a growth perspective. Obviously at HIMSS, we'll try to give you a little bit – we give you more color on giving – showing you the lines of business, which will help obviously talk a little bit about our longer-term growth opportunities. But I think if you look at the math, it's probably about 4% to 5% of core. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC Got it. Thanks. And maybe just quickly, how much debate was there internally as you obviously decided to do guidance in a way that certainly made it more achievable or a band that seems more comfortable to you? How much debate was there on then, what to do on the margin side and on free cash flow, because obviously, there's always the trade-off of growth versus profitability, and I know you see huge runway still ahead, but the market also likes to see progress on both elements, and obviously this year, it's a bit tougher as you said on the margin side. But how much of that was sort of debated or were you still just so comfortable in those long-term opportunities you thought the investments needed still to fund that are probably the priority? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, no, I think as we look at the company, we're looking at a company of almost $5 billion revenue, we're growing top line 9%, we're growing earnings 9%. I'm not sure the universe of companies that are doing that, but it's probably not big. So I think the results are pretty good. It took me a long time, I've been CFO here for plenty some years, and it takes a while to realize you have to invest in the IP and in the innovation, because we're certainly excited about the things that are starting to become in the windshield (55:05) like Pop Health and our RevCycle. But there are other – lots of other opportunities when you're at the intersection of health care and IT that we're investing in. We're not talking to you guys about it, but we're investing in those things as well because that's going to drive this business. We're not at a point where we need to be saying okay, well, our growth is going to be constrained, so we need to really start to figure out how we drive to the bottom line, we actually do that. You won't see it, but last year, when our initial guidance was roughly $200 million high on revenue, the spend we had for the year was roughly $100 million less than we had originally planned because we managed the heck out of spending here, but we actually do spend on things that are going to drive future growth. So, it's really wasn't much of a debate, I think, this management team is very aligned on growth through innovation, not through acquisition, and this plan absolutely supports that type of a strategy. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC Helpful. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Halper with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Hi. Just two housekeeping questions. You talked about 30% of software revenue is SaaS based, did I hear that right? How fast is that base growing? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yes, Steve, you heard that right. And obviously, SaaS is kind of – it's the Pop Health and some of our newer offerings. So, as a percent growth, it's growing fairly quickly. So – but once again, just to clarify, it's not getting rid of existing perpetual license and traditional licensed software. It is really primarily in new things we're offering like Pop Health, that is the key driver for that SaaS, certainly it's an offering that we can offer to other clients as well, but it's not a matter of we're going to be converting to that model so it's going to have an impact on us, particularly given the contribution we get from traditional license today. Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Right. So what else is included in that 30% number? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Primarily it will be the Population Health, it'll basically be the CommunityWorks model that we do, and then there would be some level of – those are the two that are primarily the biggest. There's also some ambulatory to the extent that our PowerWorks model is centrally hosted as well. So, those three are 95% of that SaaS number. Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. So, again, so it's 30% of total software, right? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Correct. Steven Halper - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Garro with William Blair. Your line is now open. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Want to ask about that Value Creation Office offering that Mike mentioned, could you talk a little bit more about the business and revenue model there? Are those long-term contracts, then should we think about the revenue stream as recurring in nature? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, this is Marc. For the Value Creation Office, the primary concept is an investment with the client in a group that's going to focus on leveraging the solutions that we've implemented in a way that drives value. We invest in that office, they invest in that office, and then we baseline elements, there's a project created. The dollars that are driven from that, the value created, first are used to offset the cost of that office, and then after that, they're shared in some form with our client, is that correct, Mike? Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. Yeah, that is correct, Marc. And these arrangements, typically the revenue doesn't just drive out in a single year, I think that's your question. These typically are arrangements that deliver revenue over a period of time. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. And they usually are project based. So each element of revenue is going to come from specific projects we're working on; over time that will become somewhat recurring in nature because the number of projects that we create, that office fee will be a pretty – there'll be a backlog of those that we can predict. So, it will be highly visible, but it may not be as recurring. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is now open. David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi. Thank you. I'm not sure I got this all right. But it sounds like the margin, your expectation is flattish to modestly up due to higher non-cash expenses. So, if that's right, why is the improvement in free cash flow tied primarily to the reduction in CapEx? And if it's related to ITWorks' mix shift, perhaps you could help us better understand the cash flow characteristic of that business? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. It's not related to the cash flow. Certainly, the improvement in free cash flow next year will come from one, improvements in operating cash flow. So, basically, earnings coming through, plus lower CapEx. So it's a combination of both of those things that will hit free cash flow (60:54) and we're just putting out $100 million bogey as a number, but that would include both CapEx and operating cash flow. ITWorks isn't a capital-intensive business. We basically re-badge the in-place workforce, we do not buy their equipment, we do not buy their computers, we don't buy their facilities. So there isn't a capital outlay. It's all basically bringing those people over to us, and then working on our ability to create leverage in their model, centralize some of the activities that are occurring on their side because of either a lack of being able to get capabilities in the local geographies in which they're located. But that business does not require a lot of capital. The main business we have that's CapEx intensive is our hosting business and our data center business, that's the one that really is – most of our capital expenditure is outside of the building CapEx. David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hi. Thanks. So I guess everything's been asked, but not everyone has asked it here. Marc, are you conceding on double-digit revenue growth, or is there a path back to double-digit revenue growth that you see in the coming years? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Hey, Sean. As we look at it, I'm kind of giving you the view of what I think 2017 looks like, and that certainly includes in our range potential for double-digit growth. As we look at it, the opportunities, especially as we start to get into a Pop Health world where that starts ramping up in a significant fashion and having larger contribution is that – and as we start looking at the opportunities, I mean, ITWorks, large ITWorks, large RevWorks deals have the ability to bring $100 million plus of annual revenue into the income statement. So, in a year, as we start bringing those, as we start getting those into the fold, certainly, I foresee times when we – time in the future when we can have double-digit revenue growth. Zane? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. And I would say the Pop Health solutions as well, where we're looking at more business in 2017 than we have seen in our history to date. So, the pickup of those kinds of business as we move forward, as they come on line, we're going to anticipate this as a double digit. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yes, Sean. As I look at our long-term plan, certainly looks at double-digit growth. It may not be double-digit every year, and I think that 2017 is one of those years where it's not double-digit, but it's 9%, which is pretty close. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. And then another quick one, of the $0.10 – or a quick one, of the $0.10 reduction of EPS midpoint-to-midpoint, how much of that is cash versus non-cash? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Well, I mean, the majority of it would be non-cash, $70 million of amortization expense. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. Thank you. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Sure. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I think this might have been Sean's third question, if you got into it. But Marc, I guess, are the years of the 100 to 150 basis point margin expansion kind of also behind this kind of come from the 2018 or 2019, it sounds like you're talking about a more prolonged period of more tempered margin expansion. I want to make sure I understood that right. And I'll ask a follow-up question quickly, Zane, which is just you talked about a couple of big deals that you guys are targeting for 2017, what's the risk to guidance, if they're somehow pushed to 2018? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. This is more on – from an op margin perspective, a lot of this 2017 and most potential 2018 impact is just ramped up amortization of things we – or the innovation spend we have, so kind of the R&D. Once that flattens and is assimilated to the numbers, especially as we start growing in these other businesses, particularly Pop Health, which has high margins, yeah, I'm not done saying – thinking that we're going to be able to grow margins 150 to 100 basis points a year. We just have a period now, but because of the non-cash impact, that's going to be tough and we want to make sure we tell people. So... George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Marc, does that mean that software cap rate then, we should expect to see calm down over the next couple years? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. I think the amount of software we capitalize is going to calm down and given that the total amount that we spend on R&D probably doesn't change a whole lot, I think you'll see that normalize over time. We're still going to spend a lot of money on new stuff, but from a dollar amount, that's going to – should flatten over time and therefore is that any time you start flattening the R&D, the amortization catches up, or basically your net cap – your net R&D is relatively flat, and I'd say that without doing the math. So I'd have to go do the math and make sure. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Understood. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. I know the capitalization goes down, but I'd say, I don't know if it's going to increase. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. And George, this is Zane. On your part B of your one question, I would say, well, we said is there's no IT at large new ITWorks deals on our Q1 guidance, that's all the bookings guidance we're providing in our growth models, providing one quarter at a time. We do anticipate ITWorks business in 2017. I do anticipate that it's going to be much more aligned with 2015 numbers. Around ITWorks, as it relates to our guidance, there's always that risk for any deals that we forecast if anything pushes as part of that process. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. That's from a bookings forecast. From a financial statement, from the earnings and revenue, ITWorks once again doesn't have as big of an impact... Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. That's correct. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. The current year. So, the large deals we're talking about aren't going to have a material impact on our top line and bottom line. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Appreciate that color, guys. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. How about we take one last question? Operator Certainly. And our last question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC All right. Thanks for slipping me in here. Maybe just one quick one, Zane, on the VA. Could you give us an update on time horizon for them to make a decision, what's the latest and greatest you guys are hearing, could it be anything in 2017 or are we thinking that's more of a 2018 event or beyond? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Well, I see that more as a 2018 or beyond dialogue, obviously the conversations are very positive. Our objective is to do really great work with the DoD. And I think we're absolutely on the right track. The conversations we've had with the VA have been productive, as part of that dialogue, but that's a speculative piece, as we look forward. We like our position very much. We know that the biggest thing for us is to continue to execute around the DoD, and that's exactly what we're doing. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Well, thanks, everyone for joining us. We believe we've laid out a very attainable path to having a great year in 2017, and we look forward to seeing you all at HIMSS. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Thank you, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I\'ll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results, highlights, and marketplace observations. And then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide some operational highlights. Now I will turn to our results. Q1 was a good start to 2017, with bookings, revenue, and earnings all at the high end of our guidance ranges. Starting with bookings, our bookings in Q1 was $1.25 billion, which reflects a 7% increase over Q1 of 2016. Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $16.098 billion, which is up 10% from $14.615 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.26 billion, which is up 11% over Q1 of 2016, driven by a strong growth in system sales and services. The revenue composition for Q1 was $320 million in system sales, $262 million in support and maintenance, $656 million in services, and $22 million in reimbursed travel. System sales revenue for the quarter was up 14% compared to Q1 of 2016, then driven primarily by strong licensed software growth, as well as solid growth in technology resale. The higher level of software is reflected in the strong system sales margin percent of 68.6%, which is up 50 basis points over Q1 of 2016 and 150 basis points over Q4 of 2016. Moving to services, total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 11% compared to Q1 of 2016. Support and maintenance revenue increased 4% for the quarter, which is in line with our expectations. Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 13% over the year-ago quarter to $1.13 billion and non-U.S. revenue declined 3% to $129 million. On non-U.S. revenue decline, note that currency fluctuations impacted revenue by about 2%, so revenue was basically flat on a constant currency basis. In addition, the primary driver of the lack of growth was a decline in non-U.S. technology resale. Moving to gross margin, our gross margin for Q1 was 84.2% which is basically flat compared to a year ago and up a 130 basis points compared to Q4 of 2016. Now I\'ll discuss spending, operating margin, and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, Health Services acquisition-related amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, and other acquisition-related adjustments which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release. The adjustment for share-based compensation permanent tax items is a new adjustment this year to incorporate a new accounting standard adopted in Q1, which is designed to simplify accounting for share-based compensation. There is more information in our release, but we are basically reducing our adjusted earnings by the amount of the permanent tax benefit, so our results will be comparable to prior periods. In addition, not including this tax benefit should reduce significant swings in our adjusted tax rate that would occur if we did not adjust it out. Looking at operating spending, our first-quarter GAAP operating expenses of $817 million were up 9% compared to $747 million in the year ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were $773 million, which is up 10% compared to Q1 of 2016. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to revenue generating associates, which is reflected in the sales and client service expense line that increased 12%. Software development increased 9%, driven by non-cash items as we had $4 million less capitalized software and $8 million more amortization than Q1 of 2016. G&A expense was up 3%. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased by $1 million. Moving to operating margins, our Q1 GAAP operating margin was 19.4% compared to 18.9% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 22.9% in Q1, which is essentially flat to the year-ago period and in line with previously communicated expectations. Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $173 million or $0.52 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $198 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.59, up 11% from $0.53 in Q1 of 2016. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29%. When excluding the share-based compensation permanent tax items, the Q1 tax rate was 31%, which is basically flat compared to a year ago. Note that we also had a $3.3 million write-down of a venture capital investment as reflected in the other income line. Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $609 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $466 million in Q4. Moving to debt, our total debt, including capital lease obligations, was $550 million, which is down slightly compared to Q4. Total receivables ended the quarter at $986 million, which is up from $945 million in Q4. Our Q1 DSO was 71 days, which is up from 69 days in Q4 and down from 76 days in the year-ago period. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $304 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $88 million, and capitalized software was $71 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $144 million for the quarter. Note that our operating cash flow reflects certain classification changes required by the previously mentioned new accounting standard adopted in Q1. For Q1 2017, this impact resulted in approximately $12 million more operating cash flow than under the prior accounting guidance. We have also recast 2016 cashless to reflect this change, which resulted in Q1 of 2016 operating cash flows increasing by $9 million over what was previously reported. Regarding free cash flow, we still expect to increase our free cash flow by at least $150 million under the prior classification method. It also likely we will drive a similar increase under the new method, unless the tax impact of share-based compensation is materially lower in 2017. Either way, we expect strong free cash flow this year. Finally, you will see that we added a cash flow statement to our press release schedules. Now I\'ll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q2 to be between $1.265 billion and $1.335 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 7% over Q2 of 2016. For the full year we continue to expect revenue between $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion, reflecting 8% growth over 2016 at the midpoint. We expect Q2 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.60 to $0.62 per share, with a midpoint reflecting 5% growth over Q2 of 2016. For the full year, we still expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.44 to $2.56, with a midpoint reflecting 9% growth over 2016. Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. The midpoint is basically flat compared to Q2 of 2016, which is our toughest comparable in 2016. We continue to expect bookings growth for the full year. In summary, we feel like we\'ve started the year on a solid note, and we have a good outlook for the rest of the year. With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Zane. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I\'ll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I\'ll start with bookings. As Marc mentioned earlier, our Q1 bookings of $1.25 billion reflects 7% growth over Q1 of 2016. This growth was achieved without a new Cerner ITWorks contract, which we indicated was our expectation when we provided guidance. In total, 24% of bookings came from long-term contracts, which is flat compared to Q1 of 2016 but below the 30%-plus average for the past several years. As Mike will discuss, we remain confident this will be a good year for Works bookings, with stronger contributions expected to begin next quarter. The main highlight of the quarter was our competitiveness and volume of new footprints, as reflected in 37% of bookings coming from outside our core Millennium installed base. This included multiple head-to-head wins against our primary competitor. A noteworthy example was being selected by a Top 100 health system located in a top 10 metropolitan area for a full suite of acute EHR, ambulatory and Revenue Cycle solutions. Additionally, we were selected by another organization in the Southeast that is one of the largest publicly owned health systems in the U.S. Finally, we continue to see our large health system clients move more of their sites to Cerner as they look to get off legacy systems and standardize on Millennium. One client this quarter contracted to move 10 sites from a competitor\'s legacy system to Cerner Millennium. And we have many more sites that could be transitioned to Cerner in the future. As we have discussed, our health system clients still have a significant number of sites on competitors\' legacy systems that represent future opportunities. Overall, our competitiveness is as good as it\'s ever been. We believe our primary competitor continues to be in a more defensive stance as a result of numerous factors, including cost overruns, that have impacted their clients financially and become more widely known in the marketplace. We also believe that our predictable total cost of ownership, contemporary architecture, ability to demonstrate value, and solid and strong population health capabilities position us to continue having success against this competitor and others. Beyond our strength in new business, we also had good contribution from other growth areas, such as population health and Revenue Cycle, with both positioned to deliver strong double-digit growth for the year. In population health, despite the uncertainty of exactly when the broader shift from fee-for-service to value-based care will occur, there continues to be a high interest in our population health solutions as providers realize they need to begin preparing for the shift long before it occurs. Further, we are able to demonstrate the ability of the HealtheIntent Platform to help our clients optimize performance in their fee-for-service business models while they are also preparing for new reimbursement models. In Revenue Cycle, the strength continues to be driven by both new EHR clients including Revenue Cycle with their purchase, as well as further penetrating our existing EHR base with our Revenue Cycle solutions. We are also seeing increased demand for Revenue Cycle services, including targeted projects, transition services, business office management, and full outsourcing. We also had a solid quarter in smaller venues with our Ambulatory and CommunityWorks offerings. In Ambulatory, we had success with extending our solutions to the ambulatory facilities of our large health system clients, which led to the displacement of several different ambulatory competitors during the quarter. We also had another strong quarter in Ambulatory Business Office Services. In CommunityWorks, we had a solid quarter that included multiple – beating multiple niche competitors. Activity remains high and we have a very good outlook for the year. Next, I\'d like to provide a quick update on our project with the Department of Defense. As we\'ve discussed, we had a successful first go-live earlier this year, and we remain on track for additional go-lives throughout the year. We are honored to be part of this project and we are very pleased with the early success, which is a result of great effort by the Department of Defense, Cerner, Leidos, and other partners. This project is making Cerner better, and I believe it ultimately benefits all our clients and is leading to enhanced implementation processes, advancements in cyber security, and sometimes connected technologies. We remained very focused on continuing to deliver for the Department of Defense, which we believe will help prepare and position us for other opportunities. Moving to our business outside the U.S., despite the flat revenue Mark mentioned, we had a strong start to the year from a bookings standpoint. The strength of bookings was broad-based with over 20% bookings growth in Canada, Australia, Germany, Belgium, and the UK. Of note were two significant academic systems, including our first large client in Belgium and a very significant academic system in Australia. Both were won after rigorous and highly competitive selection processes that included our primary competitor. Now I\'d like to provide some observations on the U.S. marketplace. As I discussed last quarter, while there are unknowns about the future of Obamacare and the timing of the shift to value-based care, we are not seeing this have a material impact on our results. I think it\'s important to step back from the noise and consider that the dialog around Obamacare and its Republican alternatives is mainly focused on access and insurance reform, not care delivery reform. There isn\'t much of a discussion around the cost of care delivery. If not addressed, the cost implications of the baby boomers hitting retirement, increases in chronic conditions, and reimbursement being tied to volume will lead to our healthcare costs continuing to grow as a percent of GDP at an unsustainable rate. We continue to believe information technology is the single biggest lever to drive cost down and quality up. From a policy standpoint, we believe the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, is an important step in the right direction. Unlike meaningful use, which mandated EHR adoption without requiring proof of better outcomes, MACRA rewards providers who achieve better outcomes and penalizes providers who do not. As the payer for roughly 50% of the care in the U.S., the federal government can use their leverage to push towards value-based care, and now that the core system is mostly digital, they can demand the measurements that are needed to do this. With the change in the administration, we are seeing a predictable review, but most policymakers seem confident that MACRA and the overall shift to value-based reimbursement will continue. In our view, based on the forces and pressures that drive healthcare spending, it\'s hard to imagine ignoring the power of shifting from fee-for-service to a value-based system inside a competitive marketplace. And we clearly believe Cerner can play an important role in this shift. In summary, we believe we are well positioned in an active marketplace, with both near-term and long-term drivers of business opportunity for Cerner. With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Mike. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I\'m going to discuss ITWorks and some initiatives that are focused on driving operational efficiencies, while also improving our quality. I\'ll start with ITWorks. As Zane mentioned, and as contemplated in our forecast, we didn\'t have a new ITWorks deal in Q1. However, we did have an existing client expand and extend their ITWorks contract. We also had good sales back into our ITWorks base, which is an important part of our ITWorks model. Despite a lack of recent new deals, the ITWorks value proposition is resonating with many of our clients as we look to control costs, achieve operational excellence, and maintain security across the enterprise. Looking ahead, we believe – we still believe several of the opportunities we contemplated in 2016 will be closed in 2017, and we continue to add opportunities to our pipeline. In total, we believe 2017 could be a record year for ITWorks bookings. Now I\'d like to briefly discuss two examples of initiatives focused on driving quality and efficiency. The first example is our focus on clinician productivity and satisfaction. One of CERN\'s unique competitive advantages is our ability to leverage analytics to understand the user experience within our solutions. With a tool called Cerner Advance, we create the ability to measure the EHR efficiency of each clinician and benchmark them against peers by specialty and venue. This unparalleled ability allows us to proactively identify areas of opportunity, engage with our clients to create data-driven plans for improvement, and measure the impact of these changes. Over 8,000 users and 500 organizations have leveraged this capability to advance their organizations towards best practices that represent more effective and efficient utilization of our solutions. Another example of our focus is making our systems continuously available. One measure of this has been our ability to provide four nines of availability through our leading hosting capabilities. Going beyond this, we are now able to achieve continuous availability even during a Millennium release upgrade. This is significant – this is a significant achievement, and we have already performed many release upgrades without incurring downtime. This accomplishment takes us a step closer towards our goal of continuous delivery, which I discussed at our HIMSS Investor Meeting. Through continuous delivery, we expect to enable automatic deployment of updates and new innovations, which should significantly increase the rate of adoption, lower cost of ownership, and an improve or our speed to market. In summary, we believe these advancements will create significant value for our clients and drive tremendous productivity increases throughout Cerner. We also believe the ability to quickly deliver solutions at a lower cost will become more important as the financial pressures increase for our clients, and our ability to do this will become a competitive advantage. With that I\'ll turn the call to over questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Our first question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is now open. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. And thank you for the cash flow statement, I think it\'s a welcome addition. A question relative to cash, strong cash flow this quarter, cash building on the balance sheet, we didn\'t see you in the market, although we\'ve seen you in prior Q1s. Was there anything in the market that that precluded you from repurchasing shares, or is there any thought on timing of repurchase and/or other cash activity this year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, Eric, this is Marc. There wasn\'t anything the market precluding us from being in the market in the market, the timing – by the time we released Q1 and then we go into quite period for the end – when we released for the year, and then go to quiet period for Q1, it just made sense at this point that we stay on the sidelines. We still have $100 million of capacity available to us, and we would expect that to be increased appropriately as we go forward by the board. We certainly at a minimum expect to continue buybacks at a level to reduce any dilution or eliminate any dilution we get from issuing stock options, but there is nothing in the quarter other than just the timing of our quiet periods. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Very good. And one question on op expense, the level of reduction you saw this quarter, does that feel sustainable throughout the year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. I think – I mean, I think op expense is certainly consistent with the plan that we had. So I think our goal will be to continue to watch spending as we do, and continue to make sure that we are managing expenses. So I don\'t think – I think the future for us will be fairly consistent. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yeah, hi. Thank you, and congratulations for a really good quarter. If you can just give us a little bit more detail, I think in the prepared remarks you talked about 37% of bookings outside core. So when you think about gaining share, is this mostly from some of your customers that have acquired other hospitals, or is this just a new customer base? And also if you can talk a little bit in more detail about where you\'re seeing the demand on ITWorks, I think you said you expect it to tick up in the second quarter, so if you can just provide a little bit more details on that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. So thanks for the questions, and thanks for the congratulations. The net new additions of 37%, reflects, when we say outside of our core Millennium installed base, basically is a new client setting. And a lot of the – we saw a demand across all segments of our business, so I noted a large IDN, I noted a large public entity, I noted the two outside the U.S. on the significant side, but we saw that across the community hospital marketplace, across the small marketplace. So, there was a – and that\'s kind of been a trend that we\'ve seen for the last several quarters, has been a very active replacement market for our solutions, and we\'ve seen that in terms of that percentage. As it relates to the ITWorks opportunities, we are seeing more larger opportunities coming in the pipeline than we\'ve seen, historically speaking. So, there is a there\'s both a higher number of opportunities as well as larger opportunities moving forward. So we\'re seeing the success that we\'ve had in ITWorks from an execution perspective, now reflecting up, going up-market a bit in terms of the size of opportunity that we go after – we want to go after – that we\'re going after, and that there\'s a good acceptance for. And so as we look forward into the back half of the year, we see a number of opportunities, and they\'re of a bigger size than what we\'ve seen historically. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC So, should we think about the back half really as kind of an inflection point for ITWorks? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I think what we\'re saying is, it\'s kind of we think we have an opportunity to have a record high for ITWorks, which means not only returning to our 2015 highs that we saw, but the opportunity to eclipse our 2015 bookings amounts, which would be a significant bump from where we were in 2016. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Great, thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow up on Ricky\'s question. In terms of this – in the ITWorks opportunities, then you talked about going up-market to some bigger opportunities. What are clients using currently? Are they outsourcing to other, more traditional tech companies? Can you give us a sense for that competitive landscape looks there? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Most of these are in-house situations, so they\'re not typically outsourced, but they\'re looking – as I mentioned last year, there were not the same impetus in terms of the measures and mandates from a government perspective that were driving people to complete ITWorks business last year. We saw activity and we saw interest in what we were doing, but we were having a hard time moving things through the pipeline. What we\'re seeing as we move through the cycle for 2017 and beyond, is a focus on organizations looking at how can they make an impact with their own associates on their core business operations, which are truly about delivering medical care, and they\'re looking at things like the IT shop as the ways to enable that medical care, not part of their core business model. And so it\'s both the opportunity to move faster, it\'s also the execution success we\'ve had at our existing ITWorks clients in terms – and our ability to actually move faster and get better outcomes, as well as an unpredictable cost model in the future. We\'re able to bake in some of those kinds of assurances around what happens in your forward model. We\'ve done hosting for quite some time, so you think about hosting and application management, and some of the other Works businesses that we have, and we\'ve been doing that for a long time. ITWorks becomes an extension from which we\'re able to jump off of and take the rest of the client\'s business in a bigger and broader space. And we\'ve earned the confidence over time in those areas, and that\'s allowing us to have a different dialog. But I think the change from prior year to this year is we\'re seeing them – we\'re seeing the activity move forward, and you can see that they\'re getting closer in the close cycle. And I really think that\'s a reflection of people preparing for the future and some of these other measures and mandates beginning to pile up that they need help with. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC That\'s helpful. And if I could just follow up on a question on RevWorks. I know you guys talked a little bit about seeing increased demand on different types of RevCycle management, and you mentioned outsourcing – sort of full outsourcing. What is some of the demand interest in that part of the market? And sort of your receptivity, how much are you moving into that direction at this point? Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. We have a couple of full outsourced clients today. What we are seeing is similar to the ITWorks space; people are looking for how do I, again, create scale, use Cerner scale in a different way? How do I lock in some of the cost elements as I move forward? And how do I manage through some of the changing reimbursement sides of this? And so we\'re actually seeing the activity pick up on the full outsourcing as we look forward, as well. And so good activity through the pipeline is really building on the RevWorks side. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for the question. This is Adam Noble in for Bob. I just want to ask around population health, if you could give any updates around there on PMPM trends? And kind of the growth in risk-based lives in your platform? How have those trended? And thinking about the guidance, anything you could share around expectations for those for the course of the year? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Well, I don\'t think we are releasing the PMPM elements at this point. What I would say, obviously I noted double digit, I would say those were significant double digits. So we had great, for Q1, increase over our Q1 of 2016, and we\'re looking – for the year, we\'re looking at significant double digits for the year in terms of growth in that area. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got you. That makes a lot of sense. And thinking about the margins, I think Marc you mentioned on last quarter\'s call that you expected operating margins to be roughly flat year-over-year in 2017. Thinking about, what are kind of the main drivers from the 1Q baseline that you think will kind of push it back to that level, as we go through the year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Well, in Q1 we were basically flat year-over-year, and I think the biggest impact for us is the non-cash spend that we\'re going to incur in 2017, the $70 million or so uptick in that expense. So I think as projected, we expect operating margins to be relatively flat, and they were in Q1, we kind of expect that to continue this year. Obviously, we\'re pleased with the top-line growth, which allows us to grow earnings even with not realizing a lot of leverage in this year. That being said, we are not expecting us to have flat margins for the longer term. The business is designed to create leverage, and once we kind of get through some of the headwinds relative to some of the amortization of software that – we spent a lot of money on building new stuff, and as those come online, and the net (31:36) cap rate kind of declines, we should get to a point where we\'re back to looking at the 50 basis point to 100 basis point growth. I\'m not sure if we get to the top of that range in 2018, but certainly, as we start rolling forward, there is – the model has leverage in it, and we would expect to see margins grow, but in the near term, I think flat remains our expectation. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks for the questions. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen of Leerink. Your line is now open. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit about the VA and also the DoD, how are things progressing with the DoD, and any update on the VA\'s process? Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thanks, David. So, the – I\'ll start with the DoD dialog. Obviously, I mentioned in my prepared comments, we had the first go-live, it\'s gone extremely well. The DoD has been a fantastic client to work with, and we are on track for the remaining three pilots as we come through the summer, for the year, and that is the initial proof-of-concept element for the DoD. And our objective is, along with our partners, is to put our head down and deliver and have it continue to go very well, and we think that positions us well for other opportunities as they come about. As you are likely aware, the VA has issued an RFI for – to basically see what elements are out there in the commercial space, they have contracted with certain third parties to help do that review, and really make a determination as to whether they look at a commercially available off-the-shelf system, or COTS system, or stay with their Vista solution today. They could go back into – so, anything beyond that is speculation. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Okay, great. And then on the ambulatory side, who are you taking share from? Are you taking share, and how about like web-based vendors, such as Athena, I mean do you take share from them, just report (33:53) any thoughts around that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So we\'re taking share from all competitors, and we had another strong ambulatory quarter where we\'re taking share across all the competition. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks for taking my questions. Marc, quickly on the tech resale, you noted that you saw a strong tech resale quarter this year. Any particular areas you are seeing the strength in, and also do you see this becoming a tailwind in this year versus 2016, which I think was not such a great year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, no, I think for the first time, tech resale feels like it\'s going to meet or perhaps slightly exceed our expectations, and that certainly was some of the upside that we had in this quarter. It\'s really broadly both hardware and third-party software, which is the key components of the things that we resell. But both of those did well this quarter. Certainly from my perspective, nice to have tech resale. As we\'ve talked about in the past, talked about continuing to kind of reduce our expectations of what we thought tech resale was going to do, and the ability this quarter for them to come in at a number above what we were expecting, hasn\'t happened for a while. So we\'re definitely, we\'re excited about that. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Got it. Maybe quickly on the bookings. So this quarter, without an ITWorks deal, you guys were pretty strong in bookings growth. I hear you guys talking about the strength in ITWorks pipeline and confidence in closing them. Do you need some of these deals to close to get a bookings growth for the full year? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I mean, when we do our forecasting and for the annual, we obviously take into account all the transactions that are out there. For the most part, ITWorks, based on the difficulty in exactly forecasting the timing, are fairly risk-weighted down. So I don\'t know that I would absolutely say we\'ve got to go deliver a bunch of ITWorks deals in order to get growth. Clearly, this quarter we delivered growth, with really not a lot of help from ITWorks. Q2, we\'re also not expecting a whole lot of help from ITWorks, with most of it coming kind of in the second half. So, I think that – as we go forward, I think that we certainly have some nice pipeline, we certainly expect that to contribute, but I think it\'s not dependent on delivering a bunch of ITWorks deals. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. That\'s great. Congrats on a great start to the year. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of UBS. Your line is now open. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Afternoon, guys. I want to echo the congratulations on a nice start to the year. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Thinking more about the competitive dynamic in hospital, you had really strong performance outside your core base. As you think about the discussions being had, I know you talked about DC, but relative to what hospitals are going through and the uncertainty of ACA, relative to also just general financial pressures, how do the discussions change when you go into those large rip-and-replaces about ROI? What ROI are you able to show these customers that can prove that they can take whatever, their tens, hundreds of millions of dollars that now looks like it\'s wasted, and move your way? I\'m just trying to see how the discussion shifts in an environment where they don\'t have funding backing them up, and it\'s all based primarily on value proposition, if they ask for anything else from you? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Great question. So it\'s interesting. Each client has its own unique element, so there\'s not a total way – simple way to overly generalize, but I\'ll give you two examples. One we highlighted was the client that added the 10 additional sites, so they had Cerner in a reasonably sized chunk of their business, and they were looking to add to the portfolio. And what they\'re doing there, the justification is actually, we can consolidate our business for them, they can consolidate on a single platform, and there is more things to do, but they\'re actually seeing a hard ROI around the Cerner solution set and the capabilities that we have. And so we have implemented a number of value creation, either offices or opportunities with our clients, and almost every new business opportunity has an ROI analysis around it, and that\'s part of our charter that we work together with the clients around that ROI. And really what clients are trying to do, in the case that I mentioned of the 10 space, that\'s one where they\'re trying to standardize their operations and reduce costs overall. At the same time, they have revenue enhancements from the software that we provide, so it\'s a double positive for them. In a core, if you just think about a standalone organization, it\'s really – they\'re trying to do twofold. They\'re trying to prepare for the future, so they need a solid foundational system that will allow them to be flexible as they move forward, and give them as much comfort about the systems they\'re on, because as I mentioned previously, over half of the systems out there are not on a currently marketed solution. And so you have a lot of legacy cleanup that needs to occur. In addition to that, the ROI that we\'re able to provide, based on the Cerner solutions and it\'s unique to what we do, it helps those business cases move forward. So it\'s kind of – the conversation is really about the foundational elements as you move forward, as well as our – the ability to pay for it along the way. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Great. I\'ll let – I\'ll jump back in the queue. Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Good afternoon, guys, and again, congrats on a nice start to the year. Maybe specifically more on RevWorks, but you made some favorable comments in the prepared remarks Zane, but you guys have been very confident on the ITWorks portion of the business. So could you remind us what the assumptions were for RevWorks deals for this year, and just a little bit more detail as to what it needs to pick RevWorks up in the back half of the year as well? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, this is Marc. RevWorks being the all-encompassing all-outsourcing element, we haven\'t really made any overly strong expectations of that for 2017. What we\'re seeing some good strength in is our back office – our business office services, our back office, all of the incremental services that we provide for the revenue function that isn\'t full outsourcing. There is a lot of interest in that, that business is actually doing very well. So, in that environment, we\'re not – we\'re certainly working with clients as they work their way into deciding whether they want to fully outsource on the Revenue Cycle. But I think certainly the interim services that we\'re doing is a little bit like the hosting business for an ITWorks client, it gets them some familiarity with how we do things, some comfort level in our skill sets. And I think that\'s what we\'re focusing on for the most part on the Revenue Cycle. Once again, working with one of our premier clients, is of significant size and delivering a great experience and an example through them that we can then take to the industry. But I think certainly as we look our bookings opportunities, ITWorks and the number and size of opportunities is a much closer opportunity to us than RevWorks. Zane? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. One element that we have seen, which is why I referenced it in the prepared comments, is the pipeline for full outsourcing is something that we are seeing. We are seeing an activity and interest in the pipeline. And so I would look at that as, not necessarily a significant element to contribute to 2017, but as we move beyond that time period and into the – over the long term, I think it provides some really great long-term opportunities. Some things that we\'ve done on an individual basis is, every new business opportunity that sells Revenue Cycle today has some proportion of a revenues – of a RevWorks services offering. So we get people started on our offerings. And I think that\'s proving to be a really great model for creation of businesses in the future, and we\'re seeing some of that play through in the pipeline. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Got it. So, but for 2017, it\'s meeting your modest expectations to date, three quarters in? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, it\'s doing well on the business office services level, and we don\'t have any big expectations for the bigger deals. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Got it. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I would say it\'s an upside opportunity for us as we move forward. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay, that\'s very helpful. And then a quick follow-up was, at Investor Day I thought that there was some commentary on selecting a CRM partner to fulfill I think it was a variety of front-end activities and some patient outreach, I think, so could you elaborate on where you are in that process? And I guess more importantly, what will that allow you to do, or do better, and where would we see the impact of that partnership in the financials? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So this is Zane. I think there\'s nothing really to discuss at this point in time, and so when there is we\'ll let ... Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Fair enough. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. ... people know on that side, and I think your question will – we can address more appropriately when we get to that point. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Fair enough. Thanks again. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thanks very much. Just a quick question, I\'m not sure Marc if you have a way to sort of encapsulate this. But I\'m just thinking about the bookings revenue, and – versus – and really more on the software side. I\'m thinking about the mix between recurring software and one-time software. Is that coming in fairly consistently? I can\'t remember off the top of my head what you talked about in terms of that at the Investor Day in 2016, but just how to think about sort of, are we continuing to see the shift, and how dramatic is the shift going towards recurring software versus the one-time software? Any commentary or color around that would be really appreciated. Thanks. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Well, I think we talked about, of our licensed software, about 30% of it is SaaS. So I think that\'s a data point relative to the licensed software. I\'d also point out that it\'s not really a shift. We continue to sell one-time software, continue to sell licenses, that\'s actually – that\'s the bulk of our business, doing that. But what we are seeing is that the additive elements of our business, the IT that we are selling as a service or on a subscription basis, is continuing to ramp up. That number as the revenue number continues to be strong, and the percent of that from – that\'s recurring in nature, we expect that to continue to ramp up as well. So, I think that\'s, for us broadly you\'ve got the – Millennium\'s a license, HealtheIntent is primarily the SaaS-based, along with some of the Cerner Works and the ambulatory cloud solutions that we offer. But key for us is, it\'s great business, but it isn\'t – we\'re not shifting models, it\'s additive to our business. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. That\'s really helpful. So, just to sort of summarize that you\'re growing that, but you\'re not – there\'s not a focus on transitioning it, and you\'re not thinking of each year growing the SaaS and shrinking the other personally (46:34), it\'s just how things shake out, and right now it looks to be fairly consistent because you\'re doing well on the one-time software side? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Correct. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi, yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a couple of quick ones for Zane, as a follow-up to I think Ricky\'s questions earlier. Could you just give us a ballpark for the number of facilities that are not on Millennium, that your existing clients currently own today? I think in the past you\'ve thrown out a number around 300, is it still around there? And then the second one, international, yeah FX was a headwind during the quarter, it sounds like maybe tech resale was weak there, but can you just kind of paint a picture for us of what you think that international business is going to do over the next two or three years? Can we see it reaccelerate, maybe a mid-teens growth rate, because it seems like it\'s still a relatively small piece of your business? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Right. First, I\'ll start with – Jamie, I\'ll start with the first piece. The number of actually opportunities has actually grown, because we continue to add more clients, and so we have more clients as part – so even though we\'ve taken elements out, like the 10 sites this quarter, we continue to add additional clients, and we\'ve added more clients in the last eight quarters than any time in history of the company. And so you look at a couple of – we have some really significant opportunities with many of our largest clients in that side, and that\'s – and they\'ve been nothing, but net acquirers, also, over this time. So when we talked about the 300, I would just tell you, it\'s in excess of that number at this point in time, and has actually continued to grow as an opportunity size for us. On the international business, we believe that that business will grow, that as there\'s been a slow economic recovery, and we\'re encouraged actually by the bookings results, it hasn\'t necessarily shown up on the income statement yet to date. And so I think there\'s a good opportunity, I\'ve spent a fair amount of my time in the global market outside the U.S., and I think it\'s a – it represents a growth opportunity for us over the mid-range and long-range term. And I think you\'re going to – the front, early indicator of that is both obviously, the pipeline is very strong, and so our global pipeline is at an all-time high, our bookings were very solid for the quarter from global, it just didn\'t translate to the income statement at this point. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. That\'s great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland of Piper Jaffray. Your line is still open. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hi, thanks, and so just to follow up on Jamie\'s question, I don\'t think I heard the answer that – can you quantify the opportunity that you\'ve got, of health system customers that still have a significant number of sites on legacy systems? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. We don\'t... Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. ... is there are a dollar value, you can assign to that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, Sean, we\'re not going to assign a dollar value for it. I mean, it\'s a variety of sizes of places, there\'s a variety of things that go into it, but the fact that an existing client that already has our footprint, and we have that number of facilities to which we have the opportunity to extend, it\'s part of our normal business. It\'s not – we don\'t see that as upside to the business, that\'s part of our normal approach and a normal view of the world as we look and do our forecasting, but we can\'t really give you a dollar number as to what that means. Sorry. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. No problem. How about – on ITWorks? So what I\'m hearing is that it seems like the dry spell is coming to an end, maybe not by the second quarter, but certainly into the second half. But what I haven\'t heard is some specific factors, either internal to Cerner or external in the market, that\'s going to cause this, what appears to be healthy pipeline of ITWorks deals, convert into – or prospects convert into deals? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah. So, I may not have eloquently said it, but what I would tell you is that the factors that are changing is the – a little bit of the unsettledness around what happens in the future actually helps us in this space, as well as some of the government regulations that were on pause for 2016, which come into play in 2017. There\'s a number of factors that really impact what I think was a kind of a pause for 2016. So I think really the factors that were there previously that had fueled good growth in the ITWorks business, I think is really more of a return to the pre-2016 era of, you have measures and mandates from government. You\'ve got increased concern over costs. You have increased focus on: I need – I should focus my associates on things that matter. So as a health system, I\'m going to focus my people on the pieces that really matter, which is providing care, and thinking about how I make money in a future of healthcare in that environment. I really think 2016 was a bit of a pause, because margins were actually pretty good across our client base. There was no measures and mandates, no meaningful use element in 2016. And so, you just didn\'t have those same factors, that we\'re kind of back to where we were in 2015 from that perspective. So I really look at it and say, 2017 is more of the normal, where we thought we would be; what we missed was 2016 being a pause. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. All right. That\'s helpful. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the revenue performance. It seems like licensed software was the other key driver relative to expectations. Just curious if there was any additional commentary you could provide, were there any particularly large deals that came through, or was it more broad-based? And then also from a product mix standpoint on licensed software, was there more contribution from the RevCycle software or more on the EHR? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. This is Zane. So, I think it\'s broad-based elements. We didn\'t have any single transaction that drove licensed software in a significant way, it was actually the volume of transactions; the amount of new business wins were significant. Revenue Cycle was significant in all of those elements, both from an installed base as well as our new business opportunity. But I\'ll actually say, we got a little bit of bump on our new business side from a licensed software perspective. And having some of those larger opportunities, and winning at those larger opportunities, you tend to have a little bit bigger software pieces. So the ones that I mentioned were more significant, but I think that\'s reflective of what we see in the marketplace. But there was not any single transaction that made a big difference there. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. And, it\'s still broad-based, still significant sales back into the base. But really no one solution or no specific groups of solutions were notably bigger than the others. Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Got it. Thanks for taking the question. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Garro of William Blair & Company. Your line is now open. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Good afternoon, guys and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on Mike\'s discussion on Cerner Advance and continuous availability. If I\'m interpreting that correctly, it seems tied to cloud capabilities and remote hosting. So maybe you could update us on the overall penetration of hosting services, and how we should think about whether clients are adopting hosting so that they can take advantage of these additional capabilities, or if they are adopting hosting on a standalone value proposition, and then discovering everything else that they can do to their benefit? Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. So this is Mike. Actually, they are related topics, but there are some distinctions between the two as well. Cerner Advance was really developed to allow us to capture data at a very granular level about the use of our system, and then through our analytics, we can then drive back, in across the entire client base, recommendations for improving the use and effectiveness of our solutions. Now if you tie that to – and that advantage can be realized whether you\'re hosting – whether we\'re hosting the system for them or not. But if we look at our hosting capabilities today, probably 75% to 80% of our clients run out of our data center, and all new deals are within that model. And you are correct that we do have an advantage when we run those systems, we have the ability to keep our clients current, refresh their software more easily with less effort, and allow them to drive the value more quickly. So it doesn\'t necessarily have to be cloud-based, it\'s just a fact that now by operating within our environment we can do things that maybe wouldn\'t be – they couldn\'t do on their own. So it is a huge advantage that we leverage significantly. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Great, and if I can squeeze one in for Marc, wanted to ask if there\'s any update to metrics you\'ve given before on revenue visibility, like the percentage growth needed from bookings for the year or amount of revenue for the remainder of the year coming from backlog that enhances your visibility on the forward outlook? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Usually that\'s a – those are data points, Jeff, that we provide at the beginning of the year to kind of give you a sense when we\'re providing an annual guidance, we don\'t update those throughout the year. Obviously when you get – go from a 12-month view to a 90-day view, your visibility is a higher percent than we would have talked about coming from backlog earlier, but we don\'t – we do not update those during the year. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC No problem. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. Why don\'t we take one more question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Great, good afternoon. I was curious when you talk about large ITWorks in the pipeline, if you could help kind of size what that means, and in terms of – this might be a tough question to answer, because I know it will range widely, but what is the typical run rate – revenue run rate of a "large" ITWorks contract? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. This is Marc. It\'s really hard to give you an average, because we have 25 clients now, and they even range within their universe, and that is probably 25 clients that are kind of at the lower end. I mean, if you were looking kind of what our current clients in that – in our current range is, it\'s probably $20 million a year, which includes not only their ITWorks components, but all the revenue that\'s coming from that client, which would be licensed software, support, all the elements, because we combine all those. Once an ITWorks deal is done, the ITWorks team owns that client regardless where the revenue is coming from. So, that gives you – kind of gives you a sense of what\'s in the current base. As we look forward, you have some that are that size, you have some that could be five times that size. So the opportunity, when we talk about bigger ones, we\'re talking about multiple – opportunities that could be multiples bigger from an annual revenue standpoint, when you do this all-inclusive view. So that\'s – for us that\'s kind of the next step, once we\'ve gotten the standalone or smaller clients, trying to move it upscale. And as Zane said, the current environment of people focusing on cost is making them consider doing an outsourcing, where they might not have before. Once again, why the industry really doesn\'t have a history of outsourcing. We\'re not going in to compete against an existing outsourcer. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. And when you win these deals, it takes time for that revenue to kick in, I understand. How late this year is a sort of a cut-off for deals sort of impacting 2018, as we start thinking about ITWorks possibly rebounding in 2018? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, this is Zane. I\'d say there is – there are implications in the current quarter of signing, so you do see positive earnings and revenue from ITWorks in the quarter they sign. Obviously it depends on what point in the quarter that has does happen. But it\'s more of a run rate that\'s begun once that opportunity is completed. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. Usually these deals you sign and rebadge simultaneously, because it\'s all part of a ... Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Okay. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. ... communication process. So really the month you sign it, is the first month of that sequential revenue comes. So, you can – if you sign stuff in Q2 and Q3, it will have a fairly full Q impact beginning in the next quarter. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Right. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. That\'s helpful. Thank you. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I want to thank everyone for being on the call today. I appreciate it. I know you guys have got lots to do. So, I\'ll let you go. Have a good day. Bye. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference. That does conclude today\'s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Operator Our first question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is now open. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. And thank you for the cash flow statement, I think it\'s a welcome addition. A question relative to cash, strong cash flow this quarter, cash building on the balance sheet, we didn\'t see you in the market, although we\'ve seen you in prior Q1s. Was there anything in the market that that precluded you from repurchasing shares, or is there any thought on timing of repurchase and/or other cash activity this year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, Eric, this is Marc. There wasn\'t anything the market precluding us from being in the market in the market, the timing – by the time we released Q1 and then we go into quite period for the end – when we released for the year, and then go to quiet period for Q1, it just made sense at this point that we stay on the sidelines. We still have $100 million of capacity available to us, and we would expect that to be increased appropriately as we go forward by the board. We certainly at a minimum expect to continue buybacks at a level to reduce any dilution or eliminate any dilution we get from issuing stock options, but there is nothing in the quarter other than just the timing of our quiet periods. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Very good. And one question on op expense, the level of reduction you saw this quarter, does that feel sustainable throughout the year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. I think – I mean, I think op expense is certainly consistent with the plan that we had. So I think our goal will be to continue to watch spending as we do, and continue to make sure that we are managing expenses. So I don\'t think – I think the future for us will be fairly consistent. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yeah, hi. Thank you, and congratulations for a really good quarter. If you can just give us a little bit more detail, I think in the prepared remarks you talked about 37% of bookings outside core. So when you think about gaining share, is this mostly from some of your customers that have acquired other hospitals, or is this just a new customer base? And also if you can talk a little bit in more detail about where you\'re seeing the demand on ITWorks, I think you said you expect it to tick up in the second quarter, so if you can just provide a little bit more details on that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. So thanks for the questions, and thanks for the congratulations. The net new additions of 37%, reflects, when we say outside of our core Millennium installed base, basically is a new client setting. And a lot of the – we saw a demand across all segments of our business, so I noted a large IDN, I noted a large public entity, I noted the two outside the U.S. on the significant side, but we saw that across the community hospital marketplace, across the small marketplace. So, there was a – and that\'s kind of been a trend that we\'ve seen for the last several quarters, has been a very active replacement market for our solutions, and we\'ve seen that in terms of that percentage. As it relates to the ITWorks opportunities, we are seeing more larger opportunities coming in the pipeline than we\'ve seen, historically speaking. So, there is a there\'s both a higher number of opportunities as well as larger opportunities moving forward. So we\'re seeing the success that we\'ve had in ITWorks from an execution perspective, now reflecting up, going up-market a bit in terms of the size of opportunity that we go after – we want to go after – that we\'re going after, and that there\'s a good acceptance for. And so as we look forward into the back half of the year, we see a number of opportunities, and they\'re of a bigger size than what we\'ve seen historically. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC So, should we think about the back half really as kind of an inflection point for ITWorks? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I think what we\'re saying is, it\'s kind of we think we have an opportunity to have a record high for ITWorks, which means not only returning to our 2015 highs that we saw, but the opportunity to eclipse our 2015 bookings amounts, which would be a significant bump from where we were in 2016. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Great, thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow up on Ricky\'s question. In terms of this – in the ITWorks opportunities, then you talked about going up-market to some bigger opportunities. What are clients using currently? Are they outsourcing to other, more traditional tech companies? Can you give us a sense for that competitive landscape looks there? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Most of these are in-house situations, so they\'re not typically outsourced, but they\'re looking – as I mentioned last year, there were not the same impetus in terms of the measures and mandates from a government perspective that were driving people to complete ITWorks business last year. We saw activity and we saw interest in what we were doing, but we were having a hard time moving things through the pipeline. What we\'re seeing as we move through the cycle for 2017 and beyond, is a focus on organizations looking at how can they make an impact with their own associates on their core business operations, which are truly about delivering medical care, and they\'re looking at things like the IT shop as the ways to enable that medical care, not part of their core business model. And so it\'s both the opportunity to move faster, it\'s also the execution success we\'ve had at our existing ITWorks clients in terms – and our ability to actually move faster and get better outcomes, as well as an unpredictable cost model in the future. We\'re able to bake in some of those kinds of assurances around what happens in your forward model. We\'ve done hosting for quite some time, so you think about hosting and application management, and some of the other Works businesses that we have, and we\'ve been doing that for a long time. ITWorks becomes an extension from which we\'re able to jump off of and take the rest of the client\'s business in a bigger and broader space. And we\'ve earned the confidence over time in those areas, and that\'s allowing us to have a different dialog. But I think the change from prior year to this year is we\'re seeing them – we\'re seeing the activity move forward, and you can see that they\'re getting closer in the close cycle. And I really think that\'s a reflection of people preparing for the future and some of these other measures and mandates beginning to pile up that they need help with. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC That\'s helpful. And if I could just follow up on a question on RevWorks. I know you guys talked a little bit about seeing increased demand on different types of RevCycle management, and you mentioned outsourcing – sort of full outsourcing. What is some of the demand interest in that part of the market? And sort of your receptivity, how much are you moving into that direction at this point? Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. We have a couple of full outsourced clients today. What we are seeing is similar to the ITWorks space; people are looking for how do I, again, create scale, use Cerner scale in a different way? How do I lock in some of the cost elements as I move forward? And how do I manage through some of the changing reimbursement sides of this? And so we\'re actually seeing the activity pick up on the full outsourcing as we look forward, as well. And so good activity through the pipeline is really building on the RevWorks side. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for the question. This is Adam Noble in for Bob. I just want to ask around population health, if you could give any updates around there on PMPM trends? And kind of the growth in risk-based lives in your platform? How have those trended? And thinking about the guidance, anything you could share around expectations for those for the course of the year? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Well, I don\'t think we are releasing the PMPM elements at this point. What I would say, obviously I noted double digit, I would say those were significant double digits. So we had great, for Q1, increase over our Q1 of 2016, and we\'re looking – for the year, we\'re looking at significant double digits for the year in terms of growth in that area. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got you. That makes a lot of sense. And thinking about the margins, I think Marc you mentioned on last quarter\'s call that you expected operating margins to be roughly flat year-over-year in 2017. Thinking about, what are kind of the main drivers from the 1Q baseline that you think will kind of push it back to that level, as we go through the year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Well, in Q1 we were basically flat year-over-year, and I think the biggest impact for us is the non-cash spend that we\'re going to incur in 2017, the $70 million or so uptick in that expense. So I think as projected, we expect operating margins to be relatively flat, and they were in Q1, we kind of expect that to continue this year. Obviously, we\'re pleased with the top-line growth, which allows us to grow earnings even with not realizing a lot of leverage in this year. That being said, we are not expecting us to have flat margins for the longer term. The business is designed to create leverage, and once we kind of get through some of the headwinds relative to some of the amortization of software that – we spent a lot of money on building new stuff, and as those come online, and the net (31:36) cap rate kind of declines, we should get to a point where we\'re back to looking at the 50 basis point to 100 basis point growth. I\'m not sure if we get to the top of that range in 2018, but certainly, as we start rolling forward, there is – the model has leverage in it, and we would expect to see margins grow, but in the near term, I think flat remains our expectation. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks for the questions. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen of Leerink. Your line is now open. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit about the VA and also the DoD, how are things progressing with the DoD, and any update on the VA\'s process? Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thanks, David. So, the – I\'ll start with the DoD dialog. Obviously, I mentioned in my prepared comments, we had the first go-live, it\'s gone extremely well. The DoD has been a fantastic client to work with, and we are on track for the remaining three pilots as we come through the summer, for the year, and that is the initial proof-of-concept element for the DoD. And our objective is, along with our partners, is to put our head down and deliver and have it continue to go very well, and we think that positions us well for other opportunities as they come about. As you are likely aware, the VA has issued an RFI for – to basically see what elements are out there in the commercial space, they have contracted with certain third parties to help do that review, and really make a determination as to whether they look at a commercially available off-the-shelf system, or COTS system, or stay with their Vista solution today. They could go back into – so, anything beyond that is speculation. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Okay, great. And then on the ambulatory side, who are you taking share from? Are you taking share, and how about like web-based vendors, such as Athena, I mean do you take share from them, just report (33:53) any thoughts around that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So we\'re taking share from all competitors, and we had another strong ambulatory quarter where we\'re taking share across all the competition. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks for taking my questions. Marc, quickly on the tech resale, you noted that you saw a strong tech resale quarter this year. Any particular areas you are seeing the strength in, and also do you see this becoming a tailwind in this year versus 2016, which I think was not such a great year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, no, I think for the first time, tech resale feels like it\'s going to meet or perhaps slightly exceed our expectations, and that certainly was some of the upside that we had in this quarter. It\'s really broadly both hardware and third-party software, which is the key components of the things that we resell. But both of those did well this quarter. Certainly from my perspective, nice to have tech resale. As we\'ve talked about in the past, talked about continuing to kind of reduce our expectations of what we thought tech resale was going to do, and the ability this quarter for them to come in at a number above what we were expecting, hasn\'t happened for a while. So we\'re definitely, we\'re excited about that. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Got it. Maybe quickly on the bookings. So this quarter, without an ITWorks deal, you guys were pretty strong in bookings growth. I hear you guys talking about the strength in ITWorks pipeline and confidence in closing them. Do you need some of these deals to close to get a bookings growth for the full year? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I mean, when we do our forecasting and for the annual, we obviously take into account all the transactions that are out there. For the most part, ITWorks, based on the difficulty in exactly forecasting the timing, are fairly risk-weighted down. So I don\'t know that I would absolutely say we\'ve got to go deliver a bunch of ITWorks deals in order to get growth. Clearly, this quarter we delivered growth, with really not a lot of help from ITWorks. Q2, we\'re also not expecting a whole lot of help from ITWorks, with most of it coming kind of in the second half. So, I think that – as we go forward, I think that we certainly have some nice pipeline, we certainly expect that to contribute, but I think it\'s not dependent on delivering a bunch of ITWorks deals. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. That\'s great. Congrats on a great start to the year. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of UBS. Your line is now open. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Afternoon, guys. I want to echo the congratulations on a nice start to the year. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Thinking more about the competitive dynamic in hospital, you had really strong performance outside your core base. As you think about the discussions being had, I know you talked about DC, but relative to what hospitals are going through and the uncertainty of ACA, relative to also just general financial pressures, how do the discussions change when you go into those large rip-and-replaces about ROI? What ROI are you able to show these customers that can prove that they can take whatever, their tens, hundreds of millions of dollars that now looks like it\'s wasted, and move your way? I\'m just trying to see how the discussion shifts in an environment where they don\'t have funding backing them up, and it\'s all based primarily on value proposition, if they ask for anything else from you? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Great question. So it\'s interesting. Each client has its own unique element, so there\'s not a total way – simple way to overly generalize, but I\'ll give you two examples. One we highlighted was the client that added the 10 additional sites, so they had Cerner in a reasonably sized chunk of their business, and they were looking to add to the portfolio. And what they\'re doing there, the justification is actually, we can consolidate our business for them, they can consolidate on a single platform, and there is more things to do, but they\'re actually seeing a hard ROI around the Cerner solution set and the capabilities that we have. And so we have implemented a number of value creation, either offices or opportunities with our clients, and almost every new business opportunity has an ROI analysis around it, and that\'s part of our charter that we work together with the clients around that ROI. And really what clients are trying to do, in the case that I mentioned of the 10 space, that\'s one where they\'re trying to standardize their operations and reduce costs overall. At the same time, they have revenue enhancements from the software that we provide, so it\'s a double positive for them. In a core, if you just think about a standalone organization, it\'s really – they\'re trying to do twofold. They\'re trying to prepare for the future, so they need a solid foundational system that will allow them to be flexible as they move forward, and give them as much comfort about the systems they\'re on, because as I mentioned previously, over half of the systems out there are not on a currently marketed solution. And so you have a lot of legacy cleanup that needs to occur. In addition to that, the ROI that we\'re able to provide, based on the Cerner solutions and it\'s unique to what we do, it helps those business cases move forward. So it\'s kind of – the conversation is really about the foundational elements as you move forward, as well as our – the ability to pay for it along the way. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Great. I\'ll let – I\'ll jump back in the queue. Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Good afternoon, guys, and again, congrats on a nice start to the year. Maybe specifically more on RevWorks, but you made some favorable comments in the prepared remarks Zane, but you guys have been very confident on the ITWorks portion of the business. So could you remind us what the assumptions were for RevWorks deals for this year, and just a little bit more detail as to what it needs to pick RevWorks up in the back half of the year as well? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, this is Marc. RevWorks being the all-encompassing all-outsourcing element, we haven\'t really made any overly strong expectations of that for 2017. What we\'re seeing some good strength in is our back office – our business office services, our back office, all of the incremental services that we provide for the revenue function that isn\'t full outsourcing. There is a lot of interest in that, that business is actually doing very well. So, in that environment, we\'re not – we\'re certainly working with clients as they work their way into deciding whether they want to fully outsource on the Revenue Cycle. But I think certainly the interim services that we\'re doing is a little bit like the hosting business for an ITWorks client, it gets them some familiarity with how we do things, some comfort level in our skill sets. And I think that\'s what we\'re focusing on for the most part on the Revenue Cycle. Once again, working with one of our premier clients, is of significant size and delivering a great experience and an example through them that we can then take to the industry. But I think certainly as we look our bookings opportunities, ITWorks and the number and size of opportunities is a much closer opportunity to us than RevWorks. Zane? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. One element that we have seen, which is why I referenced it in the prepared comments, is the pipeline for full outsourcing is something that we are seeing. We are seeing an activity and interest in the pipeline. And so I would look at that as, not necessarily a significant element to contribute to 2017, but as we move beyond that time period and into the – over the long term, I think it provides some really great long-term opportunities. Some things that we\'ve done on an individual basis is, every new business opportunity that sells Revenue Cycle today has some proportion of a revenues – of a RevWorks services offering. So we get people started on our offerings. And I think that\'s proving to be a really great model for creation of businesses in the future, and we\'re seeing some of that play through in the pipeline. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Got it. So, but for 2017, it\'s meeting your modest expectations to date, three quarters in? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, it\'s doing well on the business office services level, and we don\'t have any big expectations for the bigger deals. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Got it. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I would say it\'s an upside opportunity for us as we move forward. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay, that\'s very helpful. And then a quick follow-up was, at Investor Day I thought that there was some commentary on selecting a CRM partner to fulfill I think it was a variety of front-end activities and some patient outreach, I think, so could you elaborate on where you are in that process? And I guess more importantly, what will that allow you to do, or do better, and where would we see the impact of that partnership in the financials? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So this is Zane. I think there\'s nothing really to discuss at this point in time, and so when there is we\'ll let ... Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Fair enough. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. ... people know on that side, and I think your question will – we can address more appropriately when we get to that point. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Fair enough. Thanks again. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thanks very much. Just a quick question, I\'m not sure Marc if you have a way to sort of encapsulate this. But I\'m just thinking about the bookings revenue, and – versus – and really more on the software side. I\'m thinking about the mix between recurring software and one-time software. Is that coming in fairly consistently? I can\'t remember off the top of my head what you talked about in terms of that at the Investor Day in 2016, but just how to think about sort of, are we continuing to see the shift, and how dramatic is the shift going towards recurring software versus the one-time software? Any commentary or color around that would be really appreciated. Thanks. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Well, I think we talked about, of our licensed software, about 30% of it is SaaS. So I think that\'s a data point relative to the licensed software. I\'d also point out that it\'s not really a shift. We continue to sell one-time software, continue to sell licenses, that\'s actually – that\'s the bulk of our business, doing that. But what we are seeing is that the additive elements of our business, the IT that we are selling as a service or on a subscription basis, is continuing to ramp up. That number as the revenue number continues to be strong, and the percent of that from – that\'s recurring in nature, we expect that to continue to ramp up as well. So, I think that\'s, for us broadly you\'ve got the – Millennium\'s a license, HealtheIntent is primarily the SaaS-based, along with some of the Cerner Works and the ambulatory cloud solutions that we offer. But key for us is, it\'s great business, but it isn\'t – we\'re not shifting models, it\'s additive to our business. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. That\'s really helpful. So, just to sort of summarize that you\'re growing that, but you\'re not – there\'s not a focus on transitioning it, and you\'re not thinking of each year growing the SaaS and shrinking the other personally (46:34), it\'s just how things shake out, and right now it looks to be fairly consistent because you\'re doing well on the one-time software side? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Correct. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi, yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a couple of quick ones for Zane, as a follow-up to I think Ricky\'s questions earlier. Could you just give us a ballpark for the number of facilities that are not on Millennium, that your existing clients currently own today? I think in the past you\'ve thrown out a number around 300, is it still around there? And then the second one, international, yeah FX was a headwind during the quarter, it sounds like maybe tech resale was weak there, but can you just kind of paint a picture for us of what you think that international business is going to do over the next two or three years? Can we see it reaccelerate, maybe a mid-teens growth rate, because it seems like it\'s still a relatively small piece of your business? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Right. First, I\'ll start with – Jamie, I\'ll start with the first piece. The number of actually opportunities has actually grown, because we continue to add more clients, and so we have more clients as part – so even though we\'ve taken elements out, like the 10 sites this quarter, we continue to add additional clients, and we\'ve added more clients in the last eight quarters than any time in history of the company. And so you look at a couple of – we have some really significant opportunities with many of our largest clients in that side, and that\'s – and they\'ve been nothing, but net acquirers, also, over this time. So when we talked about the 300, I would just tell you, it\'s in excess of that number at this point in time, and has actually continued to grow as an opportunity size for us. On the international business, we believe that that business will grow, that as there\'s been a slow economic recovery, and we\'re encouraged actually by the bookings results, it hasn\'t necessarily shown up on the income statement yet to date. And so I think there\'s a good opportunity, I\'ve spent a fair amount of my time in the global market outside the U.S., and I think it\'s a – it represents a growth opportunity for us over the mid-range and long-range term. And I think you\'re going to – the front, early indicator of that is both obviously, the pipeline is very strong, and so our global pipeline is at an all-time high, our bookings were very solid for the quarter from global, it just didn\'t translate to the income statement at this point. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. That\'s great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland of Piper Jaffray. Your line is still open. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hi, thanks, and so just to follow up on Jamie\'s question, I don\'t think I heard the answer that – can you quantify the opportunity that you\'ve got, of health system customers that still have a significant number of sites on legacy systems? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. We don\'t... Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. ... is there are a dollar value, you can assign to that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, Sean, we\'re not going to assign a dollar value for it. I mean, it\'s a variety of sizes of places, there\'s a variety of things that go into it, but the fact that an existing client that already has our footprint, and we have that number of facilities to which we have the opportunity to extend, it\'s part of our normal business. It\'s not – we don\'t see that as upside to the business, that\'s part of our normal approach and a normal view of the world as we look and do our forecasting, but we can\'t really give you a dollar number as to what that means. Sorry. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. No problem. How about – on ITWorks? So what I\'m hearing is that it seems like the dry spell is coming to an end, maybe not by the second quarter, but certainly into the second half. But what I haven\'t heard is some specific factors, either internal to Cerner or external in the market, that\'s going to cause this, what appears to be healthy pipeline of ITWorks deals, convert into – or prospects convert into deals? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah. So, I may not have eloquently said it, but what I would tell you is that the factors that are changing is the – a little bit of the unsettledness around what happens in the future actually helps us in this space, as well as some of the government regulations that were on pause for 2016, which come into play in 2017. There\'s a number of factors that really impact what I think was a kind of a pause for 2016. So I think really the factors that were there previously that had fueled good growth in the ITWorks business, I think is really more of a return to the pre-2016 era of, you have measures and mandates from government. You\'ve got increased concern over costs. You have increased focus on: I need – I should focus my associates on things that matter. So as a health system, I\'m going to focus my people on the pieces that really matter, which is providing care, and thinking about how I make money in a future of healthcare in that environment. I really think 2016 was a bit of a pause, because margins were actually pretty good across our client base. There was no measures and mandates, no meaningful use element in 2016. And so, you just didn\'t have those same factors, that we\'re kind of back to where we were in 2015 from that perspective. So I really look at it and say, 2017 is more of the normal, where we thought we would be; what we missed was 2016 being a pause. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. All right. That\'s helpful. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the revenue performance. It seems like licensed software was the other key driver relative to expectations. Just curious if there was any additional commentary you could provide, were there any particularly large deals that came through, or was it more broad-based? And then also from a product mix standpoint on licensed software, was there more contribution from the RevCycle software or more on the EHR? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. This is Zane. So, I think it\'s broad-based elements. We didn\'t have any single transaction that drove licensed software in a significant way, it was actually the volume of transactions; the amount of new business wins were significant. Revenue Cycle was significant in all of those elements, both from an installed base as well as our new business opportunity. But I\'ll actually say, we got a little bit of bump on our new business side from a licensed software perspective. And having some of those larger opportunities, and winning at those larger opportunities, you tend to have a little bit bigger software pieces. So the ones that I mentioned were more significant, but I think that\'s reflective of what we see in the marketplace. But there was not any single transaction that made a big difference there. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. And, it\'s still broad-based, still significant sales back into the base. But really no one solution or no specific groups of solutions were notably bigger than the others. Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Got it. Thanks for taking the question. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Garro of William Blair & Company. Your line is now open. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Good afternoon, guys and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on Mike\'s discussion on Cerner Advance and continuous availability. If I\'m interpreting that correctly, it seems tied to cloud capabilities and remote hosting. So maybe you could update us on the overall penetration of hosting services, and how we should think about whether clients are adopting hosting so that they can take advantage of these additional capabilities, or if they are adopting hosting on a standalone value proposition, and then discovering everything else that they can do to their benefit? Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. So this is Mike. Actually, they are related topics, but there are some distinctions between the two as well. Cerner Advance was really developed to allow us to capture data at a very granular level about the use of our system, and then through our analytics, we can then drive back, in across the entire client base, recommendations for improving the use and effectiveness of our solutions. Now if you tie that to – and that advantage can be realized whether you\'re hosting – whether we\'re hosting the system for them or not. But if we look at our hosting capabilities today, probably 75% to 80% of our clients run out of our data center, and all new deals are within that model. And you are correct that we do have an advantage when we run those systems, we have the ability to keep our clients current, refresh their software more easily with less effort, and allow them to drive the value more quickly. So it doesn\'t necessarily have to be cloud-based, it\'s just a fact that now by operating within our environment we can do things that maybe wouldn\'t be – they couldn\'t do on their own. So it is a huge advantage that we leverage significantly. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Great, and if I can squeeze one in for Marc, wanted to ask if there\'s any update to metrics you\'ve given before on revenue visibility, like the percentage growth needed from bookings for the year or amount of revenue for the remainder of the year coming from backlog that enhances your visibility on the forward outlook? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Usually that\'s a – those are data points, Jeff, that we provide at the beginning of the year to kind of give you a sense when we\'re providing an annual guidance, we don\'t update those throughout the year. Obviously when you get – go from a 12-month view to a 90-day view, your visibility is a higher percent than we would have talked about coming from backlog earlier, but we don\'t – we do not update those during the year. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC No problem. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. Why don\'t we take one more question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Great, good afternoon. I was curious when you talk about large ITWorks in the pipeline, if you could help kind of size what that means, and in terms of – this might be a tough question to answer, because I know it will range widely, but what is the typical run rate – revenue run rate of a "large" ITWorks contract? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. This is Marc. It\'s really hard to give you an average, because we have 25 clients now, and they even range within their universe, and that is probably 25 clients that are kind of at the lower end. I mean, if you were looking kind of what our current clients in that – in our current range is, it\'s probably $20 million a year, which includes not only their ITWorks components, but all the revenue that\'s coming from that client, which would be licensed software, support, all the elements, because we combine all those. Once an ITWorks deal is done, the ITWorks team owns that client regardless where the revenue is coming from. So, that gives you – kind of gives you a sense of what\'s in the current base. As we look forward, you have some that are that size, you have some that could be five times that size. So the opportunity, when we talk about bigger ones, we\'re talking about multiple – opportunities that could be multiples bigger from an annual revenue standpoint, when you do this all-inclusive view. So that\'s – for us that\'s kind of the next step, once we\'ve gotten the standalone or smaller clients, trying to move it upscale. And as Zane said, the current environment of people focusing on cost is making them consider doing an outsourcing, where they might not have before. Once again, why the industry really doesn\'t have a history of outsourcing. We\'re not going in to compete against an existing outsourcer. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. And when you win these deals, it takes time for that revenue to kick in, I understand. How late this year is a sort of a cut-off for deals sort of impacting 2018, as we start thinking about ITWorks possibly rebounding in 2018? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, this is Zane. I\'d say there is – there are implications in the current quarter of signing, so you do see positive earnings and revenue from ITWorks in the quarter they sign. Obviously it depends on what point in the quarter that has does happen. But it\'s more of a run rate that\'s begun once that opportunity is completed. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. Usually these deals you sign and rebadge simultaneously, because it\'s all part of a ... Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Okay. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. ... communication process. So really the month you sign it, is the first month of that sequential revenue comes. So, you can – if you sign stuff in Q2 and Q3, it will have a fairly full Q impact beginning in the next quarter. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Right. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.

Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp. Thanks, Shawn. We had a strong start to the year. Highlighting our record first quarter was a near tripling of data center revenue, reflecting surging interest in artificial intelligence. Overall, quarterly revenue reached $1.94 billion, up 48% from the year earlier, down 11% sequentially and above our outlook of $1.9 billion. Growth remained broad-based, with year-on-year gains in each of our four platforms, gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. From a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 45% to $1.56 billion from a year earlier, and Tegra processor revenue more than doubled to $332 million. And we recognized the remaining $43 million in revenue from our Intel agreement. Let's start with our gaming platforms. Gaming revenue in the first quarter was $1.03 billion, up 49% year on year. Gamers continue to show great interest in the Pascal-based GPUs, including gaming notebooks. Our Tegra gaming platform also did extremely well. Demand remained healthy for our enthusiast class GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, introduced nearly a year ago. It was complemented this past quarter with the GTX 1080 Ti, which runs 35% faster and was launched at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The GTX 1080 Ti is designed to handle the demands of 4K gaming and high-end VR experiences. Typical of many supportive reviews, Ars Technica stated it is undoubtedly a fantastic piece of engineering, cool, quiet, and without rival. Those that demand the absolute very best in cutting-edge graphics need look no further. We also released the next generation of our TITAN-class product, the TITAN Xp, designed for enthusiasts and researchers who demand extreme performance. Gaming continues to be driven by the headlong growth in e-sports. The newest title, Overwatch, added 30 million gamers in its first year. GeForce was the graphics platform of choice at all the top e-sports tournaments, including the finals of the big four international competitions. With apologies to the start of the baseball season, e-sports is now as popular among U.S. male millennials as America's favorite pastime. More people watch gaming than HBO, Netflix, ESPN, and Hulu combined. GeForce sales remained underpinned by the steady stream of AAA titles coming onto market, which continued to push for more chip GPU performance. In the months ahead, we'll see a series of highly anticipated blockbuster titles. Among them are Destiny 2 coming to the PC for the first time, Star Wars Battlefront II, Shadow of War, and the next installment of the Call of Duty franchise, World War II. We are excited to be working within Nintendo on its acclaimed Switch gaming system. Great reviews and reports of the system selling out in many geographies are a strong part of this platform. Moving to professional visualization, Quadro revenue grew to $205 million, up 8% from a year ago, amid continued demand for high-end real-time rendering and more powerful mobile workstations. We are seeing significant increase in professional VR solutions, driven by Quadro P6000 GPUs. Lockheed Martin is deploying Quadro to create realistic VR walk-throughs of the U.S. Navy's most advanced ships. The Marines utilize VR to train air crew personnel. And IKEA is rolling out VR to many of its stores, helping consumers configure their kitchens from a huge array of options, which they can visualize in sharp detail. Next, data center, record revenue of $409 million was nearly triple that of a year ago. The 38% rise from Q4 marked its seventh consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Driving growth was demand from cloud service providers and enterprises building training clusters for web services, plus strong gains in high-performance computing, GRID graphics virtualization, and our DGX-1 AI super-computer. AI has quickly emerged as the single most powerful force in technology, and at the center of AI are NVIDIA GPUs. All of the world's major Internet and cloud service providers now use NVIDIA Tesla-based GPU accelerators, AWS, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft as well as Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent. We also announced that Microsoft is bringing NVIDIA Tesla P100 and P40 GPUs to its Azure cloud. Organizations are increasingly building out AI-enabled applications using training clusters, evident in part by growing demand for DGX-1. We are seeing a number of significant deals. Among them are Fujitsu's installment of 24 systems integrated into an AI supercomputer for RIKEN, Japan's largest research center, as well as new supercomputers at Oxford University, GE, and Audi. Working with Facebook, we announced the launch of the Caffe2 deep learning framework as well as Big Basin servers with Tesla P100 GPUs. To help meet huge demand for expertise in the field of AI, we announced earlier today plans to train 100 people this year through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, representing a 10x increase from last year. Through onsite training, public events, and online courses, DLI provides practical training on the tools of AI to developers, data scientists, and researchers. Our HPC business doubled year on year, driven by the adoption of Tesla GPUs into supercomputing centers worldwide. The use of AI and accelerated computing in HPC is driving additional demand in governance intelligence, higher education research, and finance. Our GRID graphics virtualization business more than tripled, driven by growth in business services, education, and automotive. Intuit's latest TurboTax release deploys GRID to connect tax filers seeking real-time advice with CPAs. And Honda is using GRID to bring together engineering and design teams based in different countries. Finally, automotive, revenue grew to a record $140 million, up 24% year over year and 9% sequentially, primarily from infotainment modules. We are continuing to expand our partnerships with companies using AI to address the complex problems of autonomous driving. Since our DRIVE PX 2 AI car platform began shipping just one year ago, more than 225 car and truck makers, suppliers, research organizations, and startups have begun developing with it. That number has grown by more than 50% in the past quarter alone, the result of the platform's enhanced processing power and the introduction of Tensor RT for its in-vehicle AI inferencing. This quarter, we announced two important partnerships. Bosch, the world's largest auto supplier, which does business all over the world's carmakers, is working to create a new AI self-driving car computer based on our Xavier platform. And PACCAR, one of the largest truck makers, is developing self-driving solutions for Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF. We continue to view AI as the only solution for autonomous driving. The nearly infinite range of road conditions, traffic patterns, and unexpected events are impossible to anticipate with hand-coded software or computer vision alone. We expect our DRIVE PX 2 AI platform to be capable of delivering Level 3 autonomy for cars, trucks, and shuttles by the end of the year, with Level 4 autonomy moving into production by the end of 2018. Now turning to the rest of the Q1 income statement, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter were 59.4% and 59.6% respectively, reflecting the decline in Intel licensing revenue. Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $596 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $517 million, up 17% from a year ago, reflecting hiring for our growth initiative. GAAP operating income was $554 million and non-GAAP operating income was $637 million, nearly doubling from a year ago. For the first quarter, GAAP net income was $507 million. Non-GAAP net income was $533 million, more than doubling from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion. For fiscal 2018, we intend to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. In Q1, we issued $82 million in quarterly cash dividends. Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be $1.95 billion plus or minus 2%. Excluding the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement, total revenue is expected to grow 3% sequentially. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.4%, 58.6% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points. These reflect approximately a 100 basis points impact from the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $605 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $530 million. GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $8 million, inclusive of additional charges from early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $3 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 are both expected to be 17% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. Finally, this week we are sponsoring our annual GPU Technology Conference here in Silicon Valley. Reflecting the surging importance of accelerating computing, GTC has grown to more than 7,000 attendees from 60 countries, up from 1,000 when we started eight years ago. Among its highlights, Jen-Hsun will deliver a news-filled keynote tomorrow morning. We have 550-plus talks, more than half on AI. Developers will have access to 70 labs and workshops to learn about deep learning and GPU computing. And we will award a total of $1.5 million to the six most promising companies among the 1,300 in our Inception program for AI startups. We will be hosting our annual Investor Day tomorrow and hope to see many of you there. We will now open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two. Operator, will you please poll for the questions? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC Thanks for taking my questions. On the HPC and data center business, clearly impressive growth, and I'm hoping that you can maybe drill down on the drivers here. I guess on the cloud side, we think of two different areas: GPU as a service versus the cloud companies' own AI effort. And I'm hoping you could help us understand to the extent where the demand is falling into either one of those buckets. And then on the enterprise side, I think there's a view out there that the enterprise is going to the cloud. So to hear you talk about training clusters for web services is very interesting, and I was hoping you could provide some more color on that demand driver. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yeah, Mark, thanks for your question. So our GPU computing business for data center is growing very fast, and it's growing on multiple dimensions. On the one hand, there's high-performance computing using traditional numerical methods. We call that HPC. That's growing. There's in enterprise the virtualization of graphics. There's a whole lot of desktop PCs running around. However, more and more people would like to have thinner laptops or they would like to have a different type of computer and still be able to run Windows. And they would like to virtualize basically their entire PC and put it in the data center. It's easier to manage. The total cost of ownership is lower. And mobile employees could enjoy their work wherever they happen to be. And so the second pillar of that is called GRID, and it's basically virtualizing the PC. And as you can tell, virtualization, mobility, better security, those are all driving forces there. And then there's the Internet companies. And the Internet companies, as you mentioned, really have two pillars. There's the Internet service provision part, where they're using deep learning for their own applications, whether it's photo tagging or product recommendation or recommending a restaurant or something you should buy or personalizing your webpage, helping you with search, provisioning up the right apps, the right advertisement, language translation, speech recognition, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of amazing applications that are made possible by deep learning. And so Internet service providers are using it for internal application development. And then lastly, what you mentioned is cloud service providers. And basically, because of the adoption of GPUs and because of the success of CUDA and so many applications are now able to be accelerated on GPUs, so that we can extend the capabilities of Moore's Law so that we can continue to have the benefits of computing acceleration, which in the cloud means reducing cost. That's on the cloud service provider side of the Internet companies. So that would be Amazon Web Services, it's the Google Compute cloud, Microsoft Azure, the IBM cloud, Alibaba's Aliyun (18:31 – 19:03) by Microsoft Azure. We're starting to see almost every single cloud service around the world standardizing on VM video architecture, so we're seeing a lot of growth there as well. So I think the nut of it all is that we're seeing data center growth and GPU computing across the board. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC As a follow-up if I may, on the gaming side, what we have observed over time is that when you launch a new platform, it definitely creates demand, and you see 12 months of very good visibility into growth. And I was wondering if you see the data center numbers come in quarter after quarter here. To what extent do you think the data center demand that you're seeing is – I know probably you're only able to answer qualitatively. But to what extent do you think the data center is secular versus you have a new platform and there's just platform-driven demand? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. PC gaming is growing. There's no question about that. E-sports is growing the number of players in e-sports. The number of people who are enjoying e-sports is growing. MOBA [Multiplayer Online Battle Arena] is growing. I think it's amazing the growth of MOBA and the latest games. And of course, the first-party titles, the AAA titles are doing great. Battlefield is doing great, and I'm looking forward to the new Battlefield. I'm looking forward to the new Star Wars and I'm looking forward to the first time that Destiny is coming to the PC. As you know, it was a super hit on consoles, but the first-generation Destiny wasn't available on PC. Destiny 2 is coming to the PC, so I think the anticipation is pretty great. So I would say that PC gaming continues to grow, and it's hard to imagine people [audio gap] (21:03 – 21:39) around in another amazing world. So I think people are going to be amazed at how long the alternate reality of the videogame market is going to continue. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the solid results and execution. Jen-Hsun, for my first one, it's on the competitive landscape in your data center business. There has been more noise around FPGA or CPU or ASIC solutions also chasing the same market. What do you think is NVIDIA's sustainable competitive advantage? And what role is CUDA playing in helping you maintain this lead in this business? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Vivek, thanks for the question. First of all, it's really important to understand that the data centers, the cloud service providers, the Internet companies, they all get lumped together in one conversation. But obviously, the way they use computers are very different. There are three major pillars of computing up in the cloud or in large data centers, hyperscale. One pillar is just internal use of computing systems, for developing, for training, for advancing artificial intelligence. That's a high-performance computing problem. It's a very complicated software problem. The algorithms are changing all the time. They're incredibly complicated. The work that the AI researchers are doing are not trivial, and that's why they're in such great demand. And it's also the reason why computing resources have to be provisioned to them so that they can be productive. Having a scarce AI researcher waiting around for a computer to finish simulation or training is really quite unacceptable. And so that first pillar is the market that we – is a segment of the (23:46 – 24:18) once the network is trained, it is put into production. Like for example, your Alexa speakers have a little tiny network inside. And so obviously, you can do inferencing on Alexa. It does voice recognition on a hot keyword. In the long term, your car will be able to do voice recognition and speech recognition. (24:42) Are we okay? Are we still on? Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yes. I think the... Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. No, Vivek, I was wondering whether the phone line was cut or not. So anyways, the second pillar is inferencing. And inferencing as it turns out is far, far less complicated than training. It's a trillion times less complicated, a billion times. It's a trillion times less complicated. And so once the network is trained, it can be deployed. And there are thousands of networks that are going to be running inside these hyperscale data centers, thousands of different networks, not one, thousands of different types. And they're detecting all kinds of different things. They're inferring all kinds of different things, classifying, predicting, all kinds of different things, whether it's photo or voice or videos or searches or whatnot. And in that particular case, our advantage – in that particular case, the current incumbent is CPUs. The CPU is really the only processor at the moment that has the ability to basically run every single network. And I think that's a real opportunity for us, and it's a growth opportunity for us. And one would suggest that FPGA is as well. One would suggest that ASICs like TPUs, TPUs and ASIC is as well. And I would urge you to come to the keynote tomorrow, and maybe I'll say a few words about that tomorrow as well. And then the last pillar is cloud service providers, and that's basically the outward public cloud provisioning a computing approach. It's not about provisioning inferencing. It's not about provisioning GPUs. It's really provisioning a computing platform. And that's one of the reasons why the NVIDIA CUDA platform and all of our software stack that we've created over time, whether it's for deep learning or molecular dynamics or all kinds of high-performance computing codes or linear algebra or computer graphics, all of our different software stacks make our cloud computing platform valuable, and that's why it's become the industry standard for GPU computing. And so those are three different pillars of hyperscalers, and it's just important to segment them so that we don't get confused. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch That's very helpful. And as my quick follow-up, Jen-Hsun, there is a perception that your gaming business has been driven a lot more by pricing and adoption of more premium product, and hence there could be some kind of feeling to how much gamers are willing to pay for these products. Could you address that? Are you seeing the number of gamers and the number of cards grow, and how long can they continue to reach for more premium products? Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. The average selling price of the NVIDIA GeForce is about a third of a game console. That's the way to think about it. That's the simple math. People are willing to spend $200, $300, $400, $500 for a new game console, and the NVIDIA GeForce GPU PC gaming card is on average far less. There are people who just absolutely demand the best. And the reason for that is because they're driving a monitor or they're driving multiple monitors at a refresh rate well beyond a TV. So if you have a 4K or you want 120 hertz or some people are even driving it to 200 hertz, those kind of displays demand a lot more horsepower to drive than an average television, whether it's 1080p or 4K at 60 frames a second or 30 frames a second. And so the amount of horsepower they need is great. But that's just because they just really love their rig, and they're surrounded in it, and they just want the best. But the way to think about that is ultimately that's the opportunity for us. I think GeForce is a game console. And the right way to think about that is at an equivalent ASP of some $200 – $300, that's probably potentially an opportunity ahead for GeForce. Operator Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Good afternoon, thank you for taking my questions. I guess first question is around gaming. I was hoping you could walk through how you're thinking about seasonality here in calendar 2017, particularly as Pascal launch calendarizes and you get both to launch coming I presume early 2018. I would love to hear your thoughts on how we should think about the trajectory of that business. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. First of all, GeForce is sold a unit at a time and it's sold all over the world and it's a consumer product. It's a product that is sold both into our installed base as well as growing our installed base. When we think about GeForce, these are the parameters involved. How much of our installed base has upgraded to Pascal? How much of our installed base is growing? How is gaming growing overall? What are the driving dynamics of gaming, whether it's team sports or MOBA or using games for artistic expression? It's related to the AAA titles that are coming out. Some years the games are just incredible. Some years the games are less incredible. These days the production quality of the games have just become systematically so good that we've had years now of blockbuster hits. So these are really the dimensions of it. And then it's overlaid on top of it with some seasonality because people do buy graphics cards and game consoles for Christmas and the holidays, and there are international holidays where people are given money as gifts and they save up the money for a new game console or a new game platform. And so in a lot of ways our business is driven by games, so it's not unlike the characteristics of the rest of the gaming industry. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, on the inventory side, that grew I think 3% sequentially. Can you walk through the moving parts there? What's driving that, and is foundry diversification part of that? Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. The driving reasons for inventory growth is new products, and that's probably all I ought to say for now. I would come to GTC. Come to the keynote tomorrow. I think it will be fun. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Great, thanks a lot. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yeah, thanks, C.J. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, congrats on the strong quarter. Jen-Hsun, can you maybe talk a little bit about the breadth of your customer base in data center relative to maybe 12 months ago? Are you seeing the same customer group buy more GPUs, or is the growth in your business more a function of the broadening of your customer base? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Thanks, Toshiya. Let me think here. I think one year ago – one year ago was – maybe it was two years ago. Maybe it was somewhere between 18 months ago or so when I think Jeff Dean gave a talk where he said that Google was using a lot of GPUs for deep learning. I think it wasn't much longer ago than that, and really that was the only public customer that we had in the hyperscale data center. Fast-forward a couple years, we now have basically everybody. Every hyperscaler in the world is using NVIDIA for either deep learning, for some announcements that you'll read about in data center deployment, tomorrow hopefully. And then a lot of them have now standardized on provisioning the NVIDIA architecture in the cloud. And so I guess in the course of one or two years, we went from basically hyperscale being an insignificant part of our overall business to quite a large part of our business, and as you can see, also the fastest-growing part of the business. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. And then as my follow-up, I had a question for Colette. Three months ago, I think you went out of your way to guide data center up sequentially. And for the July quarter, ex the Intel business going away, you're guiding revenue up 3% sequentially. Can you maybe provide some additional color for the individual segment? Thank you. Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp. Thanks for the question. We feel good about the guidance that we're providing for Q2. We wanted to make sure that it was understood the impact of Intel that's incorporated in there. It's still too early, given that it's – to say about the same size of what we just finished in Q1 to make comments specifically exactly where we think each one of those businesses will end up. But again, we do believe data center is a super-great opportunity for us. I think you'll hear more about that tomorrow. But we don't have any more additional details on our guidance, but we feel good about the guidance that we gave. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and guide. Jen-Hsun, can you talk about the adoption of GPU in the cloud? At the CES earlier this year, you guys announced GeForce NOW. Curious how the adoption of GeForce is going. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yes, Atif, thanks for the question. GeForce NOW is really an exciting platform. It virtualizes GeForce. It puts it in the cloud, turns it into a gaming PC that's a service, that can be streamed as a service. And I said at GTC that around this time that we'll likely open it up for external beta. We've been running internal beta for some time, and we'll shortly go to external beta. And the last time I checked, there's many, many tens of thousands of people who are signed up for external beta trials. And so I'm looking forward to letting people try it. But the important thing to realize about that is that's still years away from really becoming a major gaming service. And it's still years away from being able to find the right balance between cost and quality of service and the pervasiveness of virtualizing a gaming PC. So we've been working on it for several years, and these things take a while. My personal experience is almost every great thing takes about a decade. And if that's so, then we've got a few more years to go. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Great. As a follow-up, with your win and success in Nintendo Switch, does that open up the console market with other console makers? Is that a business that is of interest to you? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Consoles is not really a business to us. It's a business to them. And we're selected to work on these consoles. And if it makes sense and the strategic alignment is great and we're in a position to be able to do it, because the opportunity cost of building a game console is quite high. The number of engineers who know how to build computing platforms like this – and in the case of the Nintendo Switch, it's just an incredible console that fits in such a small form factor. And it could both be a mobile gaming device as well as a console gaming device. It's just really quite amazing, and they just did an amazing job. Somebody asked me a few months ago before it was launched how I thought it was going to do. And of course without saying anything about it, I said that it delighted me in a way that no game console has done in the last 10 – 15 years. And it's true, this is a really, really innovative product and really quite ingenious. And if you ever have a chance to get it in your hands, it's just really delightful. And so in that case, the opportunity to work on it was just really, really too enticing. We really wanted to do it, but it always requires deep strategic thought because it took several hundred engineers to work on, and they could be working on something else like all of the major initiatives we have. And so we have to be mindful about the strategic opportunity cost that goes along with these. But in the case of the Nintendo Switch, it's just a home run. I'm so glad I did it, and it was the perfect collaboration for us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the real strong execution. I wanted to follow up on some of the prepared comments on automotive with my first question, and it's this. I think Colette mentioned that there were 225 car and truck development engagements that were underway, up 50% in the last quarter. The question is, as you engage with those partners, what's NVIDIA finding in terms of the time from engagement to revenue generation? And what are you finding with your hit rate in terms of converting those individual engagements into revenues? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. I know the second one easier. The second one is the revenue contribution is not significant at the time – at this moment. But I expect it to be high, and that's why we're working on it. The 200 developers who are working on the DRIVE PX platform are doing it in a lot of different ways. And at the core, it's because in the future, every aspect of transportation will be autonomous. And if you think through what's going on in the world, one of the most important and powerful effects that's happening right now is the Amazon effect. We're grabbing our phone, we're buying something, and we expect it to be delivered to us tomorrow. When you sent up those set of electronic instruction, the next thing that had to happen is a whole bunch of trucks have to move around, and they have to go from trucks to maybe smaller trucks and from smaller trucks to maybe a small van that ultimately delivers it to your house. And so if you will, transportation is the physical Internet. It's the atomic Internet. It's the molecular Internet of society. And without it, everything that we're experiencing today wouldn't be able to continue to scale. And so you could imagine everything from autonomous trucks to autonomous cars surely and autonomous shuttles and vans and motorcycles and small pizza delivery robots and drones and things like that. And for a long time, it's going to augment truck drivers and delivery professionals, who quite frankly we just don't have enough of. The world is just growing too fast in an instant delivery delivered to your home, delivered to you right now phenomenon, and we just don't have enough delivery professionals. And so I think autonomous capability is going to make it possible for us to take pressure off that system and reduce the amount of accidents and make it possible for that entire infrastructure to be a lot more productive. And so that's one of the reasons why you're seeing so much enthusiasm. It's not just the branded cars. I think the branded cars get a lot of attention and we're excited about our partnerships there. And gosh, I love driving autonomous cars. But in the final analysis, I think the way to think about the autonomous future is every aspect of mobility and transportation and delivery will have autonomous – will be augmented by AI. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC That's very helpful color, Jen-Hsun. The follow-up is related to the data center business, and you provided a lot a very useful customer and other information. My question is higher level. Given your very unique position in helping to nurture AI for the last many years and your deep insights into the way that customers are adopting this, as investors try and understand the sustainability of recent growth, can you help us understand where you believe AI adoption is overall? And since Colette threw out a baseball comment earlier, if we thought about AI adoption in reference to a nine-inning game, where are we in that nine-inning game? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Let's see here. It's a great question, and there are a couple ways to come at it. First of all, AI is going to infuse all of software. AI is going to eat software. Whereas Marc [Andreessen] said that software is going to eat the world, AI is going to eat software, and it's going to be in every aspect of software. Every single software developer has to learn deep learning. Every single software developer has to apply machine learning. Every software developer will have to learn AI. Every single company will use AI. AI is the automation of automation, and it will likely be the transmission. We're going to for the first time see the transmission of automation the way we're seeing the transmission and wireless broadcast of information for the very first time. I'm going to be able to send you automation, send you a little automation by email. And so the ability for AI to transform industry is well understood now. It's really about automation of everything, and the implication of it is quite large. We've been using now deep learning – we've been in the area of deep learning for about six years. And the rest of the world has been focused on deep learning for about somewhere between one to two, and some of them are just learning about it. And almost no companies today use AI in a large way. So on the one hand, we know now that the technology is of extreme value, and we're getting a better understanding of how to apply it. On the other hand, no industry uses it at the moment. The automotive industry is in the process of being revolutionized because of it. The manufacturing industry will be. Everything in transport will be. Retail, e-tail, everything will be. And so I think the impact is going to be large, and we're just getting started. We're just getting started. Now that's kind of a first inning thing. The only trouble with a baseball analogy is that in the world of tech, things don't – every inning is not the same. In the beginning the first inning feels like – it feels pretty casual and people are enjoying peanuts. The second inning for some reason is shorter and the third inning is shorter than that and the fourth inning is shorter than that. And the reason for that is because of exponential growth. Speed is accelerating. And so from the bystanders who are on the outside looking in, by the time the third inning comes along, it's going to feel like people are traveling at the speed of light next to you. If you happen to be on one of the photons, you're going to be okay. But if you're not on the deep learning train in a couple of two, three innings, it's gone. And so that's the challenge of that analogy because things aren't moving in linear time. Things are moving exponentially. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities. Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc. Thank you. Congratulations, guys. Hey, Jen-Hsun, can you give us like a state of the union on process node and technology roadmaps that you guys see? Intel made a pretty nice exposition of where they are in terms of their transistors and so on. So what's your comfort level as you see process technology and your roadmaps for new GPUs? Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yes. Hi, Hans. I think there are a couple of ways to think about it. First of all, we know that this is the – we know that some – the world calls it the end of Moore's Law, but it's really the end of two dynamics that has happened. And one dynamic of course is the end of processor architecture productive innovation, end of instruction-level parallelism advances. The second is the end of Dennard scaling. And the combination of those two things makes it look like it's the end of Moore's Law. The easy way to think about that is that we can no longer rely – if we want to advance computing performance, we can no longer rely on transistor advances alone. That's one of the reasons why NVIDIA has never been obsessed about having the latest transistors. We want the best transistors. There's no question about it, but we don't need it to advance. And the reason for that is because we advance computing on such a multitude of levels, all the way from architecture, this architecture we call GPU accelerated computing, to the software stacks on top, to the algorithms on top, to the applications that we work with. We tune it across the top, from top to bottom all the way from bottom to top. And so as a result, transistors is just one of the 10 things that we use. And like I said, it's really, really important to us. And I want the best, and TSMC provides us the absolute best that we can get, and we push along with them as hard as we can. But in the final analysis, it's one of the tools in the box. Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great, thank you. I've attended GTC the last couple days. I'm really quite impressed by the breadth of presentations and the number of industries you guys are affecting. And I guess, just on that note, how do you think about segmenting the sales effort? Do you have a healthcare vertical, an avionics vertical, a financial vertical, or is it having the best building blocks and you're letting your customers discover stuff? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Thanks a lot, Joe. You answered it right there. It's both of those. The first thing is that we have developed platforms that are useful per industry. And so we have a team working with the healthcare industry. We have a team that's working with the Internet service providers. We have a team that's working with the manufacturing industry. We have a team that's working with the financial services industry. We have a team that's working with media and entertainment and with enterprise, with the automotive industry. And so we have different verticals. We call them verticals, and we have teams of business development people, developer relations, a computational mathematician that works with each one of the industries to optimize their software for our GPU computing platform. And so it starts with developing a platform stack. Of course, one of our most famous examples of that is our gaming business. It's just another vertical for us, and it starts with GameWorks that runs on top of GeForce, and it has its own ecosystem of partners. And so that's for each one of the verticals and each one of the ecosystems. And then the second thing that we do is we have horizontally partner management teams that work with our partners, the OEM partners and the go-to-market partners, so that we could help them succeed. And then of course, we rely a great deal on the extended salesforce of our partners so they can help to evangelize our computing platform all over the world. And so it's this mixed approach between dedicated vertical market business development teams as well as a partnership approach to partner with our OEM partners that has really made our business scale so fast. Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great, that's helpful. Thank you. And then the other question I had was regarding Colette's comment that HPC had doubled year on year. Just wondering if you had any comments on what drove that. And is that an indication of the supercomputer types of businesses, or are there other dynamics in terms of addressing new workloads with HPC products? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. HPC is different than supercomputing. Supercomputing to us is a collection of – not a collection, but is 20 different supercomputing sites around the world. And some of the famous ones, whether it's Oak Ridge or Blue Water at UCSC, you've got TITech in Japan. There are supercomputing centers that are either national supercomputing centers or they could be public and open supercomputing centers for open science. And so we consider those supercomputing centers. High-performance computing is used by companies who are using simulation approaches to develop products or to simulate something. It could be scenarios for predicting equity, or for example, as you guys know, Wall Street is the home of some of the largest supercomputing or high-performance computing centers. The energy industry, Schlumberger, for example, is a great partner of ours, and they have a massive, massive high-performance computing infrastructure. And Procter & Gamble uses high-performance computers to simulate their products. I think last year McDonald's was at GTC, and I hope they come this year as well. And so I think high-performance computing, another way of thinking about it is that more and more people really have to use simulation approaches for product discovery and product design and product simulation and to stress the products beyond what is possible in a physical way so that they understand the tolerance of the products and make sure they're as reliable as possible. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, thanks for taking my questions and nice results. Just curious, Jen-Hsun, you've seen a half dozen, dozen private companies going after the desiccant (54:35) silicon Google TPU. I know you felt the comparison to a CPU maybe wasn't fair, but I was just curious your response to these claims of 10x, 100x, 500x performance better than a GPU. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. It's not that it's not fair. It's just not right; it's not correct. And so in business, who cares about being fair? And so I wasn't looking for fair; I was just looking for right. And so the data has to be correct. It turns out, and I said earlier that our hyperscale businesses have three different pillars. There's training, which our GPUs are quite good at. There's cloud service provision, which is a GPU computing architecture opportunity where CUDA is really the reason why people are adopting it and all the applications that have adopted CUDA over the years. And then there's inferencing, and inferencing is a zero opportunity for us, a zero business for us at the moment. We do 0% of our business in inferencing, and it's 100% on CPUs. And in the case of Google, they did a great thing and built a TPU as an ASIC. And they compared the TPU against one of our older GPUs. And so I published a blog. I wrote a blog to clarify some of the comparisons, and you can look that up. But the way to think about that is our Pascal was probably approximately twice the performance of the TPU, the first-generation TPU. And it's incumbent upon us to continue to drive the performance of inferencing. This is something that's still kind of new for us. And tomorrow I'm probably going to say a few words about inferencing and maybe introduce a few ideas, but inferencing is new to us. There are 10 million CPUs in the world in the cloud, and today many of them are running Hadoop and doing queries and looking up files and things like that. But in the future, the belief is that the vast majority of the world's cloud queries will be inference queries, will be AI queries. Every single query that goes into the cloud will likely have some artificial intelligence network that it processes, and I think that's our opportunity. We have an opportunity to do inferencing better than anybody in the world, and it's up to us to prove it. At the moment, I think it's safe to say that the P40, the Tesla P40 is the fastest on the planet, period. And then from here on forward, it's incumbent upon us to continue to lean into that and do a better job. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks. And then just moving to the gaming GPU side, I was just wondering if you can just talk about the competitive landscape looking back at the last refresh. And then looking forward into the back half of this year, I think your competitors have a new platform. I'm just curious as to your thoughts as to how the share worked out on the previous refresh and then the competitiveness into the second half of this year. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. My assessment is that the competitive position is not going to change. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. That's a short answer, thank you. Operator Your last question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just have one actually on the gaming side. I remember at CES you had mentioned a leasing model that almost effectively target the low-end consumer of gaming products. So I'm just wondering if that will be some catalyst in the back half. Or how do we think about gaming working out in terms of both the leasing model and the year-over-year comparison getting a bit difficult? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Hi, Mitch. I was just talking about that earlier in one of the questions called GeForce NOW. And I announced at CES and I said that right around this time of year we're going to open it up for external beta. We've been running internal beta and closed beta for some time. And so we're looking forward to opening up the external beta. My expectation is that it's going to be some time as we scale that out. It's going to take several years. I don't think it's something that's going to be an overnight success. And as you know, overnight successes don't happen overnight. However, I'm optimistic about the opportunity to extend the GeForce platform beyond the gamers that we currently have in our installed base. There are several billion gamers on the planet. And I believe that every human will be a gamer someday, and every human will have some way to enjoy an alternative universe some way someday. And we would love to be the company that brings it to everybody. And the only way to really do that on a very, very large scale basis and reach all those people is over the cloud. And so I think our PC gaming business is going to continue to be quite vibrant. It's going to continue to advance, and then hopefully we can overlay our cloud reach on top of that over time. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC Got it, thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Thanks a lot, thanks for all the questions today. I really appreciate it. We had another record quarter. We saw growth across our four market platforms. AI is expanding. Data center nearly tripled, large ISP/CSP deployments everywhere. PC gaming is still growing, e-sports, AAA gaming titles fueling our growth there. And we have great games on the horizon. Autonomous vehicles becoming imperative on all sectors of transportations, as we talked about earlier. We have a great position with our DRIVE AI computing platform. And as Moore's Law continues to slow, GPU accelerated computing is becoming more important than ever, and NVIDIA is at the center of that. Don't miss tomorrow's GTC keynote. We'll have exciting news to share, next-generation AI, self-driving cars, exciting partnerships, and more. Thanks, everybody. Operator This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Your first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC Thanks for taking my questions. On the HPC and data center business, clearly impressive growth, and I'm hoping that you can maybe drill down on the drivers here. I guess on the cloud side, we think of two different areas: GPU as a service versus the cloud companies' own AI effort. And I'm hoping you could help us understand to the extent where the demand is falling into either one of those buckets. And then on the enterprise side, I think there's a view out there that the enterprise is going to the cloud. So to hear you talk about training clusters for web services is very interesting, and I was hoping you could provide some more color on that demand driver. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yeah, Mark, thanks for your question. So our GPU computing business for data center is growing very fast, and it's growing on multiple dimensions. On the one hand, there's high-performance computing using traditional numerical methods. We call that HPC. That's growing. There's in enterprise the virtualization of graphics. There's a whole lot of desktop PCs running around. However, more and more people would like to have thinner laptops or they would like to have a different type of computer and still be able to run Windows. And they would like to virtualize basically their entire PC and put it in the data center. It's easier to manage. The total cost of ownership is lower. And mobile employees could enjoy their work wherever they happen to be. And so the second pillar of that is called GRID, and it's basically virtualizing the PC. And as you can tell, virtualization, mobility, better security, those are all driving forces there. And then there's the Internet companies. And the Internet companies, as you mentioned, really have two pillars. There's the Internet service provision part, where they're using deep learning for their own applications, whether it's photo tagging or product recommendation or recommending a restaurant or something you should buy or personalizing your webpage, helping you with search, provisioning up the right apps, the right advertisement, language translation, speech recognition, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of amazing applications that are made possible by deep learning. And so Internet service providers are using it for internal application development. And then lastly, what you mentioned is cloud service providers. And basically, because of the adoption of GPUs and because of the success of CUDA and so many applications are now able to be accelerated on GPUs, so that we can extend the capabilities of Moore's Law so that we can continue to have the benefits of computing acceleration, which in the cloud means reducing cost. That's on the cloud service provider side of the Internet companies. So that would be Amazon Web Services, it's the Google Compute cloud, Microsoft Azure, the IBM cloud, Alibaba's Aliyun (18:31 – 19:03) by Microsoft Azure. We're starting to see almost every single cloud service around the world standardizing on VM video architecture, so we're seeing a lot of growth there as well. So I think the nut of it all is that we're seeing data center growth and GPU computing across the board. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC As a follow-up if I may, on the gaming side, what we have observed over time is that when you launch a new platform, it definitely creates demand, and you see 12 months of very good visibility into growth. And I was wondering if you see the data center numbers come in quarter after quarter here. To what extent do you think the data center demand that you're seeing is – I know probably you're only able to answer qualitatively. But to what extent do you think the data center is secular versus you have a new platform and there's just platform-driven demand? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. PC gaming is growing. There's no question about that. E-sports is growing the number of players in e-sports. The number of people who are enjoying e-sports is growing. MOBA [Multiplayer Online Battle Arena] is growing. I think it's amazing the growth of MOBA and the latest games. And of course, the first-party titles, the AAA titles are doing great. Battlefield is doing great, and I'm looking forward to the new Battlefield. I'm looking forward to the new Star Wars and I'm looking forward to the first time that Destiny is coming to the PC. As you know, it was a super hit on consoles, but the first-generation Destiny wasn't available on PC. Destiny 2 is coming to the PC, so I think the anticipation is pretty great. So I would say that PC gaming continues to grow, and it's hard to imagine people [audio gap] (21:03 – 21:39) around in another amazing world. So I think people are going to be amazed at how long the alternate reality of the videogame market is going to continue. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the solid results and execution. Jen-Hsun, for my first one, it's on the competitive landscape in your data center business. There has been more noise around FPGA or CPU or ASIC solutions also chasing the same market. What do you think is NVIDIA's sustainable competitive advantage? And what role is CUDA playing in helping you maintain this lead in this business? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Vivek, thanks for the question. First of all, it's really important to understand that the data centers, the cloud service providers, the Internet companies, they all get lumped together in one conversation. But obviously, the way they use computers are very different. There are three major pillars of computing up in the cloud or in large data centers, hyperscale. One pillar is just internal use of computing systems, for developing, for training, for advancing artificial intelligence. That's a high-performance computing problem. It's a very complicated software problem. The algorithms are changing all the time. They're incredibly complicated. The work that the AI researchers are doing are not trivial, and that's why they're in such great demand. And it's also the reason why computing resources have to be provisioned to them so that they can be productive. Having a scarce AI researcher waiting around for a computer to finish simulation or training is really quite unacceptable. And so that first pillar is the market that we – is a segment of the (23:46 – 24:18) once the network is trained, it is put into production. Like for example, your Alexa speakers have a little tiny network inside. And so obviously, you can do inferencing on Alexa. It does voice recognition on a hot keyword. In the long term, your car will be able to do voice recognition and speech recognition. (24:42) Are we okay? Are we still on? Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yes. I think the... Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. No, Vivek, I was wondering whether the phone line was cut or not. So anyways, the second pillar is inferencing. And inferencing as it turns out is far, far less complicated than training. It's a trillion times less complicated, a billion times. It's a trillion times less complicated. And so once the network is trained, it can be deployed. And there are thousands of networks that are going to be running inside these hyperscale data centers, thousands of different networks, not one, thousands of different types. And they're detecting all kinds of different things. They're inferring all kinds of different things, classifying, predicting, all kinds of different things, whether it's photo or voice or videos or searches or whatnot. And in that particular case, our advantage – in that particular case, the current incumbent is CPUs. The CPU is really the only processor at the moment that has the ability to basically run every single network. And I think that's a real opportunity for us, and it's a growth opportunity for us. And one would suggest that FPGA is as well. One would suggest that ASICs like TPUs, TPUs and ASIC is as well. And I would urge you to come to the keynote tomorrow, and maybe I'll say a few words about that tomorrow as well. And then the last pillar is cloud service providers, and that's basically the outward public cloud provisioning a computing approach. It's not about provisioning inferencing. It's not about provisioning GPUs. It's really provisioning a computing platform. And that's one of the reasons why the NVIDIA CUDA platform and all of our software stack that we've created over time, whether it's for deep learning or molecular dynamics or all kinds of high-performance computing codes or linear algebra or computer graphics, all of our different software stacks make our cloud computing platform valuable, and that's why it's become the industry standard for GPU computing. And so those are three different pillars of hyperscalers, and it's just important to segment them so that we don't get confused. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch That's very helpful. And as my quick follow-up, Jen-Hsun, there is a perception that your gaming business has been driven a lot more by pricing and adoption of more premium product, and hence there could be some kind of feeling to how much gamers are willing to pay for these products. Could you address that? Are you seeing the number of gamers and the number of cards grow, and how long can they continue to reach for more premium products? Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. The average selling price of the NVIDIA GeForce is about a third of a game console. That's the way to think about it. That's the simple math. People are willing to spend $200, $300, $400, $500 for a new game console, and the NVIDIA GeForce GPU PC gaming card is on average far less. There are people who just absolutely demand the best. And the reason for that is because they're driving a monitor or they're driving multiple monitors at a refresh rate well beyond a TV. So if you have a 4K or you want 120 hertz or some people are even driving it to 200 hertz, those kind of displays demand a lot more horsepower to drive than an average television, whether it's 1080p or 4K at 60 frames a second or 30 frames a second. And so the amount of horsepower they need is great. But that's just because they just really love their rig, and they're surrounded in it, and they just want the best. But the way to think about that is ultimately that's the opportunity for us. I think GeForce is a game console. And the right way to think about that is at an equivalent ASP of some $200 – $300, that's probably potentially an opportunity ahead for GeForce. Operator Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Good afternoon, thank you for taking my questions. I guess first question is around gaming. I was hoping you could walk through how you're thinking about seasonality here in calendar 2017, particularly as Pascal launch calendarizes and you get both to launch coming I presume early 2018. I would love to hear your thoughts on how we should think about the trajectory of that business. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. First of all, GeForce is sold a unit at a time and it's sold all over the world and it's a consumer product. It's a product that is sold both into our installed base as well as growing our installed base. When we think about GeForce, these are the parameters involved. How much of our installed base has upgraded to Pascal? How much of our installed base is growing? How is gaming growing overall? What are the driving dynamics of gaming, whether it's team sports or MOBA or using games for artistic expression? It's related to the AAA titles that are coming out. Some years the games are just incredible. Some years the games are less incredible. These days the production quality of the games have just become systematically so good that we've had years now of blockbuster hits. So these are really the dimensions of it. And then it's overlaid on top of it with some seasonality because people do buy graphics cards and game consoles for Christmas and the holidays, and there are international holidays where people are given money as gifts and they save up the money for a new game console or a new game platform. And so in a lot of ways our business is driven by games, so it's not unlike the characteristics of the rest of the gaming industry. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, on the inventory side, that grew I think 3% sequentially. Can you walk through the moving parts there? What's driving that, and is foundry diversification part of that? Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. The driving reasons for inventory growth is new products, and that's probably all I ought to say for now. I would come to GTC. Come to the keynote tomorrow. I think it will be fun. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Great, thanks a lot. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yeah, thanks, C.J. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, congrats on the strong quarter. Jen-Hsun, can you maybe talk a little bit about the breadth of your customer base in data center relative to maybe 12 months ago? Are you seeing the same customer group buy more GPUs, or is the growth in your business more a function of the broadening of your customer base? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Thanks, Toshiya. Let me think here. I think one year ago – one year ago was – maybe it was two years ago. Maybe it was somewhere between 18 months ago or so when I think Jeff Dean gave a talk where he said that Google was using a lot of GPUs for deep learning. I think it wasn't much longer ago than that, and really that was the only public customer that we had in the hyperscale data center. Fast-forward a couple years, we now have basically everybody. Every hyperscaler in the world is using NVIDIA for either deep learning, for some announcements that you'll read about in data center deployment, tomorrow hopefully. And then a lot of them have now standardized on provisioning the NVIDIA architecture in the cloud. And so I guess in the course of one or two years, we went from basically hyperscale being an insignificant part of our overall business to quite a large part of our business, and as you can see, also the fastest-growing part of the business. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. And then as my follow-up, I had a question for Colette. Three months ago, I think you went out of your way to guide data center up sequentially. And for the July quarter, ex the Intel business going away, you're guiding revenue up 3% sequentially. Can you maybe provide some additional color for the individual segment? Thank you. Colette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp. Thanks for the question. We feel good about the guidance that we're providing for Q2. We wanted to make sure that it was understood the impact of Intel that's incorporated in there. It's still too early, given that it's – to say about the same size of what we just finished in Q1 to make comments specifically exactly where we think each one of those businesses will end up. But again, we do believe data center is a super-great opportunity for us. I think you'll hear more about that tomorrow. But we don't have any more additional details on our guidance, but we feel good about the guidance that we gave. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and guide. Jen-Hsun, can you talk about the adoption of GPU in the cloud? At the CES earlier this year, you guys announced GeForce NOW. Curious how the adoption of GeForce is going. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yes, Atif, thanks for the question. GeForce NOW is really an exciting platform. It virtualizes GeForce. It puts it in the cloud, turns it into a gaming PC that's a service, that can be streamed as a service. And I said at GTC that around this time that we'll likely open it up for external beta. We've been running internal beta for some time, and we'll shortly go to external beta. And the last time I checked, there's many, many tens of thousands of people who are signed up for external beta trials. And so I'm looking forward to letting people try it. But the important thing to realize about that is that's still years away from really becoming a major gaming service. And it's still years away from being able to find the right balance between cost and quality of service and the pervasiveness of virtualizing a gaming PC. So we've been working on it for several years, and these things take a while. My personal experience is almost every great thing takes about a decade. And if that's so, then we've got a few more years to go. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Great. As a follow-up, with your win and success in Nintendo Switch, does that open up the console market with other console makers? Is that a business that is of interest to you? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Consoles is not really a business to us. It's a business to them. And we're selected to work on these consoles. And if it makes sense and the strategic alignment is great and we're in a position to be able to do it, because the opportunity cost of building a game console is quite high. The number of engineers who know how to build computing platforms like this – and in the case of the Nintendo Switch, it's just an incredible console that fits in such a small form factor. And it could both be a mobile gaming device as well as a console gaming device. It's just really quite amazing, and they just did an amazing job. Somebody asked me a few months ago before it was launched how I thought it was going to do. And of course without saying anything about it, I said that it delighted me in a way that no game console has done in the last 10 – 15 years. And it's true, this is a really, really innovative product and really quite ingenious. And if you ever have a chance to get it in your hands, it's just really delightful. And so in that case, the opportunity to work on it was just really, really too enticing. We really wanted to do it, but it always requires deep strategic thought because it took several hundred engineers to work on, and they could be working on something else like all of the major initiatives we have. And so we have to be mindful about the strategic opportunity cost that goes along with these. But in the case of the Nintendo Switch, it's just a home run. I'm so glad I did it, and it was the perfect collaboration for us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the real strong execution. I wanted to follow up on some of the prepared comments on automotive with my first question, and it's this. I think Colette mentioned that there were 225 car and truck development engagements that were underway, up 50% in the last quarter. The question is, as you engage with those partners, what's NVIDIA finding in terms of the time from engagement to revenue generation? And what are you finding with your hit rate in terms of converting those individual engagements into revenues? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. I know the second one easier. The second one is the revenue contribution is not significant at the time – at this moment. But I expect it to be high, and that's why we're working on it. The 200 developers who are working on the DRIVE PX platform are doing it in a lot of different ways. And at the core, it's because in the future, every aspect of transportation will be autonomous. And if you think through what's going on in the world, one of the most important and powerful effects that's happening right now is the Amazon effect. We're grabbing our phone, we're buying something, and we expect it to be delivered to us tomorrow. When you sent up those set of electronic instruction, the next thing that had to happen is a whole bunch of trucks have to move around, and they have to go from trucks to maybe smaller trucks and from smaller trucks to maybe a small van that ultimately delivers it to your house. And so if you will, transportation is the physical Internet. It's the atomic Internet. It's the molecular Internet of society. And without it, everything that we're experiencing today wouldn't be able to continue to scale. And so you could imagine everything from autonomous trucks to autonomous cars surely and autonomous shuttles and vans and motorcycles and small pizza delivery robots and drones and things like that. And for a long time, it's going to augment truck drivers and delivery professionals, who quite frankly we just don't have enough of. The world is just growing too fast in an instant delivery delivered to your home, delivered to you right now phenomenon, and we just don't have enough delivery professionals. And so I think autonomous capability is going to make it possible for us to take pressure off that system and reduce the amount of accidents and make it possible for that entire infrastructure to be a lot more productive. And so that's one of the reasons why you're seeing so much enthusiasm. It's not just the branded cars. I think the branded cars get a lot of attention and we're excited about our partnerships there. And gosh, I love driving autonomous cars. But in the final analysis, I think the way to think about the autonomous future is every aspect of mobility and transportation and delivery will have autonomous – will be augmented by AI. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC That's very helpful color, Jen-Hsun. The follow-up is related to the data center business, and you provided a lot a very useful customer and other information. My question is higher level. Given your very unique position in helping to nurture AI for the last many years and your deep insights into the way that customers are adopting this, as investors try and understand the sustainability of recent growth, can you help us understand where you believe AI adoption is overall? And since Colette threw out a baseball comment earlier, if we thought about AI adoption in reference to a nine-inning game, where are we in that nine-inning game? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Let's see here. It's a great question, and there are a couple ways to come at it. First of all, AI is going to infuse all of software. AI is going to eat software. Whereas Marc [Andreessen] said that software is going to eat the world, AI is going to eat software, and it's going to be in every aspect of software. Every single software developer has to learn deep learning. Every single software developer has to apply machine learning. Every software developer will have to learn AI. Every single company will use AI. AI is the automation of automation, and it will likely be the transmission. We're going to for the first time see the transmission of automation the way we're seeing the transmission and wireless broadcast of information for the very first time. I'm going to be able to send you automation, send you a little automation by email. And so the ability for AI to transform industry is well understood now. It's really about automation of everything, and the implication of it is quite large. We've been using now deep learning – we've been in the area of deep learning for about six years. And the rest of the world has been focused on deep learning for about somewhere between one to two, and some of them are just learning about it. And almost no companies today use AI in a large way. So on the one hand, we know now that the technology is of extreme value, and we're getting a better understanding of how to apply it. On the other hand, no industry uses it at the moment. The automotive industry is in the process of being revolutionized because of it. The manufacturing industry will be. Everything in transport will be. Retail, e-tail, everything will be. And so I think the impact is going to be large, and we're just getting started. We're just getting started. Now that's kind of a first inning thing. The only trouble with a baseball analogy is that in the world of tech, things don't – every inning is not the same. In the beginning the first inning feels like – it feels pretty casual and people are enjoying peanuts. The second inning for some reason is shorter and the third inning is shorter than that and the fourth inning is shorter than that. And the reason for that is because of exponential growth. Speed is accelerating. And so from the bystanders who are on the outside looking in, by the time the third inning comes along, it's going to feel like people are traveling at the speed of light next to you. If you happen to be on one of the photons, you're going to be okay. But if you're not on the deep learning train in a couple of two, three innings, it's gone. And so that's the challenge of that analogy because things aren't moving in linear time. Things are moving exponentially. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities. Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc. Thank you. Congratulations, guys. Hey, Jen-Hsun, can you give us like a state of the union on process node and technology roadmaps that you guys see? Intel made a pretty nice exposition of where they are in terms of their transistors and so on. So what's your comfort level as you see process technology and your roadmaps for new GPUs? Thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Yes. Hi, Hans. I think there are a couple of ways to think about it. First of all, we know that this is the – we know that some – the world calls it the end of Moore's Law, but it's really the end of two dynamics that has happened. And one dynamic of course is the end of processor architecture productive innovation, end of instruction-level parallelism advances. The second is the end of Dennard scaling. And the combination of those two things makes it look like it's the end of Moore's Law. The easy way to think about that is that we can no longer rely – if we want to advance computing performance, we can no longer rely on transistor advances alone. That's one of the reasons why NVIDIA has never been obsessed about having the latest transistors. We want the best transistors. There's no question about it, but we don't need it to advance. And the reason for that is because we advance computing on such a multitude of levels, all the way from architecture, this architecture we call GPU accelerated computing, to the software stacks on top, to the algorithms on top, to the applications that we work with. We tune it across the top, from top to bottom all the way from bottom to top. And so as a result, transistors is just one of the 10 things that we use. And like I said, it's really, really important to us. And I want the best, and TSMC provides us the absolute best that we can get, and we push along with them as hard as we can. But in the final analysis, it's one of the tools in the box. Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great, thank you. I've attended GTC the last couple days. I'm really quite impressed by the breadth of presentations and the number of industries you guys are affecting. And I guess, just on that note, how do you think about segmenting the sales effort? Do you have a healthcare vertical, an avionics vertical, a financial vertical, or is it having the best building blocks and you're letting your customers discover stuff? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Thanks a lot, Joe. You answered it right there. It's both of those. The first thing is that we have developed platforms that are useful per industry. And so we have a team working with the healthcare industry. We have a team that's working with the Internet service providers. We have a team that's working with the manufacturing industry. We have a team that's working with the financial services industry. We have a team that's working with media and entertainment and with enterprise, with the automotive industry. And so we have different verticals. We call them verticals, and we have teams of business development people, developer relations, a computational mathematician that works with each one of the industries to optimize their software for our GPU computing platform. And so it starts with developing a platform stack. Of course, one of our most famous examples of that is our gaming business. It's just another vertical for us, and it starts with GameWorks that runs on top of GeForce, and it has its own ecosystem of partners. And so that's for each one of the verticals and each one of the ecosystems. And then the second thing that we do is we have horizontally partner management teams that work with our partners, the OEM partners and the go-to-market partners, so that we could help them succeed. And then of course, we rely a great deal on the extended salesforce of our partners so they can help to evangelize our computing platform all over the world. And so it's this mixed approach between dedicated vertical market business development teams as well as a partnership approach to partner with our OEM partners that has really made our business scale so fast. Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great, that's helpful. Thank you. And then the other question I had was regarding Colette's comment that HPC had doubled year on year. Just wondering if you had any comments on what drove that. And is that an indication of the supercomputer types of businesses, or are there other dynamics in terms of addressing new workloads with HPC products? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. HPC is different than supercomputing. Supercomputing to us is a collection of – not a collection, but is 20 different supercomputing sites around the world. And some of the famous ones, whether it's Oak Ridge or Blue Water at UCSC, you've got TITech in Japan. There are supercomputing centers that are either national supercomputing centers or they could be public and open supercomputing centers for open science. And so we consider those supercomputing centers. High-performance computing is used by companies who are using simulation approaches to develop products or to simulate something. It could be scenarios for predicting equity, or for example, as you guys know, Wall Street is the home of some of the largest supercomputing or high-performance computing centers. The energy industry, Schlumberger, for example, is a great partner of ours, and they have a massive, massive high-performance computing infrastructure. And Procter & Gamble uses high-performance computers to simulate their products. I think last year McDonald's was at GTC, and I hope they come this year as well. And so I think high-performance computing, another way of thinking about it is that more and more people really have to use simulation approaches for product discovery and product design and product simulation and to stress the products beyond what is possible in a physical way so that they understand the tolerance of the products and make sure they're as reliable as possible. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, thanks for taking my questions and nice results. Just curious, Jen-Hsun, you've seen a half dozen, dozen private companies going after the desiccant (54:35) silicon Google TPU. I know you felt the comparison to a CPU maybe wasn't fair, but I was just curious your response to these claims of 10x, 100x, 500x performance better than a GPU. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. It's not that it's not fair. It's just not right; it's not correct. And so in business, who cares about being fair? And so I wasn't looking for fair; I was just looking for right. And so the data has to be correct. It turns out, and I said earlier that our hyperscale businesses have three different pillars. There's training, which our GPUs are quite good at. There's cloud service provision, which is a GPU computing architecture opportunity where CUDA is really the reason why people are adopting it and all the applications that have adopted CUDA over the years. And then there's inferencing, and inferencing is a zero opportunity for us, a zero business for us at the moment. We do 0% of our business in inferencing, and it's 100% on CPUs. And in the case of Google, they did a great thing and built a TPU as an ASIC. And they compared the TPU against one of our older GPUs. And so I published a blog. I wrote a blog to clarify some of the comparisons, and you can look that up. But the way to think about that is our Pascal was probably approximately twice the performance of the TPU, the first-generation TPU. And it's incumbent upon us to continue to drive the performance of inferencing. This is something that's still kind of new for us. And tomorrow I'm probably going to say a few words about inferencing and maybe introduce a few ideas, but inferencing is new to us. There are 10 million CPUs in the world in the cloud, and today many of them are running Hadoop and doing queries and looking up files and things like that. But in the future, the belief is that the vast majority of the world's cloud queries will be inference queries, will be AI queries. Every single query that goes into the cloud will likely have some artificial intelligence network that it processes, and I think that's our opportunity. We have an opportunity to do inferencing better than anybody in the world, and it's up to us to prove it. At the moment, I think it's safe to say that the P40, the Tesla P40 is the fastest on the planet, period. And then from here on forward, it's incumbent upon us to continue to lean into that and do a better job. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks. And then just moving to the gaming GPU side, I was just wondering if you can just talk about the competitive landscape looking back at the last refresh. And then looking forward into the back half of this year, I think your competitors have a new platform. I'm just curious as to your thoughts as to how the share worked out on the previous refresh and then the competitiveness into the second half of this year. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. My assessment is that the competitive position is not going to change. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. That's a short answer, thank you. Operator Your last question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just have one actually on the gaming side. I remember at CES you had mentioned a leasing model that almost effectively target the low-end consumer of gaming products. So I'm just wondering if that will be some catalyst in the back half. Or how do we think about gaming working out in terms of both the leasing model and the year-over-year comparison getting a bit difficult? Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Hi, Mitch. I was just talking about that earlier in one of the questions called GeForce NOW. And I announced at CES and I said that right around this time of year we're going to open it up for external beta. We've been running internal beta and closed beta for some time. And so we're looking forward to opening up the external beta. My expectation is that it's going to be some time as we scale that out. It's going to take several years. I don't think it's something that's going to be an overnight success. And as you know, overnight successes don't happen overnight. However, I'm optimistic about the opportunity to extend the GeForce platform beyond the gamers that we currently have in our installed base. There are several billion gamers on the planet. And I believe that every human will be a gamer someday, and every human will have some way to enjoy an alternative universe some way someday. And we would love to be the company that brings it to everybody. And the only way to really do that on a very, very large scale basis and reach all those people is over the cloud. And so I think our PC gaming business is going to continue to be quite vibrant. It's going to continue to advance, and then hopefully we can overlay our cloud reach on top of that over time. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC Got it, thank you. Jen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp. Thanks a lot, thanks for all the questions today. I really appreciate it. We had another record quarter. We saw growth across our four market platforms. AI is expanding. Data center nearly tripled, large ISP/CSP deployments everywhere. PC gaming is still growing, e-sports, AAA gaming titles fueling our growth there. And we have great games on the horizon. Autonomous vehicles becoming imperative on all sectors of transportations, as we talked about earlier. We have a great position with our DRIVE AI computing platform. And as Moore's Law continues to slow, GPU accelerated computing is becoming more important than ever, and NVIDIA is at the center of that. Don't miss tomorrow's GTC keynote. We'll have exciting news to share, next-generation AI, self-driving cars, exciting partnerships, and more. Thanks, everybody. Operator This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
