The required definitions and reconciliations, preliminary note and schedules one through three can be found at the end of this presentation. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Maffei. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Maffei Thank you, Operator and good morning to all of you and thank you for joining us and for your continued interest in Liberty Media. Today we’ll discuss the performance in Q2 of the company the operating results of our largest consolidated subsidiaries. Speaking this morning on the call with me we’ve got Liberty Controller Chris Shean, who will discuss the attributed business' financial results and the liquidity picture for each of the trackers; QVC's CEO Mike George; Starz President and COO Bill Meyers; and an assortment of other Liberty, QVC, and Starz executives who are all available to answer your questions.  During the quarter, we continued to see quite strong operating results at Starz and at our e-commerce companies and you will hear more about that from both Chris and from Bill. And importantly we saw improving results at QVC, our largest controlled subsidiary and you will hear more about that from Mike George.  Here at corporate we strengthened the balance sheet considerably, retiring about $1.94 billion face of debt on a corporate wide basis. That included about $750 million of bank debt at QVC and retirement of certain maturities, straight debt and other purchases in the marketplace. All together, we brought that debt in at a discount to face of about $275 million. I think you should expect you will see more debt retirement coming in the quarters ahead.  Our public equity portfolio grew in the quarter nicely about over $2 billion. That was paced by gains in DIRECTV, almost $1 billion; Expedia of over $400 million; the IT spin companies, a substantial gain; and of course SIRIUS XM, which grew over $200 million in the quarter. Since we struck the SIRIUS XM deal back in February/March, we’re over $1.3 billion.  I note, of course, none of those fish are in the boat yet so we are not counting on them but it is nice to see them marked well.  At Liberty Entertainment, as I mentioned, Starz Entertainment had very good results, nice revenue and very strong adjusted OIBDA growth. We continue to make progress on our DIRECTV transaction. With the IRS, we are awaiting a response on our private letter ruling but are confident. At the FCC, it looks like the transaction will be considered pro forma and with the SEC, we expect to re-file with a completed proxy in mid-August and expect to vote in early October.  I note that during the quarter, driven by the share repurchase at DIRECTV, the Liberty interests exceeded [our rates] almost 56%.  At Liberty Interactive, as I mentioned QVC had very strong sequential domestic revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth and the adjusted OIBDA margin increased. The e-commerce companies grew in revenue and adjusted OIBDA in part due to some [inaudible] and importantly, lead by our Treasurer, Dave Flowers, we extended the QVC debt maturity through 2014 and took a lot of pressure off the balance sheet at QVC.  At Liberty Capital, Starz Media revenue and adjusted OIBDA both improved over last year and we continue to make progress on the debt structure, as I noted.  A couple of other things before I turn it over to Chris, we established the media for liberty award to talk about economic freedom and we added a new independent board member, Ian Gilchrist, late of Citibank, and we are happy to have Ian aboard.  So Chris, let me have you start by talking about the lift in financial results.  Chris Shean Thanks, Greg. Liberty Interactive Group’s revenue decreased 1% to $1.9 billion while adjusted OIBDA increased slightly to $412 million for the quarter. QVC, the primary driver of the results amongst the Liberty Interactive attributed businesses, continues to operate at a challenging retail environment and QVC's total revenue decreased 4% to $1.7 billion while adjusted OIBDA decreased 4% to $373 million.  The e-commerce group of companies at Liberty Interactive, which include provide commerce, Backcountry.com, bodybuilding.com, and By Seasons again posted positive financial results. In total, the e-commerce group experienced revenue growth of 31% in the second quarter and adjusted OIBDA grew 56%. The increase in revenue for the quarter was driven by organic growth at all the e-commerce companies, combined with two small fold-in acquisitions made in 2008, which contributed $26 million in revenue during the second quarter.  Included in organic growth for the quarter is about $5 million of commissions earned when customers sign up for a third-party online discount program, which is slightly different than the standard revenue stream that these businesses have.  The increase in adjusted OIBDA was primarily driven by revenue growth as discussed above.  During the second quarter, QVC amended their bank credit facilities and extended maturities through 2014. Concurrently, QVC retired $750 million of loans at par and cancelled another $19 million of un-funded commitments at no cost. The remaining $4.48 billion outstanding principal will mature in six tranches between June 2010 and March 2014.  Cash used to retire the $750 million of loans came from a combination of $250 million of cash from QVC and $500 million in the form of inter-group loans of $250 million from each of the entertainment group and the capital group to the interactive group. The inter-group loans are secured by various public stocks attributed to the interactive group, accrue interest quarterly at a rate of LIBOR plus 500 basis points, and are due in June of 2010.  Additionally, QVC modified their revenue recognition policy through an FOB destination model this quarter. This model was considered more appropriate given QVC's history of providing replacements for goods damaged in transit. As a result of this modification, there has been an immaterial one-time adjustment decreasing revenue by $21 million and adjusted OIBDA by $8 million.  Excluding this adjustment, consolidated revenue would have decreased 3% and adjusted OIBDA would have decreased by 2%.  And with that, I will hand it over to Mike George for additional detailed comments on QVC.  Mike George Thank you, Chris. We were very pleased with our Q2 results, which represented a significant improvement over the trend of the last few quarters. We see these results as a positive sign that our actions are paying off, even as underlying consumer spending remains weak.  In the U.S., net revenue fell 2%, a strong improvement from the negative 9% to 12% trend of the prior three quarters. And we were particularly encouraged by the continued strong growth in QVC.com, which was up over 10% from last year.  As in recent quarters, we saw strong growth in computers and consumer electronics and to a lesser extent, in beauty and handbags. The kitchen and floorcare and fashion jewelry businesses also showed some very nice gains over past trend. And while the apparel business remained soft, the declines have moderated from prior quarters and we increasingly feel that we have real upside in that category as well.  In contrast, the fine jewelry business remains very difficult as it has been for several quarters.  We also saw a significant reduction in return rates in the U.S. from 20% in Q2 of last year to 17% this Q2, driven by product mix and other initiatives we are pursuing.  U.S. adjusted OIBDA declined 3% in the quarter and was down only 1% prior to the revenue recognition adjustment that Chris mentioned. This is a significant improvement from the double-digit declines we experienced in prior quarters. Product margins were down about 60 basis points due primarily to a shift in mix away from higher margin categories and to a lesser extent, increased markdown use in apparel and jewelry as we strive to keep our inventories clean.  Bad debt expense was up 39 basis points. That’s about half of the increase that we experienced in Q1. Our cue card bad debt write-off rate was 7.5%, up from 6.7% in the prior quarter. These results reflect a moderation of the increases we’ve seen for several months and our write-off rates remain well below those of other card issuers as we continue to manage credit conservatively.  These declines were largely offset by significant improvements in our cost structure, including greater productivity in our distribution and call centers and lower freight costs as we implemented several initiatives to optimize our freight network. And we continue to tightly manage inventory with our overall inventory level in the U.S. down 10% from last year.  Turning to the U.K., we saw our sales up 1% in local currency, reversing the negative trend we experienced in Q1. We saw gains in fashion, beauty, and computers offset by some weakness in jewelry and consumer electronics. Adjusted OIBDA was down 1% in local currency, driven by a decline in initial gross margin due in part to the impact of foreign exchange movements. This decline was partially offset by a significant improvement in our fixed cost structure as several cost management initiatives began yielding results.  We successfully managed down our inventory levels in the quarter with ending inventory 15% below year-end levels, although inventory remains about 5% over the same time period last year.  In Germany, net revenue increased 1% in local currency, our fourth consecutive quarterly increase. This largely reflects the success of our strategy to double the beauty and health business, which grew nearly 70% in the quarter, coupled with increases in our footwear and home businesses. These gains were partially offset by continued weakness in jewelry and apparel where we continue to pull back air time to fund these other up-trending categories.  Adjusted OIBDA in Germany was up a strong 12% in local currency, driven by a lower obsolescence rate and improvements in our cost structure. These gains were somewhat offset by a reduction in initial product margin as we cleared out poor performing jewelry items. While we have some more clean-up to do in apparel, we feel that our inventory in Germany is in the best shape we’ve seen in years. Total inventory levels declined 10% over last year and are now at their lowest level since 2006.  In Japan, net revenue was down 3% in local currency. This is the first negative sales result we’ve posted in Japan in several quarters. As I mentioned on the last call, consumer spending in Japan is significantly challenged, impacting our results in the quarter. That said, we continue to take aggressive actions to drive sales. Our fashion and jewelry businesses remain strong and we believe we have real opportunity to improve our home and health and beauty businesses, which can provide upside to the recent trend.  Adjusted OIBDA in Japan was down 4%, largely in line with the revenue decline. We achieved meaningful improvements in our fixed cost structure, offset by the higher cost of television carriage as our sales decline created negative leverage on contracts that charge a fixed fee per subscriber.  Wrapping up, as I mentioned at the outset, we are very encouraged by these results and gratified that our actions are beginning to take hold, offsetting to some degree what continues to be a very weak retail environment in all markets we operate in.  We are seeing the positive results of our ongoing efforts to shift sales into higher performing categories, reduce inventory levels, manage down return rates, and cut expenses.  At the same time, we are continuing to invest in the business, taking advantage of the current crisis to out-innovate the competition. We’re developing new Internet and -- Internet, CRM, and broadcast management platforms which will roll out over the next six to 12 months.  We are continuing to expand our presence in the high definition tier in the U.S. with QVC HD now available in over 15 million homes in the U.S., a significant lead over any other shopping channel.  We continue to add new features to our mobile platform and we are on track with Italy, which will be our fifth market, and scheduled to launch in the fall of next year.  And most importantly, we continue to invest in elevating the shopping experience, offering truly distinctive products and programming to our customers as we strive to make QVC the premiere retail destination. For example, in Q2 we premiered [inaudible] jewelry directly from Istanbul, took our viewers to the Aspen food and wine festival and the Yankee Stadium inaugural season, launched runway designer [Carmen Mark Bolvo’s] home collection, Cindy Crawford’s beauty line, Elisabeth Hasselbeck apparel, and featured the CEW insiders’ choice beauty finalists. And our customers responded strongly to a number of great TSVs in the quarter, ranging from [Duni & Bourke] handbags to a best of Bobbi Brown beauty collection, Dell XPS notebooks, and Sharp Aquos high definition TVs.  Our efforts to redefine the shopping experience were perhaps best exemplified by the recent Wall Street Journal story featuring our new partnership with Isaac Mizrahi. We will be broadcasting several hours of programming monthly with Isaac live from his design studios in New York as we build a lifestyle brand around him, which we expect to become one of our top five brands.  This is creating a great deal of interest in the industry and among customers and non-customers and shines a spotlight on our efforts to move our brand forward and gain market share.  And with that, I will turn it back to Chris.  Chris Shean Let’s move on to Liberty Entertainment. Revenue grew 2% in the second quarter to $367 million while adjusted OIBDA increased 44% to $89 million. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by the results of Starz Entertainment. The increase in adjusted OIBDA was due to positive results of Starz Entertainment partially offset by expenses related to the proposed split-off of the businesses, Liberty Entertainment, LEI. Now Bill Meyers will comment on the events of Starz Entertainment and Media.  Bill Meyers Thank you, Chris. Starz had another strong quarter. Starz Entertainment revenue increased 8% to $296 million and adjusted OIBDA increased 54% to $105 million versus the same period of the prior year. The increase in revenue resulted from an increase in rates and the growth in the average number of subscription units. The higher adjusted OIBDA resulted from the increased revenue and a decrease in operating expenses. The operating expense decrease was due to lower licensing fees for films, somewhat offset by increased expenses for original programming and lower sales and marketing expenses. Versus the first quarter of 2009, Starz subscription units declined 3% and Encore subscription units declined by 1%. This decline in subscriber levels resulted from several factors. Many of our affiliates initiated rate increases in the first half of [the year], from both basic and premium tiers even as the economy caused consumers to tighten their belts. The pace of new home construction has declined sharply, which has lowered new connections for both basic and premium services and during the second quarter, we did not have access to national marketing campaigns with several of our affiliates.  We are currently working with our affiliates on several marketing campaigns to sign up new subs and retain existing subscribers. However, given the current economic conditions, we cannot predict whether or not we will experience further subscriber erosion.  We continue to work to increase the value of Starz's products for our affiliates and consumers. In the past year, we have added such features as more high definition channels and additional on-demand and HD on-demand programming.  An indication that our products can become even more valuable to our affiliates and consumers came this quarter when Comcast announced the trail of a service that will allow existing Comcast Starz subscribers to access Starz's movies and originals over the Internet.  During the quarter, we reached new multi-year affiliation agreements with DIRECTV and DISH Network, two of our largest affiliates. We continue to ramp up our original programming, which allows us to establish a unique identity with our audiences, gives us a library of proprietary programming to which we have unlimited rights, provides a new source of income from syndication, home video, Internet, and other distribution platforms.  In the second quarter, we started production on Spartacus, our new action adventure, hour long dramatic series from Sam Raimi and Rob Tapper that will air on Starz early next year and to which we will hold all rights, international and domestic.  The trailer of Spartacus was well-received at ComicCon and the Television Critics Association tour last month. To depict the world of Roman gladiators, Spartacus employs the cinematic techniques used in the movie 300 and represents a significant departure from any programming ever seen before on television, on either premium or ad-supported channels.  We started production on the second season of Crash, a co-production with Lionsgate, that will air on Starz this fall. The home video version of the first season will street next month, distributed in the U.S. by our sister company, Anchor Bay Entertainment.  We greenlit a second season of party down, the critically acclaimed half hour comedy series and announced that we will air a new half-hour comedy early next year titled failure to fly from two accomplished writer/producers, Eric Shaffer and Jill Franklin.  On the Starz media side, revenue increased by 58% versus the same period in the prior year to $90 million. OIBDA improved from a negative $19 million a year ago to a positive $17 million. The increase in revenue was largely attributable to a $25 million increase in revenue from sales of Starz Media programming to television networks, including $10 million in license fees from the exhibition of Overture Films onto Starz Entertainment networks as we continue to execute on our audience aggregation strategy, under which we produce our own programming and distribute it through multiple platforms.  The improvement in OIBDA resulted from the increased revenue and the timing of film releases by Overture.  The results for Starz Media may vary widely from quarter to quarter, depending largely on the schedule of theatrical releases. For example, with 5 Overture films slated for the release during the remainder of the year versus only one film released in the first half, we can expect an increase in P&A costs in the coming months.  The Overture release, Sunshine Cleaning, finished its theatrical run in the quarter as the highest grossing independent film so far this year. The next Overture film, Paper Heart, opened this week and will be followed in the next two months by Pandorum with Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster; the newest Michael Moore film titled Capitalism: A Love Story; Law-abiding Citizen with Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx; and The Men Who Stare at Ghosts with George Clooney.  Despite the improved revenue and adjusted OIBDA for the quarter, the general economic conditions have impacted the overall theatrical and home video industries, including our businesses, resulting in lower-than-projected revenue for many of our individual productions. We expect these businesses to continue to face challenges until the overall economy improves.  Now I will hand it back to Chris.  Chris Shean Thanks, Bill. Just to provide some top line numbers for Liberty Capital, during the quarter its revenue increased 14% to $199 million while adjusted OIBDA deficit decreased by $44 million for the quarter.  The increase in revenue was principally due to the previously mentioned increase in television revenue from Overture Films. The decrease in adjusted OIBDA deficit was due primarily to the difference in theatrical and home video revenue and related expenses associated with the films released by Overture Films.  Now with all that said, we will turn the call back over to Greg for some concluding remarks.  Greg Maffei Thanks, Chris and thank you to Mike and Bill for the updates on your respective businesses. To conclude, I would note our priorities include at Liberty Entertainment, focusing on completing the split-off of LEI and the merger with DIRECTV and then reclassifying the new tracker Liberty Starz. At Liberty Interactive, we hope to continue to improve the operating performance at QVC as you saw this quarter and continue the strong performance at our e-commerce companies. And at Liberty Capital, we hope to continue to evaluate opportunities for cash on the books. We have done some buy-backs, as you’ve seen. We’ve had some good investment opportunities like SIRIUS XM and we continue to look at stock buy-backs.  Candidly, the markets today are not as appealing in terms of opportunities in the number as when we did the SIRIUS XM transaction but nonetheless, we think there are some and we will be hopefully executing on them.  In addition, we look to rationalize some of our investments in non-strategic assets, non-strategic third-party investments.  So stay tuned for the coming quarters ahead and thank you for listening and with that, Operator, I’d like to open it up to questions.  Question-and-Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Jason Bazinet of Citi. Jason Bazinet - Citigroup I have a quick question on Liberty Capital. When I do my back-of-the-envelope calculation, it seems like the valuation makes sense if you don’t include any equity for the Sirius stake that you have and it seems to not make sense if you include it, and so I was just wondering --  Greg Maffei -- say, Jason, when I’m not sure I agree with the premise of your question because I might think that there’s value in Liberty Capital even without the SIRIUS XM equity attribution, but go ahead with that point. Sorry.  Jason Bazinet - Citigroup And so my question is can you just sort of help investors sort of understand how you might help Sirius to the extent they need financing and how valuable that asset and our NOLs are to you if it does go bankrupt? In other words, it’s not -- it seems to me the market should be included and I’m a little mystified why they aren’t because I guess my hypothesis, you sort of have an incentive to sort of make sure that Sirius remains a viable entity. Any comments would be helpful. Thanks.  Greg Maffei Sure. I think when we struck the SIRIUS XM deal, Dave Flower our Treasurer said to me this is either a bottom or -- because you don’t put senior debt in at a $1 billion valuation and get 40% of the equity, or we’re just -- you know, it’s a fraud and we’ve just missed it. And we’re obviously convinced that was a bottom and the result of SIRIUS XM since have seen to demonstrate that. I believe at the time they were talking about 300 of EBITDA and the market didn’t believe it. Then they talked about 350 of EBITDA as they reported Q1. Now they reported Q2 and they have raised their numbers I believe to 400 of EBITDA and frankly, I don’t think I am underselling Mel here when I tell you I think they are going to significantly exceed 400 million of EBITDA. So I am very comfortable that our debt there is money good and that the equity valuation, while one can argue about how aggressive it is on a multiple basis, you’d be hard pressed to find a [stale] media company out there growing at the rates that this company is growing this year and I believe will grow over the next couple or three years without much improvement if any in the auto market.  Cost savings around content, around OEM deals, around the merger and production and operating costs are driving that growth and will and as our Chairman likes to say, if the auto market comes back stronger than we are anticipating, forget cash for clunkers but over the next couple of years, that’s a lucky strike extra.  So I am very comfortable talking about things like what might happen in a bankruptcy and how we might be able to capture the NOLs -- those are all ideas that we might have had back in February and March but those are very distant ideas today and we are talking about how much this equity is worth.  So I think this is a great business. They are unfortunately refinancing -- did refinance and I suspect will refinance more of the senior debt that we bought. The good news, they will take our money off the table and validate the equity story and lower their cost of capital. The bad news is we were getting very high rates of interest paid to us on that senior debt and we will no longer be collecting that. So we have mixed motivations on that.  Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Understood. Very helpful. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question will come from Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Thanks very much. Just a few detail questions -- one, Greg, are you able to tell us what the cash balance was between Starz and LEI it was at quarter end and tying out to what was on the balance sheet? Greg Maffei Sorry, Doug, let me make sure I understand this -- you’re saying what was in Liberty Entertainment, how much will end up at Liberty Starz and how much will end up at LEI? Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Yes, in aggregate --  [Multiple Speakers] Greg Maffei Okay, let me let my able folks in the room do some calculating, make sure we get that right for you. We’ll come back to that one. Keep going.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank The second one, you talked about selling shares at Sprint and [Moat]. Is that done? Are you fully sold out of those positions and what does that do with regard to the impact on the derivatives you have and the borrowing and any potential tax liability there would be helpful.  Greg Maffei I don’t think we’re disclosing whether we’ve sold those out just because we don’t want to create any overhand in the marketplace on that but it’s safe to say we are at the right price. We’re happy to be sellers of those assets and we don’t believe it has any impact on the underlying derivatives in our tax position.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank And then you talked about an interest in repurchasing more of your debt over the coming quarters. Is the thought there -- could you be anymore specific? Is this an LCAPA specific event since that seems to be where it is sourced in terms of open market purchases or tenders or any additional details there? Greg Maffei Well, if you look at the debt we have post a spin merge with DIRECTV, there will be no debt at Liberty Starz -- it only has cash and excluding the fees debt at LCAPA because when I talk about the fees, I am talking about the Sprint callers which are offset by the Sprint borrowing. That’s really neutral.  You know, we have those exchangeables which we’re trading at a discount and at the right time and place, we valuating our investment opportunities in Liberty Capital, we’ll look at whether we’ll purchase third party investments or we’re purchasing debt or equity, which of those three is the most attractive. So that’s certainly possible.  Liberty Interactive is a little tougher. It does not have -- while it has a great cash flow generating source in QVC and it has a substantial amount of free cash flow, much of that is going to be devoted to paying down QVC bank debt. There is certainly the restricted payments that can come up and cover interest and the like but how much free cash flow we have to repurchase straight debt, which has been attributed to Liberty Interactive is a little less flexible, so I think where -- our most likely first case is to look at the stuff at LCAPA.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank And then the last question would be on the Starz renewal -- can you just remind us which major Starz renewals are left? And I guess one of the concerns is that renewals won't go well and that will hamper Starz's top line growth. How do renewals with DISH and DIRECTV -- I guess DIRECTV we know -- how did the renewal with DISH go and what’s your anticipation for the remaining, would be helpful. Thanks.  Greg Maffei I’ll just get one thing -- I mean, in scale, the partners that matter the most are DIRECTV first and foremost. That deal is done, renewed for four years. Then Comcast. By scale, Time Warner Cable, though it is the third largest, have never been a particularly strong contributor to premiums -- not just Starz's premiums, anybody’s premiums. So they are well down the list in terms of impact on us and so DISH and Comcast, having done DIRECT, are the big ones and I’ll let Bill comment on this.  Bill Meyers So Comcast, we are in discussions with them right now. We are pretty much in agreement and we are just trying to get that deal papered so we’re getting pretty close. The other deals that are coming up over the next several months are Cox and Time Warner and we have already had preliminary discussions with Cox on what makes sense for them and how they can use our product in a broader sense and those discussions seem to be moving forward in a very positive way.  Other than that, as Greg said, our biggest affiliates are behind us, you know, multiple years --  Greg Maffei And just to tap around that, we did an extension with Cablevision last year and the telcos who are -- [inaudible] -- who are both, you know, they are not enormous today but over hits because of how their growth is and frankly where the rates are, they -- they are both behind us too for a period, so we feel very good about the overall relationship with distributors and where we sit.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Is it fair to say if we aggregate all those deals that we should still expect core rate increases in the CPI plus range? Bill Meyers Well, clearly all those deals have CPI. We continue to add more product, so yes, our goal is to continue to maintain our rate by the addition of incremental product for those folks.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank All right, that’s helpful. Any answer on the cash or should I just --  Greg Maffei Yes, back from the home office --  Chris Shean Got the answer for you -- Starz has $175 million of cash at quarter end. The remaining 443 is corporate and call it other. Of that, 30 is on the RSNs and 30 would go with LEI -- 30 of the corporate cash would go to LEI in the spend, leaving 383 back at Liberty Starz tracker corporate.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank So that’s 548 --  Greg Maffei That excludes the 250 loan.  Chris Shean Yeah, that excludes the short-term loan that was made across the group of 250, so there’s a -- call that a placeholder for temporarily.  Greg Maffei One of the things worth noting, Doug, is we have the financing that was struck to purchase an incremental 78 million shares at Liberty Entertainment that has a collar structure and a loan against it and we are paying down ratably on that at a small clip -- at the close of the deal we’ll be reimbursed for that by DIRECTV but the balance in the interim is being paid down by Liberty Entertainment.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Okay, so if I do all the calculations right including the 250 loan to [inaudible], it sounds like there’s $800 million of cash at quarter end at Starz? Chris Shean If you value the loan as -- treat the loan as cash, yes.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Great. Thanks for all the help.  Operator  Our next question will come from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.  David Gober - Morgan Stanley It is actually Dave Gober. I had a couple for Mike on the QVC business. Obviously a major improvement in the trajectory there and you talked a lot about the cost side but I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper, particularly on the domestic business into the demand side and I’m trying to figure out -- it seemed like both the -- there was an improvement in both units and price but could you drill down a little bit into what the -- whether there was a change in the number of customers or just spending per customers -- I mean, I guess what drove the improvement in demand and what drove the particularly relative to the broader retail market, which did not seem to improve all that much? Mike George I would say it was more spend per customer than necessarily significantly increasing the customer base, so I think what we saw this quarter is we continued to have a very loyal customer who sticks with us. She is clearly more selective in her purchasing than she has been in the past but she is making trade-offs among a multitude of retail outlets, so I think we manage to inspire her a little bit and gained some market share versus the broader retail market. And so for us, to me, it’s really beginning to see -- I think the dividends of things we’ve been working on for the last 18 months, which is to really keep upgrading the quality of our assortments, upgrading the programming, bringing in new brands, and so I just think there was enough newness in the quarter, enough compelling programming and marketing that we were able to push through and get a higher share of her spend. And we are very excited about what we have teed up for the back half. I think that will be stronger still in terms of the quality of the programming and the assortments. We’ll see how the customer responds but we are certainly very excited about it. I generally think it’s the best lineup we’ve ever had.  So we just feel good that we think our initiatives are coming together and presenting a more exciting storefront to the customer and she seems to be responding.  David Gober - Morgan Stanley Great, and then just a follow-up on the gross margin side, it looked like there was a pretty significant improvement from 1Q. HSN had talked a little bit about the fact that they saw an improvement in gross margins because of lower shipping and shipping costs, primarily because of the declining gas prices. Did you guys also see that in the quarter or was it -- was the gross margin improvement more due to mix shift? Mike George For us, it was primarily -- it wasn’t -- the mix issues have continued to be a negative drag on gross margins, so for us it was a combination of a few things. We definitely saw improved freight costs. Given the nature of our contracts, I wouldn’t put that primarily on gas pricing but we did a number of things to better optimize our freight net worth. We really did some creative initiatives that will have long-term benefits in terms of how we distribute our product. That was part of it and part of it was our warehousing costs are part of gross margin and we saw a very nice increase in the productivity in the warehouse. I think we’ve done a much job of variable-izing our labor costs and tying it more tightly to our shipments, along with other initiatives in warehouse. And then part of the improvement reflects the decline in the churn rates and in the relative margins on returns versus the stuff that went out the door and just the mix between returns and original shipments also helped lift product margins.  David Gober - Morgan Stanley Great, and I just had one follow-up on Doug’s question on Starz in terms of the renewals there -- any read through or any change in the structure of most of those deals? I mean, in the past there’s been a mix of fixed rate agreements versus variable. Has that changed in any of the negotiations or do you foresee that changing going forward? Or should the mix be relatively consistent going forward? Greg Maffei For the deals we’ve just completed, they basically have stayed pretty much the same so I don’t project that that mix is going to change significantly. I mean --  Greg Maffei The only thing I would say is if it’s not a change in those deals but frankly the consignment companies have had faster growth than the fixed companies, so in that sense there’s a mix change -- not in the structure of the deals.  Bill Meyers From a structure perspective, we don’t see them moving that much but we are really doing well. If you actually dug in and can see the details of our numbers, we are doing very well with our consignment customers today and we are seeing some softness in the number, it happens to be in some of our fixed rate deals, which our deal structure is protecting us and mitigating some of that risk.  David Gober - Morgan Stanley Makes sense. Great, thanks, guys.  Operator  Our next question will come from Jeffrey Wlodarczak of Hudson Square Research. Jeffrey Wlodarczak - Hudson Square Research Two questions for Greg -- first on the potential swap of Starz Media and Liberty Starz, is the intention to do that fairly quickly after the LEI DTT merger closes? And that’s an internal swap so I assume there’s no tax ratifications.  And then second, any color you can give us on a potential transaction with Time Warner involving AOL and how that could theatrically be structured. Thanks.  Greg Maffei On the first one, we have no current plans to move Starz Media out of Liberty Capital. I think it was noted by Bill -- we have a very consistent growth pattern of earnings which is a -- should appeal to a publics security at Starz Entertainment. Starz Media has -- is in a start-up phase and has a very bumpy pattern, depending on how much P&A and what’s released and the like and it sits today inside Liberty Capital, which is really an asset company, not an earnings driven company, not an EBITDA growth story the way that we believe Liberty Starz is.  So I think one of the questions is how is it best configured and over the long-term, how do we grow that business at Starz Media and then at some point, does it make sense to combine more with Starz Entertainment. But I don’t think that stands today as the right strategy.  Secondly, we have a lot of basis in that to actually -- how we structure that, we might actually not want to have it be a tax free deal. We’ll see what time holds.  On an AOL deal, as I think I was asked before, we have a productive relationship with Time Warner. We’ve already done one 355 exchange with them. We hold a bunch, around $800 million of TWX stock today. If there were an asset that were attractive that they were a seller of, we would certainly want to look. AOL could be that but could be something else too. AOL in particular might have some tax attributes -- they are attractive as well as being an interesting story.  Jeffrey Wlodarczak - Hudson Square Research Thanks. If I could ask one follow-up -- as much as you can, can you shed any light on the delay in getting the LEI DTV proxy approved to the SEC? Because I think you were supposed to get approval by today or you have to drop in new numbers -- [I think that’s the case]. Greg Maffei There are two things there. One is just negotiating with them about the structure of the transaction. At some point, the numbers go stale. So the time passed when working through the proxy we did go to the stale numbers and needed to drop the new ones in, so that is -- there are in effect two sets of delays, right? It took longer to get the discussion done with them and then once it took longer, kicked into needing new numbers.  Plus it’s as complicated as there’s two proxy statements that are having to get processed through the SEC.  Jeffrey Wlodarczak - Hudson Square Research Thanks very much.  Operator  Our next question will come from Douglas Anmuth from Barclays Capital. Douglas Anmuth - Barclays Capital Thanks for taking the question. A couple of things for Mike -- first I just wanted to follow-up on the return rate, which I think at 17.3% was the lowest it’s been in several quarters. Can you talk more about the key drivers here beyond just the sales mix? You mentioned some other initiatives here and I’m curious about the sustainability going forward.  And then also, if you could comment on the linearity of the quarter in the U.S. and the international markets and perhaps what you are seeing here early in 3Q? Thanks.  Mike George Sure. On the return rates, I would say that the mix was a large driver, as we shift mix more to electronics, beauty, home categories, which all have a much lower return rate than jewelry. We are also very focused on a corporate wide initiative to continue to strengthen product satisfaction and quality. We think it’s already quite high but we are trying to take it another level beyond that and there’s a variety of initiatives in that, everything from working on apparel sizing and education to improving jewelry, quality, a number of things I won't go through all the details but we do think that will yield benefits over time.  Now I’d also tell you that to some extent, the [green] improvement in this quarter is a little overstated versus sort of what the underlying business because as you know, part of the way you do returns is you are trying to estimate what returns are going to be going forward, since people have months to return the items and you are making estimates. And so a little bit of this is also kind of just a truing up of estimates, I think somewhat exaggerated to the degree of improvement. But nonetheless, we do think the improvement is real and we would expect to see continued improvements in returns going forward as we look at the mix of business as well as these quality initiatives, our expectation is we will see good [guys] in returns going forward.  In terms of commenting on Q3, we don’t -- you know, our policy is not to comment on in-quarter results. Obviously we saw in most markets very healthy sequential improvements between Q2 and Q1, so we feel good about the momentum. We feel good about the product mix and of course we are also coming into much easier comparisons and that obviously helps on the margin, to be comparing against softer numbers in the back half of last year.  Douglas Anmuth - Barclays Capital Okay, great. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question will come from Bridget Washa of J.P. Morgan. Bridget Washa - J.P. Morgan A quick question on Liberty Interactive -- earlier you said most of the growth was coming from existing customers spend more, which I believe has been a trend over the last couple of years. At some point though you are going to need to seed the funnel with new customers and now it seems like you have great opportunities with so many businesses having gone bankrupt. What are you doing to drive new customer acquisition growth? And then the second question is I know you said earlier that you were pushing back many of the costs associated with QVC Italy into 2010. Can you give us anymore detail about when you expect to recognize costs and about how much? Thank you.  Mike George On the new customer front, we do think we have a lot of opportunities to grow the customer base. And as we’ve discussed in prior calls and meetings, we focus less on the absolute count of new customers and more focused on quality of customers, so we are kind of very surgical right now about looking at those businesses, those categories that tend to attract new customers that are highly profitable customers who are likely to be loyal to QVC and continue to invest in those kinds of businesses and continue to invest in creative marketing initiatives, platform initiatives to reach them.  So for example, this major partnership with Isaac Mizrahi who has a very devoted following, who had extraordinary success when he decided to go to Target and make his aspirational products available there. He obviously exited Target a while back. We think there’s a whole lot of folks that know Isaac and will be excited about the things he is going to do for us which we think are truly breakthrough and we see that as a great way to get new customers.  We are launching a very exciting accessories product line with Rachel Zoe in September. She has a very hot reality series on Bravo. She’s one of the leading stylists in the country. We think that that Bravo audience will be excited to see what we are up to.  I’ll give you a real, kind of immediate example but it just reflects the kinds of things we are trying to do -- on Sunday, if you tune into VH1, you will see a simulcast of QVC on VH1 as we lead the market in launching the remastered Beatles catalog, as well as Beatles for Rock Band. Really exciting, really fun, I think we’ll get a lot of new customers on our channel but we’ll get a whole VH1 audience that probably isn’t buying at QVC right now to see what we are up to.  We are really focused on social media, continue to do more and more with Facebook and Twitter in particular and we think that’s extending the word of mouth. And so for us, it’s about having the kinds of categories that appeal to new customers, whether that’s entertainment or beauty and it’s about being creative about how to get our word out on other platforms, whether it’s the VH1 example or social networks and we have a number of initiatives like that in the works.  Greg Maffei I would add -- I think that those are all excellent initiatives. In addition, we have had a case where every few years we had been introducing an international, new international subsidiary and there’s been a delay. Italy will kick in, Mike’s going to talk about the costs but in effect adding a new younger mix of business, not necessarily -- I know you were focused probably on within each business but adding a new one is a good growth perspective on new customers as well because you want to have ones which have not yet reached scale entering into the funnel and so we talked about Italy. Obviously we’ve also talked about trying [new things] in places like China. I think that’s going to be an important part of the initiative for growth going forward at QVC.  Mike George And on the Italy launch, we are beginning to ramp up. We expect that most of the costs, as you mentioned, will start to kick in next year. We’ll have modest costs throughout this year as we begin to add staff and build out the facility and so forth. But they will be immaterial in the scheme of things.  I don’t know that we are prepared right now to talk about a next year number. You can certainly get insight by looking at the year one launch in Japan, which is our most recent market and what kind of EBITDA or what kind of expense hit we took in year one. And I would tell you that we don’t expect it to be all that meaningful on the total EBITDA base of the company, so we don’t see it as something that’s going to have a material impact on the total EBITDA delivered in 2010.  Bridget Washa - J.P. Morgan Great. Thank you so much.  Operator  Our next question will come from James Ratcliffe of Barclays Capital. James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital  A couple of questions -- first of all on -- looking forward to 2010 for Starz, given what you’ve been seeing in terms of box office performance from your studio providers, any read on what we are likely to see in terms of programming cost growth? And secondly just are -- should we still be assuming that you will have to pay out cash taxes when the Sprint hedges mature? Bill Meyers Well, 2010 is a little hard to look at right now because we still have a lot of titles that haven’t been released, so it’s hard for me to give you kind of a view of that is. We need to wait a couple of more months to just see where we’re at on those.  Greg Maffei And as you know, James, it’s not only the scale of the titles, it’s the number of the titles and so if certain things ship during the quarter, Q3 or slip past Q4 into 2010 will impact, so there’s a bunch of variables.  Bill Meyers So it’s a little bit early right now to kind of have a view of that.  Greg Maffei And on the Sprint collar, our hope is that we would defer that tax.  James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital  Right. Thank you.  Greg Maffei That’s our expectation.  James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital  Your expectation? Greg Maffei Yes.  James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital  Okay, thanks.  Operator  Our next question will come from Matthew Harrigan of Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Good morning. First of all, as far as Overture goes, you’ve really got a lot of open playing field now, given everything that has happened in the private equity side, the film financing, et cetera. I know the exhibitors are clamoring for more product. Is that something that just makes Chris [McGurk’s] like a little bit easier or is that something that is really funneling into your business plan at this point, given that there’s a bit of a gap there.  And then secondly on the GSN and fun technology side, I mean, those businesses are subject to a lot of the network effects that Michael [Zisner] likes to talk about and they really helped your e-commerce businesses. I know that you are trying to graft on to QVC. Can you talk a little bit about those businesses? I mean, it seems like they are -- or GSM, it seems like it is going to get a little bit lost over DIRECTV, I mean -- and in hindsight, is that something that you almost regret moving over there, given that it has a pretty nice growth opportunity to -- that and fun? Greg Maffei Sure. So on Overture, I think obviously there are a bunch of factors you noted. The changes in the film financing market and the like which help any entrant in the film business. There are also a bunch of factors to make the film business harder these days and probably the most prominent of which is the decline of DVD, particularly anything where you have library if it doesn’t hit it initially out of the blocks closer to the day-in-date drop, it’s really not hanging well. And a lot of things that have gone on structurally in the channel -- the absence of bins at Walmart and the like, all those things have reduced the DVD market post the initial drop.  When you look at that market overall, Overture has got a bunch of advantages because of Starz and where it is playing and it’s got a bunch of challenges and I think you’ve seen that candidly in the first year’s release as you try and get up to scale. It hasn’t necessarily delivered on as much as we would like. On the other hand, it has had some successes and I think if we look at the lineup ahead, there is reason to be optimistic.  I would also say we have a plant there in terms of our Anchor Bay distribution, our theatrical distribution at Overture, and the ability to take in the pay slot at Starz, which is probably under-utilized and one of our goals in 2010 will be put more product through there. One way or another, not necessarily all of which is ours but which we can partner with and probably take less risk of it, fulfill potential in the plant.  At GSN Fun, we are very sad to see it go because it’s a great business. It certainly had its challenges on the GSN side and the overall advertising market right now. Ratings are pretty good. They’ve done some really innovative stuff, David Goldsville and his team, on the programming side and that’s just getting up to speed but they are still exposed to the overall ad market, you know, general ad market and they have a lot of DR, which may be a little less vulnerable but they still have challenges.  On the Internet side, they have grown considerably and will and we love that business and what they are doing and I think they are right to note the potential for network effects. The hope would be and the expectation would be since our shareholders will be a significant majority percentage of the -- and in fact the majority of the shares at DIRECTV that DIRECTV can take that asset and drive it even further than we could using some of its distribution strength.  Matthew Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Thank you.  Operator  Our final question will come from Murray Arenson of Janco Partners. Murray Arenson - Janco Partners Thanks. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on what Matt was asking on the production side -- if you could talk a little bit more maybe with respect to the original series and give us the context for what budgets look like there and timing of that. I am particularly interested in the Spartacus piece, since that sounds like kind of movie product quality.  And then secondly if Greg, you could just offer some more color on the tax sharing payments that were referenced relative to Liberty Capital? Greg Maffei Let me if I could talk a little bit about the original series first and let Bill and anyone else fill in -- I think one of the things that has had some beginning critical success with Crash, the back half of Crash, how it did through the back half of its first season and how Party Down has done is we’ve had some critical success but have not actually driven as much audience yet as we would like. And this is a learning process and it is a process that took HBO probably 10 years. We hope not to be quite as long in the learning style but I think Spartacus in particular is going to have impact and someone described it as Gladiator meets 300, but you might be able to throw in meets Caligula. It’s going to be very graphic in a lot of fashion, both violence and sex and I think it’s going to open a lot of eyes. There are a lot of Lucy Lawless fans who are going to be very excited to see the series just for that.  And I think it will have impact and it’s a great learning experience and I think it will be very well-received. And those original series are an important part of creating the right mix of movies and originals at Starz, which I give credit to the team for doing.  Do you want to comment on the cost side, or anything else? Bill Meyers I think your point that Spartacus looks a lot more like movie kind of quality, clearly we have pushed ourselves to take account of a product that we really like and a story that we really like and put the best product on the screen and Rob Tappert and Sam Raimi are great at that. You know, the cost of that is kind of on -- you know, consistent with what you would see with a lot of original dramas on kind of that $2 million to $3 million an episode type of world. And we are very pleased with that product. As Greg said, it is getting a lot of publicity right now and notoriety. Lucy Lawless has a great following. At ComicCon, we couldn’t keep enough -- we didn’t have enough room as she was there and we think it’s a great story. And that’s what we have been trying to do is put really high quality stories with the best product we can put on the screen for the money and really drive customers. And it’s -- you know, we’ve come a long ways in two years. I’m with Greg -- I hope it’s not a 10-year, 12-year event but we are very pleased with it and it’s coming out in January, so --  Greg Maffei The e-water cooler buzz about Spartacus is enormous.  Bill Meyers And not just domestically -- it’s also international. I mean, we had several of the big broadcasters in the international market who already are interested in buying it just off the trailer, so we know we have the right story and it’s something that you have not seen on TV before and we are very pleased with it.  Greg Maffei  And obviously you must be a Lucy Lawless fan, asking that. Maybe you could help me understand exactly the nature of the tax question LCAPA because I am not sure I followed you.  Murray Arenson - Janco Partners Well, I was just referencing in the press release the tax sharing payments between the -- the inter-group tax sharing payments? Chris Shean I can handle this -- Liberty Capital of course is the provider of tax shelter to the other two groups who generate taxable income, and for the six months the interactive group paid $138 million to capital and the entertainment group paid $117 million. So a total of $255 million of cash going back to capital for their tax shelter.  Greg Maffei So in effect, rather than pay the U.S. government, the shelter is created by Capital, Interactive and Entertainment pay Capital and any future liability becomes Capital’s.  Murray Arenson - Janco Partners Understood. Excellent. Thank you.  Greg Maffei Thank you very much for joining us this morning and again for your continued interest in Liberty and thank you to all the participants.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Jason Bazinet of Citi. Jason Bazinet - Citigroup I have a quick question on Liberty Capital. When I do my back-of-the-envelope calculation, it seems like the valuation makes sense if you don’t include any equity for the Sirius stake that you have and it seems to not make sense if you include it, and so I was just wondering --  Greg Maffei -- say, Jason, when I’m not sure I agree with the premise of your question because I might think that there’s value in Liberty Capital even without the SIRIUS XM equity attribution, but go ahead with that point. Sorry.  Jason Bazinet - Citigroup And so my question is can you just sort of help investors sort of understand how you might help Sirius to the extent they need financing and how valuable that asset and our NOLs are to you if it does go bankrupt? In other words, it’s not -- it seems to me the market should be included and I’m a little mystified why they aren’t because I guess my hypothesis, you sort of have an incentive to sort of make sure that Sirius remains a viable entity. Any comments would be helpful. Thanks.  Greg Maffei Sure. I think when we struck the SIRIUS XM deal, Dave Flower our Treasurer said to me this is either a bottom or -- because you don’t put senior debt in at a $1 billion valuation and get 40% of the equity, or we’re just -- you know, it’s a fraud and we’ve just missed it. And we’re obviously convinced that was a bottom and the result of SIRIUS XM since have seen to demonstrate that. I believe at the time they were talking about 300 of EBITDA and the market didn’t believe it. Then they talked about 350 of EBITDA as they reported Q1. Now they reported Q2 and they have raised their numbers I believe to 400 of EBITDA and frankly, I don’t think I am underselling Mel here when I tell you I think they are going to significantly exceed 400 million of EBITDA. So I am very comfortable that our debt there is money good and that the equity valuation, while one can argue about how aggressive it is on a multiple basis, you’d be hard pressed to find a [stale] media company out there growing at the rates that this company is growing this year and I believe will grow over the next couple or three years without much improvement if any in the auto market.  Cost savings around content, around OEM deals, around the merger and production and operating costs are driving that growth and will and as our Chairman likes to say, if the auto market comes back stronger than we are anticipating, forget cash for clunkers but over the next couple of years, that’s a lucky strike extra.  So I am very comfortable talking about things like what might happen in a bankruptcy and how we might be able to capture the NOLs -- those are all ideas that we might have had back in February and March but those are very distant ideas today and we are talking about how much this equity is worth.  So I think this is a great business. They are unfortunately refinancing -- did refinance and I suspect will refinance more of the senior debt that we bought. The good news, they will take our money off the table and validate the equity story and lower their cost of capital. The bad news is we were getting very high rates of interest paid to us on that senior debt and we will no longer be collecting that. So we have mixed motivations on that.  Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Understood. Very helpful. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question will come from Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Thanks very much. Just a few detail questions -- one, Greg, are you able to tell us what the cash balance was between Starz and LEI it was at quarter end and tying out to what was on the balance sheet? Greg Maffei Sorry, Doug, let me make sure I understand this -- you’re saying what was in Liberty Entertainment, how much will end up at Liberty Starz and how much will end up at LEI? Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Yes, in aggregate --  [Multiple Speakers] Greg Maffei Okay, let me let my able folks in the room do some calculating, make sure we get that right for you. We’ll come back to that one. Keep going.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank The second one, you talked about selling shares at Sprint and [Moat]. Is that done? Are you fully sold out of those positions and what does that do with regard to the impact on the derivatives you have and the borrowing and any potential tax liability there would be helpful.  Greg Maffei I don’t think we’re disclosing whether we’ve sold those out just because we don’t want to create any overhand in the marketplace on that but it’s safe to say we are at the right price. We’re happy to be sellers of those assets and we don’t believe it has any impact on the underlying derivatives in our tax position.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank And then you talked about an interest in repurchasing more of your debt over the coming quarters. Is the thought there -- could you be anymore specific? Is this an LCAPA specific event since that seems to be where it is sourced in terms of open market purchases or tenders or any additional details there? Greg Maffei Well, if you look at the debt we have post a spin merge with DIRECTV, there will be no debt at Liberty Starz -- it only has cash and excluding the fees debt at LCAPA because when I talk about the fees, I am talking about the Sprint callers which are offset by the Sprint borrowing. That’s really neutral.  You know, we have those exchangeables which we’re trading at a discount and at the right time and place, we valuating our investment opportunities in Liberty Capital, we’ll look at whether we’ll purchase third party investments or we’re purchasing debt or equity, which of those three is the most attractive. So that’s certainly possible.  Liberty Interactive is a little tougher. It does not have -- while it has a great cash flow generating source in QVC and it has a substantial amount of free cash flow, much of that is going to be devoted to paying down QVC bank debt. There is certainly the restricted payments that can come up and cover interest and the like but how much free cash flow we have to repurchase straight debt, which has been attributed to Liberty Interactive is a little less flexible, so I think where -- our most likely first case is to look at the stuff at LCAPA.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank And then the last question would be on the Starz renewal -- can you just remind us which major Starz renewals are left? And I guess one of the concerns is that renewals won't go well and that will hamper Starz's top line growth. How do renewals with DISH and DIRECTV -- I guess DIRECTV we know -- how did the renewal with DISH go and what’s your anticipation for the remaining, would be helpful. Thanks.  Greg Maffei I’ll just get one thing -- I mean, in scale, the partners that matter the most are DIRECTV first and foremost. That deal is done, renewed for four years. Then Comcast. By scale, Time Warner Cable, though it is the third largest, have never been a particularly strong contributor to premiums -- not just Starz's premiums, anybody’s premiums. So they are well down the list in terms of impact on us and so DISH and Comcast, having done DIRECT, are the big ones and I’ll let Bill comment on this.  Bill Meyers So Comcast, we are in discussions with them right now. We are pretty much in agreement and we are just trying to get that deal papered so we’re getting pretty close. The other deals that are coming up over the next several months are Cox and Time Warner and we have already had preliminary discussions with Cox on what makes sense for them and how they can use our product in a broader sense and those discussions seem to be moving forward in a very positive way.  Other than that, as Greg said, our biggest affiliates are behind us, you know, multiple years --  Greg Maffei And just to tap around that, we did an extension with Cablevision last year and the telcos who are -- [inaudible] -- who are both, you know, they are not enormous today but over hits because of how their growth is and frankly where the rates are, they -- they are both behind us too for a period, so we feel very good about the overall relationship with distributors and where we sit.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Is it fair to say if we aggregate all those deals that we should still expect core rate increases in the CPI plus range? Bill Meyers Well, clearly all those deals have CPI. We continue to add more product, so yes, our goal is to continue to maintain our rate by the addition of incremental product for those folks.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank All right, that’s helpful. Any answer on the cash or should I just --  Greg Maffei Yes, back from the home office --  Chris Shean Got the answer for you -- Starz has $175 million of cash at quarter end. The remaining 443 is corporate and call it other. Of that, 30 is on the RSNs and 30 would go with LEI -- 30 of the corporate cash would go to LEI in the spend, leaving 383 back at Liberty Starz tracker corporate.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank So that’s 548 --  Greg Maffei That excludes the 250 loan.  Chris Shean Yeah, that excludes the short-term loan that was made across the group of 250, so there’s a -- call that a placeholder for temporarily.  Greg Maffei One of the things worth noting, Doug, is we have the financing that was struck to purchase an incremental 78 million shares at Liberty Entertainment that has a collar structure and a loan against it and we are paying down ratably on that at a small clip -- at the close of the deal we’ll be reimbursed for that by DIRECTV but the balance in the interim is being paid down by Liberty Entertainment.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Okay, so if I do all the calculations right including the 250 loan to [inaudible], it sounds like there’s $800 million of cash at quarter end at Starz? Chris Shean If you value the loan as -- treat the loan as cash, yes.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Great. Thanks for all the help.  Operator  Our next question will come from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.  David Gober - Morgan Stanley It is actually Dave Gober. I had a couple for Mike on the QVC business. Obviously a major improvement in the trajectory there and you talked a lot about the cost side but I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper, particularly on the domestic business into the demand side and I’m trying to figure out -- it seemed like both the -- there was an improvement in both units and price but could you drill down a little bit into what the -- whether there was a change in the number of customers or just spending per customers -- I mean, I guess what drove the improvement in demand and what drove the particularly relative to the broader retail market, which did not seem to improve all that much? Mike George I would say it was more spend per customer than necessarily significantly increasing the customer base, so I think what we saw this quarter is we continued to have a very loyal customer who sticks with us. She is clearly more selective in her purchasing than she has been in the past but she is making trade-offs among a multitude of retail outlets, so I think we manage to inspire her a little bit and gained some market share versus the broader retail market. And so for us, to me, it’s really beginning to see -- I think the dividends of things we’ve been working on for the last 18 months, which is to really keep upgrading the quality of our assortments, upgrading the programming, bringing in new brands, and so I just think there was enough newness in the quarter, enough compelling programming and marketing that we were able to push through and get a higher share of her spend. And we are very excited about what we have teed up for the back half. I think that will be stronger still in terms of the quality of the programming and the assortments. We’ll see how the customer responds but we are certainly very excited about it. I generally think it’s the best lineup we’ve ever had.  So we just feel good that we think our initiatives are coming together and presenting a more exciting storefront to the customer and she seems to be responding.  David Gober - Morgan Stanley Great, and then just a follow-up on the gross margin side, it looked like there was a pretty significant improvement from 1Q. HSN had talked a little bit about the fact that they saw an improvement in gross margins because of lower shipping and shipping costs, primarily because of the declining gas prices. Did you guys also see that in the quarter or was it -- was the gross margin improvement more due to mix shift? Mike George For us, it was primarily -- it wasn’t -- the mix issues have continued to be a negative drag on gross margins, so for us it was a combination of a few things. We definitely saw improved freight costs. Given the nature of our contracts, I wouldn’t put that primarily on gas pricing but we did a number of things to better optimize our freight net worth. We really did some creative initiatives that will have long-term benefits in terms of how we distribute our product. That was part of it and part of it was our warehousing costs are part of gross margin and we saw a very nice increase in the productivity in the warehouse. I think we’ve done a much job of variable-izing our labor costs and tying it more tightly to our shipments, along with other initiatives in warehouse. And then part of the improvement reflects the decline in the churn rates and in the relative margins on returns versus the stuff that went out the door and just the mix between returns and original shipments also helped lift product margins.  David Gober - Morgan Stanley Great, and I just had one follow-up on Doug’s question on Starz in terms of the renewals there -- any read through or any change in the structure of most of those deals? I mean, in the past there’s been a mix of fixed rate agreements versus variable. Has that changed in any of the negotiations or do you foresee that changing going forward? Or should the mix be relatively consistent going forward? Greg Maffei For the deals we’ve just completed, they basically have stayed pretty much the same so I don’t project that that mix is going to change significantly. I mean --  Greg Maffei The only thing I would say is if it’s not a change in those deals but frankly the consignment companies have had faster growth than the fixed companies, so in that sense there’s a mix change -- not in the structure of the deals.  Bill Meyers From a structure perspective, we don’t see them moving that much but we are really doing well. If you actually dug in and can see the details of our numbers, we are doing very well with our consignment customers today and we are seeing some softness in the number, it happens to be in some of our fixed rate deals, which our deal structure is protecting us and mitigating some of that risk.  David Gober - Morgan Stanley Makes sense. Great, thanks, guys.  Operator  Our next question will come from Jeffrey Wlodarczak of Hudson Square Research. Jeffrey Wlodarczak - Hudson Square Research Two questions for Greg -- first on the potential swap of Starz Media and Liberty Starz, is the intention to do that fairly quickly after the LEI DTT merger closes? And that’s an internal swap so I assume there’s no tax ratifications.  And then second, any color you can give us on a potential transaction with Time Warner involving AOL and how that could theatrically be structured. Thanks.  Greg Maffei On the first one, we have no current plans to move Starz Media out of Liberty Capital. I think it was noted by Bill -- we have a very consistent growth pattern of earnings which is a -- should appeal to a publics security at Starz Entertainment. Starz Media has -- is in a start-up phase and has a very bumpy pattern, depending on how much P&A and what’s released and the like and it sits today inside Liberty Capital, which is really an asset company, not an earnings driven company, not an EBITDA growth story the way that we believe Liberty Starz is.  So I think one of the questions is how is it best configured and over the long-term, how do we grow that business at Starz Media and then at some point, does it make sense to combine more with Starz Entertainment. But I don’t think that stands today as the right strategy.  Secondly, we have a lot of basis in that to actually -- how we structure that, we might actually not want to have it be a tax free deal. We’ll see what time holds.  On an AOL deal, as I think I was asked before, we have a productive relationship with Time Warner. We’ve already done one 355 exchange with them. We hold a bunch, around $800 million of TWX stock today. If there were an asset that were attractive that they were a seller of, we would certainly want to look. AOL could be that but could be something else too. AOL in particular might have some tax attributes -- they are attractive as well as being an interesting story.  Jeffrey Wlodarczak - Hudson Square Research Thanks. If I could ask one follow-up -- as much as you can, can you shed any light on the delay in getting the LEI DTV proxy approved to the SEC? Because I think you were supposed to get approval by today or you have to drop in new numbers -- [I think that’s the case]. Greg Maffei There are two things there. One is just negotiating with them about the structure of the transaction. At some point, the numbers go stale. So the time passed when working through the proxy we did go to the stale numbers and needed to drop the new ones in, so that is -- there are in effect two sets of delays, right? It took longer to get the discussion done with them and then once it took longer, kicked into needing new numbers.  Plus it’s as complicated as there’s two proxy statements that are having to get processed through the SEC.  Jeffrey Wlodarczak - Hudson Square Research Thanks very much.  Operator  Our next question will come from Douglas Anmuth from Barclays Capital. Douglas Anmuth - Barclays Capital Thanks for taking the question. A couple of things for Mike -- first I just wanted to follow-up on the return rate, which I think at 17.3% was the lowest it’s been in several quarters. Can you talk more about the key drivers here beyond just the sales mix? You mentioned some other initiatives here and I’m curious about the sustainability going forward.  And then also, if you could comment on the linearity of the quarter in the U.S. and the international markets and perhaps what you are seeing here early in 3Q? Thanks.  Mike George Sure. On the return rates, I would say that the mix was a large driver, as we shift mix more to electronics, beauty, home categories, which all have a much lower return rate than jewelry. We are also very focused on a corporate wide initiative to continue to strengthen product satisfaction and quality. We think it’s already quite high but we are trying to take it another level beyond that and there’s a variety of initiatives in that, everything from working on apparel sizing and education to improving jewelry, quality, a number of things I won't go through all the details but we do think that will yield benefits over time.  Now I’d also tell you that to some extent, the [green] improvement in this quarter is a little overstated versus sort of what the underlying business because as you know, part of the way you do returns is you are trying to estimate what returns are going to be going forward, since people have months to return the items and you are making estimates. And so a little bit of this is also kind of just a truing up of estimates, I think somewhat exaggerated to the degree of improvement. But nonetheless, we do think the improvement is real and we would expect to see continued improvements in returns going forward as we look at the mix of business as well as these quality initiatives, our expectation is we will see good [guys] in returns going forward.  In terms of commenting on Q3, we don’t -- you know, our policy is not to comment on in-quarter results. Obviously we saw in most markets very healthy sequential improvements between Q2 and Q1, so we feel good about the momentum. We feel good about the product mix and of course we are also coming into much easier comparisons and that obviously helps on the margin, to be comparing against softer numbers in the back half of last year.  Douglas Anmuth - Barclays Capital Okay, great. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question will come from Bridget Washa of J.P. Morgan. Bridget Washa - J.P. Morgan A quick question on Liberty Interactive -- earlier you said most of the growth was coming from existing customers spend more, which I believe has been a trend over the last couple of years. At some point though you are going to need to seed the funnel with new customers and now it seems like you have great opportunities with so many businesses having gone bankrupt. What are you doing to drive new customer acquisition growth? And then the second question is I know you said earlier that you were pushing back many of the costs associated with QVC Italy into 2010. Can you give us anymore detail about when you expect to recognize costs and about how much? Thank you.  Mike George On the new customer front, we do think we have a lot of opportunities to grow the customer base. And as we’ve discussed in prior calls and meetings, we focus less on the absolute count of new customers and more focused on quality of customers, so we are kind of very surgical right now about looking at those businesses, those categories that tend to attract new customers that are highly profitable customers who are likely to be loyal to QVC and continue to invest in those kinds of businesses and continue to invest in creative marketing initiatives, platform initiatives to reach them.  So for example, this major partnership with Isaac Mizrahi who has a very devoted following, who had extraordinary success when he decided to go to Target and make his aspirational products available there. He obviously exited Target a while back. We think there’s a whole lot of folks that know Isaac and will be excited about the things he is going to do for us which we think are truly breakthrough and we see that as a great way to get new customers.  We are launching a very exciting accessories product line with Rachel Zoe in September. She has a very hot reality series on Bravo. She’s one of the leading stylists in the country. We think that that Bravo audience will be excited to see what we are up to.  I’ll give you a real, kind of immediate example but it just reflects the kinds of things we are trying to do -- on Sunday, if you tune into VH1, you will see a simulcast of QVC on VH1 as we lead the market in launching the remastered Beatles catalog, as well as Beatles for Rock Band. Really exciting, really fun, I think we’ll get a lot of new customers on our channel but we’ll get a whole VH1 audience that probably isn’t buying at QVC right now to see what we are up to.  We are really focused on social media, continue to do more and more with Facebook and Twitter in particular and we think that’s extending the word of mouth. And so for us, it’s about having the kinds of categories that appeal to new customers, whether that’s entertainment or beauty and it’s about being creative about how to get our word out on other platforms, whether it’s the VH1 example or social networks and we have a number of initiatives like that in the works.  Greg Maffei I would add -- I think that those are all excellent initiatives. In addition, we have had a case where every few years we had been introducing an international, new international subsidiary and there’s been a delay. Italy will kick in, Mike’s going to talk about the costs but in effect adding a new younger mix of business, not necessarily -- I know you were focused probably on within each business but adding a new one is a good growth perspective on new customers as well because you want to have ones which have not yet reached scale entering into the funnel and so we talked about Italy. Obviously we’ve also talked about trying [new things] in places like China. I think that’s going to be an important part of the initiative for growth going forward at QVC.  Mike George And on the Italy launch, we are beginning to ramp up. We expect that most of the costs, as you mentioned, will start to kick in next year. We’ll have modest costs throughout this year as we begin to add staff and build out the facility and so forth. But they will be immaterial in the scheme of things.  I don’t know that we are prepared right now to talk about a next year number. You can certainly get insight by looking at the year one launch in Japan, which is our most recent market and what kind of EBITDA or what kind of expense hit we took in year one. And I would tell you that we don’t expect it to be all that meaningful on the total EBITDA base of the company, so we don’t see it as something that’s going to have a material impact on the total EBITDA delivered in 2010.  Bridget Washa - J.P. Morgan Great. Thank you so much.  Operator  Our next question will come from James Ratcliffe of Barclays Capital. James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital  A couple of questions -- first of all on -- looking forward to 2010 for Starz, given what you’ve been seeing in terms of box office performance from your studio providers, any read on what we are likely to see in terms of programming cost growth? And secondly just are -- should we still be assuming that you will have to pay out cash taxes when the Sprint hedges mature? Bill Meyers Well, 2010 is a little hard to look at right now because we still have a lot of titles that haven’t been released, so it’s hard for me to give you kind of a view of that is. We need to wait a couple of more months to just see where we’re at on those.  Greg Maffei And as you know, James, it’s not only the scale of the titles, it’s the number of the titles and so if certain things ship during the quarter, Q3 or slip past Q4 into 2010 will impact, so there’s a bunch of variables.  Bill Meyers So it’s a little bit early right now to kind of have a view of that.  Greg Maffei And on the Sprint collar, our hope is that we would defer that tax.  James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital  Right. Thank you.  Greg Maffei That’s our expectation.  James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital  Your expectation? Greg Maffei Yes.  James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital  Okay, thanks.  Operator  Our next question will come from Matthew Harrigan of Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Good morning. First of all, as far as Overture goes, you’ve really got a lot of open playing field now, given everything that has happened in the private equity side, the film financing, et cetera. I know the exhibitors are clamoring for more product. Is that something that just makes Chris [McGurk’s] like a little bit easier or is that something that is really funneling into your business plan at this point, given that there’s a bit of a gap there.  And then secondly on the GSN and fun technology side, I mean, those businesses are subject to a lot of the network effects that Michael [Zisner] likes to talk about and they really helped your e-commerce businesses. I know that you are trying to graft on to QVC. Can you talk a little bit about those businesses? I mean, it seems like they are -- or GSM, it seems like it is going to get a little bit lost over DIRECTV, I mean -- and in hindsight, is that something that you almost regret moving over there, given that it has a pretty nice growth opportunity to -- that and fun? Greg Maffei Sure. So on Overture, I think obviously there are a bunch of factors you noted. The changes in the film financing market and the like which help any entrant in the film business. There are also a bunch of factors to make the film business harder these days and probably the most prominent of which is the decline of DVD, particularly anything where you have library if it doesn’t hit it initially out of the blocks closer to the day-in-date drop, it’s really not hanging well. And a lot of things that have gone on structurally in the channel -- the absence of bins at Walmart and the like, all those things have reduced the DVD market post the initial drop.  When you look at that market overall, Overture has got a bunch of advantages because of Starz and where it is playing and it’s got a bunch of challenges and I think you’ve seen that candidly in the first year’s release as you try and get up to scale. It hasn’t necessarily delivered on as much as we would like. On the other hand, it has had some successes and I think if we look at the lineup ahead, there is reason to be optimistic.  I would also say we have a plant there in terms of our Anchor Bay distribution, our theatrical distribution at Overture, and the ability to take in the pay slot at Starz, which is probably under-utilized and one of our goals in 2010 will be put more product through there. One way or another, not necessarily all of which is ours but which we can partner with and probably take less risk of it, fulfill potential in the plant.  At GSN Fun, we are very sad to see it go because it’s a great business. It certainly had its challenges on the GSN side and the overall advertising market right now. Ratings are pretty good. They’ve done some really innovative stuff, David Goldsville and his team, on the programming side and that’s just getting up to speed but they are still exposed to the overall ad market, you know, general ad market and they have a lot of DR, which may be a little less vulnerable but they still have challenges.  On the Internet side, they have grown considerably and will and we love that business and what they are doing and I think they are right to note the potential for network effects. The hope would be and the expectation would be since our shareholders will be a significant majority percentage of the -- and in fact the majority of the shares at DIRECTV that DIRECTV can take that asset and drive it even further than we could using some of its distribution strength.  Matthew Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Thank you.  Operator  Our final question will come from Murray Arenson of Janco Partners. Murray Arenson - Janco Partners Thanks. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on what Matt was asking on the production side -- if you could talk a little bit more maybe with respect to the original series and give us the context for what budgets look like there and timing of that. I am particularly interested in the Spartacus piece, since that sounds like kind of movie product quality.  And then secondly if Greg, you could just offer some more color on the tax sharing payments that were referenced relative to Liberty Capital? Greg Maffei Let me if I could talk a little bit about the original series first and let Bill and anyone else fill in -- I think one of the things that has had some beginning critical success with Crash, the back half of Crash, how it did through the back half of its first season and how Party Down has done is we’ve had some critical success but have not actually driven as much audience yet as we would like. And this is a learning process and it is a process that took HBO probably 10 years. We hope not to be quite as long in the learning style but I think Spartacus in particular is going to have impact and someone described it as Gladiator meets 300, but you might be able to throw in meets Caligula. It’s going to be very graphic in a lot of fashion, both violence and sex and I think it’s going to open a lot of eyes. There are a lot of Lucy Lawless fans who are going to be very excited to see the series just for that.  And I think it will have impact and it’s a great learning experience and I think it will be very well-received. And those original series are an important part of creating the right mix of movies and originals at Starz, which I give credit to the team for doing.  Do you want to comment on the cost side, or anything else? Bill Meyers I think your point that Spartacus looks a lot more like movie kind of quality, clearly we have pushed ourselves to take account of a product that we really like and a story that we really like and put the best product on the screen and Rob Tappert and Sam Raimi are great at that. You know, the cost of that is kind of on -- you know, consistent with what you would see with a lot of original dramas on kind of that $2 million to $3 million an episode type of world. And we are very pleased with that product. As Greg said, it is getting a lot of publicity right now and notoriety. Lucy Lawless has a great following. At ComicCon, we couldn’t keep enough -- we didn’t have enough room as she was there and we think it’s a great story. And that’s what we have been trying to do is put really high quality stories with the best product we can put on the screen for the money and really drive customers. And it’s -- you know, we’ve come a long ways in two years. I’m with Greg -- I hope it’s not a 10-year, 12-year event but we are very pleased with it and it’s coming out in January, so --  Greg Maffei The e-water cooler buzz about Spartacus is enormous.  Bill Meyers And not just domestically -- it’s also international. I mean, we had several of the big broadcasters in the international market who already are interested in buying it just off the trailer, so we know we have the right story and it’s something that you have not seen on TV before and we are very pleased with it.  Greg Maffei  And obviously you must be a Lucy Lawless fan, asking that. Maybe you could help me understand exactly the nature of the tax question LCAPA because I am not sure I followed you.  Murray Arenson - Janco Partners Well, I was just referencing in the press release the tax sharing payments between the -- the inter-group tax sharing payments? Chris Shean I can handle this -- Liberty Capital of course is the provider of tax shelter to the other two groups who generate taxable income, and for the six months the interactive group paid $138 million to capital and the entertainment group paid $117 million. So a total of $255 million of cash going back to capital for their tax shelter.  Greg Maffei So in effect, rather than pay the U.S. government, the shelter is created by Capital, Interactive and Entertainment pay Capital and any future liability becomes Capital’s.  Murray Arenson - Janco Partners Understood. Excellent. Thank you.  Greg Maffei Thank you very much for joining us this morning and again for your continued interest in Liberty and thank you to all the participants.

The required definitions and reconciliations, preliminary note and schedules one through three can be found at the end of this presentation. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Maffei. Greg Maffei Good morning and thank you to all of you for joining and for your continued interest in Liberty. Today, we’ll review our performance in Q3 and discuss the operating results at our controlled subsidiaries. Speaking on the call this morning we’ve got Chris Shean, our Controller who will discuss the attributed businesses' financial results and the liquidity picture for each of the trackers; we have got QVC's CEO Mike George; we have got the Starz CEO Bob Clasen; and we have assorted other Liberty, QVC, and Starz executives available to answer your questions. Building on momentum from Q2, we posted strong operating results at QVC and Starz in the third quarter, many of our other businesses had and trend investment type great performance including notably serious. During the quarter, we continued to strengthen the balance sheet. QVC raised a $1 billion in senior secured notes, extended maturities out to 2019 and the offering was quite well received. This was the first $1 billion high-yield deal to price below 8% since DIRECTV priced in May of [2008]. It was just the non-investment grade deal to price below 8% out of 213 transactions year-to-date. It was the first 144A deal to price below 8% since March of 2007. Today, QVC has paid down $344 million of its 2014 revolver, which we would expect to be redrawn to pay the $500 million of term loans due in 2010. QVC expect to be able to continue repay this revolver as free cash flow allowance. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, QVC repaid or rather let to repay $50 million of the intergroup loan it had to each of entertainment and capital group. During the quarter, all of the Liberty stocks reached 52-week high in fact all the reach was in the last couple of months. Additionally, many of the other equities in our public equity portfolio did quite well and the total grew by almost $2 billion led by gains in DIRECTV, which was up 10%, a gain of $1.4 billion, Expedia which was up 59%, a gain of $612 million and SIRIUS XM which was up 24%, a gain of $376 million. At Liberty Entertainment, we continue to experience good results in DIRECTV and we had strong revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth at the consolidating companies, notably the Starz which Bob Clasen will talk about more in a moment. We can see the finish line on the long anticipated LEI DIRECTV transaction. We received a private letter ruling from the IRS. We mailed the effective proxy statement and the stockholder vote is set for November 19 th . Liberty Starz, newly attributed tracker that will be left, has begun trading as well, [OSTAV] trading just under $50. That is up substantially from the indicated price, indicated looking at the difference between the DIRECTV and LMDIA prices, that’s up substantially from numbers more like the mid-20s in the summer. Because of DIRECTV’s continued share repurchase, our ownership is now up to 57% of DIRECTV. Notably, also Bob Clasen, he is planning to retire at the end of the year, or more accurately when we complete the process of search for his successor. At Liberty Interactive, QVC extra and strong adjusted OIBDA growth and adjusted OIBDA margin expansion. You’ll hear more about that from Mike George in a moment. At Liberty Capital, we received $250 million SIRIUS XM loan repayment; all of the senior loans that we made to the company SIRIUS have now been repaid. We still have some secondary market paper notably, bonds that we have purchased because we think they are quite attractive. We had a strong performance, most recently at Overture Films with the movie Law Abiding Citizen and a promising opening weekend, this last weekend for Men Who Stare at Goats. The Brave had a good run on the little short would have a good run in September. Couple of other items before I turn to Chris, Liberty Board has decided not to proceed with the reverse splits that have been authorized at Liberty Capital and Liberty Interactive and the Board has also approved a 500 million share repurchase authorization of Liberty Starz. With that let me turn over to Chris Shean to talk about LINTA's financial results. Chris Shean Thanks Greg. Liberty Interactive groups' revenue increased 2% to $1.8 million while adjusted OIBDA increased 11% to $345 million for the quarter. QVC is the primary driver of results amongst the Liberty Interactive group attributed assets, posted favorable results in which total revenue increased 2% to $1.7 billion while adjusted OIBDA increased 10% to $343 million. eCommerce group of companies at Liberty Interactive which include Provide Commerce, Backcountry.com, Bodybuilding.com, BUYSEASONS, LOCKERZ, and The Right Start experienced revenue growth of 2% in the third quarter and adjusted OIBDA growth of $2 million to $5 million. The increase in revenue driven by two small fold in acquisitions in 2008. During the third quarter, QVC issued $1 billion principal amount of 7.5% senior secured notes due 2019. QVC used the net proceeds to fund the purchase and cancellation of outstanding term loans under QVC senior secured credit facilities that mature in 2014. Now I will hand it over to Mike George for additional comments on QVC. Mike George We were very pleased with our results in Q3, as we continue the improvement in business trends that began in Q2. Sequentially, our local currency revenue growth rates improved in every market except Germany and our adjusted OIBDA growth rates improved in all markets. In total, our revenue increased 2% and adjusted OIBDA increased 10% without the change in revenue recognition practices that we implemented in Q2, our revenue would have been $9 million and adjusted OIBDA would have increased an additional $4 million. These results reflect the success of our sales growth and cost management initiatives along with what appears to be at least some stabilization of consumer spending in the U.S. and U.K. We also appear to be gaining share at an accelerating rate from a broad range of retailers to compete for the consumers discretionary spend in dollars. In the U.S., net revenue increased 2%, our first positive sales growth since early last year. We saw the strongest gains in beauty, accessories, consumer electronics and our kitchen, cook and household categories. As in prior quarters, our jewelry and apparel businesses remained soft, although the rate of decline in jewelry has moderated somewhat, as weakness in gold jewelry was partially offset by strength in lower price point fashion accessory lives. We also saw continued gains in QVC.com which grew 17% and now represents 28% of our sales, up from 24% last year. We benefited from a 100 basis point improvement in return rates, largely driven by product mix. We’re also very encouraged by 9% increase in the count of new customers joining QVC in the quarter, our highest rate of new customer growth in the last seven years. However, as I have stressed in the past, even more important than the count of new customers is their total spending and the total spending of new customers in the quarter increased a very strong 18%. Our adjusted OIBDA in the U.S. increased 10%, our strongest profit growth since the fourth quarter of 2006. The adjusted OIBDA gains were driven in part by approximately 11 million and above the line adjustments in various state, sales and franchise tax reserves. In addition, we benefited from strong improvements in customer service and distribution productivity. Reductions in freight cost due to success of several initiatives to optimize our distribution network and the impact of several cost management efforts on our fixed expense structure. We also saw a slight improvement in product margins, a significant improvement from the trends that we experienced last year and earlier this year. Partially offsetting these gains was a 44 basis point increase in bad debt expenses, although the rate of growth in bad debt appears to be moderated. We continue to control inventory tightly, with the 7% reduction in gross inventory levels year-over-year.  Switching to the U.K., we saw net revenue increased 6% in local currency, our strongest revenue gain since Q1 of last year. We saw strong gains in our beauty and apparel categories, partially offset by difficult jewelry business and continued softness in the computer and consumer electronics categories where we face special aggressive price competition in that market. Our adjusted OIBDA increased 31% in local currency. The strong profitability gain was due in part to anniversary in the foreign exchange losses that suppressed our results last Q3. In addition, we saw strong improvements in customer service and distribution productivity and lower obsolescence expense as we reduced our inventory levels 15% year-over-year. In Germany, our net revenue declined 1% in local currency but while adjusted OIBDA increased 13%. The revenue recognition changes I mentioned earlier had the greatest impact in Germany. Without these changes, revenue would have increased 1%, and adjusted OIBDA would have increased 16%. We saw strong gains in our beauty category, as we continue to focus on our mission of doubling the beauty business in Germany. We also saw strong pick up in accessories, consumer electronics, computers, and small appliances. Offsetting these gains was continued erosion in the jewelry category, and softness in our apparel business. We also continue to make gains reducing the promotional elements of the German business, as we saw increases in the percentage of business done at regular price and reductions in marked down usage. We saw a 4% increase in customer count, our strongest increase in four years. Our strong profitability growth in Germany was driven by gains in customer service and distribution productivity, lower obsolescence rates as we implemented new liquidation approaches with higher net recoveries, lower FX losses, and improvements in our fixed cost structure. In Japan, our net revenue declined 1% in local currency, a slight improvement over our Q2 low point where revenue declined 3%. The economic situation in Japan continues to be the most challenged of all of our markets, and we believe our results are strong relative to the rest of the retail market in Japan. The revenue decline was driven by softness in our home categories, partially offset by growth in health and beauty. Adjusted OIBDA declined 3% in local currency, largely in line with the change in sales. A modest increase in initial product margins, lower freight expenses, and gains in distribution and customer service productivity were offset by increase in obsolescence rates and the impact of anniversary and a sales commission credit that we received last year from one of our affiliates. Finally, we continue to progress with our Italy launch scheduled for October of next year. Overall, we are highly encouraged by the continued momentum in our business. We’re confident that we will emerge from the current economic turmoil in a much stronger position, having made significant gains in our strategy to build the unique multimedia shopping experience. We believe our focus on offering compelling exclusive products and programming while avoiding destructive price competition is helping us drive accelerating share gains against the broad retail market, while also protecting our margins. To further this mission, we recently announced the partnership with Liz Claiborne to become the exclusive third-party retailer of the iconic Liz Claiborne New York brand, as well as a broad-based partnership with Isaac Mizrahi to create a unique lifestyle collection that we’ll launch on December 4th. We also continue to expand our multi-channel platforms, driving strong growth in our eCommerce platform and expanding our social networking programs, and in the next few weeks we’ll be launching new iPhone applications and desktop widgets to help customers stay connected with QVC. We’ve also achieved, as I have mentioned, strong improvements in variable cost productivity and significant structural reductions at fixed costs. Most importantly, we’ve achieved these gains while maintaining our steadfast commitment to provide an outstanding customer service. Inventories across our markets are also well-controlled and overall return rates are declining. We also continue to focus on maximizing our free cash flow, paying down debt and extending maturities. Our adjusted OIBDA gains, coupled with more efficient working capital usage [grew by over] $201 million increase in free cash flow to the first nine months of the year, including a $109 million increase in Q3 versus a year ago. As a result, we paid down an additional $80 million on our revolver in October on top of the $264 million impairments made in prior months. In total, since financing our bank debt last spring, we’ve now reduced outstanding balance on our revolver from 500 million to just a 156 million and we expect to make further payments on the revolver later this year. In addition as you heard, we successfully completed our bond offering in Q3, raising a $1 billion in tenure notes that were used to reduce our 2014 bank debt. And with that, I’ll turn it back to Chris. Chris Shean Moving on to Liberty Entertainment, revenue grew 2% in third quarter to $369 million while adjusted OIBDA increased 16% to $86 million. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by results of Starz Entertainment. The increase in adjusted OIBDA was due to positive results from Starz Entertainment, partially offset by expenses related to the proposed split-off of LEI. Expected liquidity at Liberty Starz upon completion of the split-off and merger would be approximately $850 million. This is made up of actual cash balances, loans to Liberty Interactive, and a $146 million in expected repayments from DIRECTV for payments that we’ve made on the derivative loan. Expected cash at LEI would be approximately, which includes corporate cash and cash at the Liberty Sports Group. Now Bob Clasen will comment on Starz Entertainment and Media. Bob Clasen Thanks, Chris. Starz posted another solid quarter, as Starz Entertainment revenue grew by 8.3% and adjusted OIBDA by 19.2% versus the same quarter a year ago. The average number of Starz subscription units grew 1.4% versus the year ago during the quarter, but the total number of Starz subscriptions on September 30 was down slightly versus the same date last year. Encore average subscriptions declined by 1% and the total number of Encore subscribers at quarter end was 2.8% below the same date last year. Helping to improve results were an increase in average revenue per subscriber and a 2.8% decline in year-to-date operating expenses versus a year ago. The decline in expenses was largely due to airing fewer first run movies during this quarter versus a year ago, reducing our programming costs. This reduction was partially offset by increased expenses both in production and marketing for original series. We continue to play close attention to some of our affiliates, particularly in the cable arena who have experienced declines in subscriber levels. It is our belief that there are several reasons for this development, including the general economic conditions, particularly the decline in housing starts, rate increases implemented by some affiliates earlier in the year and a lack of marketing resources devoted to premium television as a category. We are working with these affiliates to bring more focus to the premium space and improved sales of Starz and Encore subscriptions. On the other hand, we are encouraged by the progress our affiliates are making toward implementation of the Television Everywhere strategy, which will enable existing authenticated Starz subscribers to receive Starz programming on their computers or portable devices as well as at their TV sets. Starz has been a pioneer in the development of online delivery of programming. We welcome the efforts of our distributors in this space. Over the coming years, we’re confident that the distribution of Starz programming over the internet will add to the value of our services for our affiliates and our consumers. Our effort to generate awareness that Starz as a destination for originals as well as movies took the major step forward in the third quarter when we introduced the first trailers for Spartacus: Blood and Sand, first at Comic-Con and then at the television critics tour. The worldwide premier of the series took place in the first week of October at the annual MIPCOM television market in Cannes. These initial unveilings of the series which will air on the Starz channels in January generated considerable buzz as viewers got a first look at some of the innovative techniques that producers Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert used to create the brutal in sensual world of the Roman gladiators. With the feel of movies such as the 300 and Sin City, a first-rate cast and a compelling stories Spartacus will be unlike anything ever before produced for television. We feel confident it will draw audiences to our channel, channels into other platforms worldwide. The latter is particularly important because this is the first dramatic series we’ve produced entirely ourselves and for which we are handling all syndication sales worldwide. Also in the third quarter, we aired the second season of the dramatic series, Crash, which we coproduced with Lions Gate and we announced plans for a new half-hour comedy to air next summer called Gravity starring Krysten Ritter of Confessions of a Shopaholic and Ving Rhames of Pulp Fiction. We also announced that we had renewed a second season for our critically acclaimed comedy series, Party Down. On the Starz media side, revenue in the quarter decreased 46.1% and adjusted OIBDA improved by 13.4%. However, as I previously noted, these numbers fluctuate dramatically from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year depending on the timing of theatrical releases. We were disappointed in the performance of two-third quarter releases, Pandorum with Dennis Quaid and Capitalism: A Love Story from Michael Moore. However, Law Abiding Citizen, starring Jamie Foxx, which opened in early in October, in second place at the box office has already generated over $60 million in domestic ticket sales, well ahead of projections, and our best performing movie to-date. Our last film of 2009, Men Who Stare at Goats, premiered this week weekend and opened at number three with 13.3 million domestic box office, also ahead of our plan. We continue to face challenging environment in the home video arena because of the general economic conditions and because of the theatrical underperformance by some of the Overture release. However, the Overture movies are playing well on demand and in electric electronic sell-through and will bolster the line of our premium channels. Starz Animation Toronto, one widespread critical acclaimed for the animation work it did on the Tim Burton movie released during the quarter by Universal. Anchor Bay Films released three movies in a limited theatrical run and for home video sales during the quarter featuring well known starts such as Ashton Kutcher, Michael Douglas and Jeff Bridges. These films will appear on our Starz channels in 2010 And now, I’ll hand it back to Chris. Chris Shean During the quarter, Liberty Capital revenue decreased 22% to $171 million, while adjusted OIBDA deficit improved by $21 million. The decrease in revenue was principally due to a decrease in theatrical and home video revenue. The decrease in adjusted OIBDA deficit was due primarily to the timing of theatrical and home video revenue and related expenses associated with the films released by Starz Animation and Overture Films. Now, I’ll turn it back over to Greg for some concluding remarks. Greg Maffei Thank you, Chris, and thank you Mike and Bob for the updates on your respective businesses. To sum up, we feel that the third quarter was a strong quarter on a lot of areas, lot of fronts and we saw signs of improvement in several of our businesses, particularly QVC. If you look ahead, our major priorities first across Liberty Media continue to rationalize some of our non-core, non-consolidated investments in third party and look for interesting market opportunities, could only hope to find those serious. Plus Liberty Entertainment, we are going to complete the split-off and merger with DIRECTV hopefully in the coming few weeks. We will reclassify the new tracker Liberty Starz and hopefully launch it well. At Liberty Interactive, QVC is focused on continuing the movement it had in Q3 going into Q4. At Liberty Capital, we continue to evaluate opportunity for our cash including debt buyback, stock buybacks and additional investment opportunities. With by thanking for your continued interest, also want to thank you for your continued support in Liberty Media. Hopefully we’ll keep busy and have some of the report for you in Q4 as well. Thank you for listening and operator I would like to open it up to questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Just a question for Greg and then a couple for Bob. Greg, which is cheaper in your view, SIRIUS stock or LCAPA stock and does your view on that differs factor into your decision making? How to perceive with your ownership stake there? Bob, can you tell us what the amount of the TV production write-down at Starz was this quarter? What your outlook for cost growth might be in the fourth quarter, given you might spend, give or take $15 million bucks marketing Spartacus? Thanks. Greg Maffei Doug, I try not to comment on which of the children I like best, but I will comment on the second part and could say that, that the practical matter if you look, we are prohibited from increasing our investment in SIRIUS XM, as I recall for 18 months from the term of the initial deal which would be about another year from now, first. Then candidly, we’ll be trading lightly in, if we were to do so because of the some of the issues around the tax losses they have in the 382 limitations, so that is not easy path, even though I think SIRIUS is a attractive investment. I think Liberty Capital is quite cheap. Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank To the 382 limitations end right after two years or is there grey area there? Greg Maffei My understanding is ends after three years, so it would be roughly two and half years from now. Bob Clasen Nine months to-date, we’ve amortized it would put on the P&L about $15 million of growth revenue cost and a lot of that did hit in the third quarter. We’re not going to give guidance for the fourth quarter, but we’ll point out that to your question on marketing, we would expect the run rate to be pretty similar to the third quarter, since we had the second season of Crash that had quite a major campaign and would probably be roughly equivalent to some of the lead end we'll be doing in December for Spartacus with a lot of the Spartacus spending coming the first part of January. Operator We'll go next to James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital. James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital Couple of questions, both related to Liberty Starz. First of all, on the buyback authorization, is there any limit to how other than the [starred] SEC limits to how fast you can theoretically deploy that? Related to that, how much cash do you actually really need around to start the Starz business? Then secondly, ARPU for subscriber was up about 9% year-on-year in Starz, but at the same time you saw a subscriber dropping both of Starz non-core. Can you talk about what you say in terms of both revenue with network and buy a mixed shift or contracting increases and secondly for the people cancelling with those more our card customers or customers in high digital tiers? Greg Maffei On the buyback, we don’t have any, to my knowledge any limitations other than as you know that the SEC’s restrictions on what percentage of volume we can be in terms of share repurchase. As far as cash require to operate at Starz, it's almost a non-issue as you look it's a free cash flow generating vehicle, yes they have some working capital need but they also don’t even have a working capital line. We are heavily capitalized or overcapitalized at those businesses today, that's when we take the corporate and then the operating units. Bob Clasen To comment on subscribers, we have again a mix of affiliates who are both have a card and then have fixed payments and so that really, sometimes decline in subscribers; your revenue doesn’t fall off. Part of the dynamic, we see frankly is there is a shift in some numbers of subscribers from cable to the telco business, and our economics are a little more attractive when they are a telco customer than some of the old historic cable dealers, frankly. We are pretty flat at DIRECTV, Dish is having some issues that flow to us. It's frankly a mixed bag. We have got growth in some affiliates, or at least are holding our own. We have got some declines in the cable space and in the dish space. With regard to cash, we are a cash generator. We are not needing cash from our parent or from the banks in order to operate. We are a generator, and that will be showing up over time on the Liberty Starz reports. James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital But in terms of cash on hand, it's a pretty minimal amount you need just to run the business day to day? Chris Shean Right, we have a strong balance sheet as a standalone company. Operator We will go next to Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Two questions, first of all on whether the QVC numbers look great, and when you get better sales you are going to get ample drop-through. I thought the e-commerce businesses were a little disappointing. I mean you communicated it pretty well on Backcountry, given the pressure on the higher price point items. It looks like the enthusiast businesses were not quite as robust as you might have thought. Could you give us a little bit more granularity there, and then how we should think about the growth factor on those businesses longer term, because it did appear to be really coasting through the first part of this recession; and then secondly, another Spartacus variant, it looks I guess you could have $30 million to $35 million of costs on that expense next year. Are you going to get enough of a continued savings, albeit at a slower pace on the reduced amount of studio products offsetting us, or we have to see some margin pressure and be within Spartacus, no matter how wonderful it is as far as improving the marketing profile and the brand of Starz? Mike George Note that in general statistics we’ve been saying, for example, comScore recently reported their expectation that eCommerce as a whole was down 2% in Q3. I think you’re saying right. I think you’re hearing and seeing that some of the -- just the timing and the difficulties around Q3 for eCommerce are not unique. That having been said, it’s not one of our big quarters. Q4, we expect that [country] is going to have a substantially better quarter from where it was. The driver for the biggest element by far our eCommerce businesses provide in terms of an OIBDA number is obviously a Q1 or Q2, usually Q2 event, so Q1 and Q2, not Q3. I think they had a good performance in a tough environment in a quarter that is not as critical as it [sounds for us] Chris Shean We’re looking obviously at 2010, and while we’re not going to provide guidance, I’ll make a couple observations. First of all, our output partners are having a better year at the box office than they did in 2008, and that flows to increased costs to us for our new feature linked films, so there will be an increase in programming costs driven by that. With regard to Spartacus, certainly that will influence our programming cost. Remember, Spartacus has a long useful life; we don’t amortize everything with its first use. There is a period over three years in which it will be amortized on its play. We are expecting programming to go up for those two reasons next year. Operator Our next question will come Bridget Washa with JPMorgan. Bridget Washa - JPMorgan I had two questions on the Liberty Interactive segment. First of all, Germany I know is still in the midst of its turnaround and there is a lot of mixed shift going on driving changes. If you look at the units shipped, it looks like it declined significantly during the quarter. Could you discuss what’s driving this a little bit more, and when you expect the mix shift to moderate in this segment? Then secondly, I think you mentioned how much free cash flow growth you were seeing that winter. Could you give us that number again on a year-over-year basis, and what you see driving us? Thank you. Greg Maffei Sure. I’ll discuss Germany and let Dan comment on the cash flow. We cannot segregate revenue into units and ASP and put a lot of focus on that because for us it's really about what's the consumer’s total spend with us, and I think that’s the best reflection of the health of the business. I would hate to characterize what you will see in terms of units versus ASP, but I think you basically saw was a flat quarter, slightly up without the revenue recognition, and I think that sort of characterizes the business, suppression in jewelry and apparel strength in the other zones. Now, specifically the technical reason that units were down and ASPs was up was really more just kind of product mix drivers. We saw the jewelry business that we did do, we did at a higher ASP; it's a substantially higher ASP. That was in large part due to the reduction in markdowns. So the good news is, we’re using markdowns less frequently. The inventory is better. The products' better. Less markdowns means higher ASPs, so for the same kind of revenue velocity you get fewer units but better ASPs, so that dynamic is hard to predict from quarter-to-quarter because it’s really driven by product mix. We again focus more just on sort of absolute revenue growth. Then Dan, you want to comment on the cash flow? Dan O'Connell Sure. The $200 million that Mike referenced for the year-to-date period is primarily a function of working capital. If you look at year-to-date 2009 working capital items are a source of cash by about $185 million and last year they were a use of cash of about $140 million, so that’s the biggest drivers. Bridget Washa - JPMorgan Do you expect that to be sustainable going forward or to be more seasonal due to the economy? Dan O'Connell In our fourth quarter last year working capital was about $200 million use of cash and I would think that directionally it will move in that direction, but I don’t expect it to be as high as $200 million in the fourth quarter. Operator Our next question will come from Doug Anmuth with Barclays Capital. Doug Anmuth - Barclays Capital I just had a question about return rates in the U.S. and in particular it looks like in 1Q and 2Q, you saw a sort of a bigger decline basically in return rates year-over-year. I was just curious what your thoughts are there in terms of why it bounced back sort of on a sequential basis from 17% to 19% and how we should think about that going forward. Dan O'Connell In Q3, we had about 100 basis point favorability in our return rate at 19.3% and that’s mixed driven as Mike mentioned previously. For the full-year it's about 1.7%, 50 basis points of that is a true-up over accrual call it at the end of 2008. Obviously, we have to estimate what our return rates are going to be and they came in less for Q4 and we recognized that in the first two quarters of the year. Operator Our next question will come from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Bazinet - Citi It’s a separate question on Liberty Interactive. I think there was a question earlier about the eCommerce EBITDA what you helped us out with provide color, but I’ve one another question regarding some disclosures in the queue that relate to, I think it was called third-party online discount services that was, that sort of a $6 million or $7 million per quarter in each of the first two quarters of the year. I guess there are two questions there. Can you explain what those are and are those very high margin revenues and will they repeat? Dan O'Connell They are offers to our customers by third parties and I think they do have repetition factor, whether there is high growth going forward is not as clear, we’ll see. I think by [common] and lot of eCommerce companies offer these other services to your customers and that is a relatively high margin business. Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Do we see a similar amount in the third quarter, in other words it was most of the miss in the EBITDA? Dan O'Connell No, no. It’s just because of the nature of how they come, I think we saw less in the third quarter but not any negative way, just try to the offerings in the marketplace. I don’t think it has the trend value. Operator David Gober with Morgan Stanley has our next question. David Gober - Morgan Stanley A quick one for, Bob; I was just wondering if you could remind us when you expect to hear from Disney about whether or not they are going to extend their output deal which I believe expires in 2012? Bob Clasen We’re meeting with Disney all the time and we have nothing to report. David Gober - Morgan Stanley Is there a day by which there has to… Bob Clasen No, no. They do not have an option. David Gober - Morgan Stanley The current deal expires in 2012, am I right? Bob Clasen For domestic output 2012. Greg Maffei It will be clear, (inaudible) with the channels. It’s really through 13. 12 for DBO, 13 for the channels. David Gober - Morgan Stanley And one for Mike, some of the customer acquisition numbers that you threw out there, were very impressive. Any sense of what’s driving the new customer acquisition? Is it just the improvement in the overall economy? Are new customers coming in different categories than they have been in the past year or so? Mike George No, I think it’s a couple of things. I think part of it is that I would say, we’re in a product mix which we have worked hard to create a product mix that is more favorable to getting new names probably due to our efforts and probably just due to what’s hot right now and so for example, the exercised category, some elements of it are hot and they tend to bring in a lot of new names. We really run after entertainment properties like Michael Jackson, Beatles Remastered; those sorts of properties. They’ve been doing very well for us and those are extremely high with new names, so some of that is driven by those initiatives that are product based and some is driven by the more aggressive marketing and PR outreach that we’ve been doing, trying to bring in a high profile branch like a Rachel Zoe who has her own celebrity following and has attracted unusually high new names for the kind of product categories that Rachel is offering. I think it’s a mix of the quality of the talent, the kinds of hot categories and degree of aggressiveness and PR and marketing outreach and actually I try to put in one more factor which is we have continued to improve our channel positioning. I think it's fair to say that, we probably never made more gains than we've made this year and the quality of our channel positioning that includes getting a second location on DIRECTV and a much more highly trafficked neighborhood, as well as we are now up to about $25 million high definition subs and I think virtually every case those present a second channel location in addition to the SD channel. I think we are seeing the benefit of just being exposed to more people and more attractive neighborhoods. David Gober - Morgan Stanley Has the demographic profile changed significantly of new customers coming in I mean have you been getting a younger customer, older customer? Mike George I have not looked at it specifically for this quarter. We don’t tend to find that amused in meaningful ways quarter-to-quarter. I hesitate to guess what we have generally found over the last few years is that new customers are not surprisingly are younger than existing customers and the age of that new customers has been relatively stable overtime. Don’t know specifically, if it's changed in Q3. David Gober - Morgan Stanley That’s very helpful and just a quick one for Greg. Obviously, we see the Form 4s on IAC stock sales but was there any other movement in publically traded assets during the quarter? Greg Maffei Can’t recall of any substantial ones, we have small positions that we move, but nothing materially that I can think of that happened in Q3. The caller expiring on Sprint, I think we've talked about that, and that obviously was offset by reduction in the borrowings against the Sprint caller. That was a fairly neutral event. Operator We’ll go next to Murray Arenson with Janco Partners. Murray Arenson - Janco Partners Couple of quasi-related questions if I could. On the heels of your comments on the eCommerce business, can you comment on what you see out there in terms of potential acquisition opportunities or things are still looking pretty rich out there? Secondly in looking at QVC’s business and the business you’re doing through QVC.com, can you talk about where you see that potentially growing, maybe a few years out, how much of the business can that be for you? Greg Maffei On acquisition opportunities, we have been pretty much constantly looking for eCommerce opportunities. The last four years, we found four decent sized acquisitions and the couple or three tuck-ins that have worked well into those. Because that has been difficult and if you look at the universe of eCommerce companies, pure eCommerce company, certainly that’s not a huge universe between $50 million and say $5 billion a market cap and particularly ones that we would find attractively strong management teams, define niches, (inaudible) advantages in their business model and protections around Warren Buffett mode type things. Those are not, at time it does and in particularly when you want a reasonable price. There has been a whole change obviously in the blending kind of a content commerce and community that have only made some of that harder because a lot of those have had very large multiples and have more speculative business models. That having been said, we continue to look and we remain bullish on some opportunities and we’ve also taken a couple of tracks like Right Start when we purchase something out of bankruptcy or LOCKERZ where we funded an entrepreneur a little more venture capital type opportunity to try and create a wholesale version of something like that rather than buying at retail. We still look. I don’t think the environment’s got easier in fact I think it's probably got tougher in terms of 2002, eCommerce becoming more expensive and then we’re trying to skin the cat in new ways. I'll let Mike handle the QVC. Mike George On QVC, I’ll talk about the U.S. where the dotcom business is obviously the most developed and 28% right now and Q3 is actually a seasonal low point for dotcom penetration in a grow up. It will go up fair amount in Q4. Our internal goal is to be at 50% QVC.com penetration, so half of our sales are coming from QVC.com by 2014. I don’t think that’s a crazy goal. I think that’s a reasonable stretch goal. We’re going to continue to accelerate on investments in QVC.com experience and we see growing at both as a compliment to the TV channel and as an independent business attracting customers and products separate from the main channel. We think that can get us to those kinds of numbers by 2014. I think we’ll see similar improvements in our international dotcom businesses but they start from a lower base but I think all will be on a fairly attractive trajectory and especially as we roll out a global eCommerce platform next year, its rather than the country’s specific platforms that we currently have we’ll be able to implement much higher levels of functionality in our international operations, which I think will create further boost to those businesses. I wouldn’t take a number on that yet, but in the U.S. I would say 50% over five years is sort of a reasonable framework. Operator We will go next to Grant Jordan with Wells Fargo. Grant Jordan - Wells Fargo Maybe if you could give us an idea in total what the QVC inventory is year-over-year just in terms of relative terms and how you think you are positioned going into the holidays. Greg Maffei I will make some general comments and then let Dan give you the numbers. Overall, we feel very good about our inventory position going into the holidays. Given the uncertainty of this year, we gave the challenge to all of our markets to manage inventory very tightly, stay close to receipt flow. We feel reasonably clean going into the holidays with the ability to chase goods if the sales are there. We are clean but not too clean, and we have the ability to kind of respond pretty quickly. So at a qualitative level we feel quite good about the balance of keeping inventories tight but also having sufficient inventory to fund Q4, and I will let Dan give you the numbers. Dan O’Connell So, on a consolidated basis, at the end of the quarter we had roughly $975 million of inventory, and same period last year about $75 million more. We have cut about five days of sales out of our inventory since September of last year. Grant Jordan - Wells Fargo Sure, that’s very helpful. Then my second question, again on QVC. Mike, you talked about picking up market share for some other players. Was there any specific category where you felt like you were picking up notable market share during the quarter? Mike George I think in terms of specific categories I would say that we are clearly gaining market share in consumer electronics, which continues to be a very hot business for us. I think we’re definitely gaining share in beauty, and we've built a really wonderful prestige beauty business that I think is outgrowing virtually anyone else out there. I suspect -- although it's a more fragmented market, so it's harder to track, but I think in areas like accessories and handbags, I think we are gaining share as well. And then our downtrend in categories like jewelry and apparel, I don't know that we’re gaining share but I also don't think we are losing share. I think those categories are pretty tough for everyone. Operator We'll go next to Steve Velgot with SIG. Steve Velgot - SIG Yes, a quick question for Greg. Is there a scenario where you could see combining a Starz Media with Starz Entertainment before Starz Media is cash flow positive, and can you give us some idea as to how we might look at valuation even if it’s sometime off? Greg Maffei Well, I think to be clear, would be s combination of Starz Media with Liberty Starz, or with Starz Entertainment the channels, so just to be [guarding] that vehicle. When you think about valuation, I think it would be a function of not only the run rate whether it'd be loss or positive, but what the value and the ultimate that are being built up there, and that is not today, because we've not had as much success at the box office as we would like. That's probably not an enormously scaled number compared to the value of the channel. What they would be in the future will depend largely on how our ultimate [build] going forward, and if we have successful films that will create value and makes Starz Media worthwhile. It's not the only element that is generating value, or not a Starz Media, but it is probably the one with the largest built-in swing factor. Steve Velgot - SIG And therefore, are you still intent on waiting until Starz Media is cash flow positive in order to pursue? Bob Clasen No, I think we are intent on trying to make sure that we have a stable business model and good direction for Starz Media, and understand fully where it is going and what it might be worth and whether this model is compatible with channels going on a long term basis. Greg Maffei With that I think we’re done for the morning again. Thank you for your interest in Liberty, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter. Thank you.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Maffei. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Maffei Thank you, and good morning. Thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in Liberty. Today, we\'ll review our year and quarter results by tracker; we\'ll discuss the operating performance of our control subsidiaries; and, we\'ll cover some transaction and developments we\'ve had in the year, prior quarter, and the end of the year. Liberty controller, Chris Shean, will discuss the attributed business financial results and liquidity picture for each tracker. QVC CEO, Mike George, will discuss recent events and developments at QVC. And Starz CEO, Chris Albrecht, will review events at Starz. Also on the call with me today are the QVC CFO, Dan O\'Connell; Starz Entertainment President and COO [ph], Bill Myers; Starz CFO, Glenn Curtis; and, several other senior Liberty Media executives. All of us will be available to answer questions after these prepared remarks. I\'m sure you\'ve seen today\'s announcement that we have made a change in the attribution of certain assets and liabilities between Liberty Capital and Liberty Interactive. The reasons we made these moves were, first, to rationalize the capital structure of both groups; second, to provide increased flexibility in the future for both groups; and, a significant motivator was strengthening the near and mid term liquidity of the Liberty Interactive. We\'re always quite comfortable with Liberty Interactive\'s ability to cover its upcoming maturities. But the market hasn\'t similarly been as comfortable sometimes in the past nor today, and we\'ve got this re-attribution. We\'ll continue to further enhance its liquidity. Secondly, we\'re aligning the tax loss generating debt. As you know and as we\'ve discussed in the past, these exchangeable debts that we are moving – or re-attributing, rather, have certain features, which generate a tax deduction larger than the interest payments being made in the interim until the debts mature. We\'re moving that tax loss generating debt with the equity that produces the most income. QVC is our largest earner; putting bad debt with QVC has made the most sense. We\'re putting all of the Live Nation\'s stock in the entity. Liberty Capital and we believe that it\'s best suited for that investment. Let me look at a little bit by tracker what we\'re doing. At LINT, we\'re putting an additional cash of $807 million. That\'s enough to pay off the straight debts that we have maturing in 2013. We\'re putting in the attributed long term Sprint and Motorola exchangeable debentures. We\'re putting in some tax liabilities associated with our 2009 redemption of some of those Sprint exchangeable bad debt. And we\'re changing the attribution of $24.5 million Live Nation Entertainment shares to help cap at the market price. The benefit to LINT, as I touched on above, were the liquidity in the form of $807 million of cash plus the tax savings that these exchangeable debentures are generating, which should help address all-year and mid term maturities. Re-attributed debt is long term, low interest rate debt, with, as I mentioned, very favorable tax characteristics. That non-tax, non-cash interest deduction will help shield income produced by QVC and our e-commerce company. The move will be cash flow positive since the cash interest is less than today\'s cash tax benefit. And it\'s worth noting that that tax benefit is growing. LINT, Liberty Interactive, nor QVC could issue similar debt today, neither because of the rate – the low rate which this debt has nor the long term tenure. But if you look at what\'s changing in LCAP, it is being credit with $24.5 million Live Nation shares. It is eliminating the attribution of the exchangeable debt that – the Sprint debt and the Motorola debt, and the associated tax liabilities. And it is having its attributed cash reduced by $807 million. We think some of the benefits to LCAP include reduced attributed debt balance and reduced and attributed tax liabilities. Obviously, the addition of the attributed Live Nation shares, as you may recall, currently have a tender in place as well for incremental Live Nation shares at Liberty Capital. So now all of those shares will be in Liberty Capital. And we believe this is a good use of cash – of capital by Liberty Capital. Here\'s a rough description of how we arrived at the $807 million cash payment from LCAP to LINT. Of this $807 million, $307 million is for the Live Entertainment stake, for the Live Nation Entertainment stake, LYV, that\'s the 24.5 million shares at the market price of yesterday. The gross liability associated with the exchangeable debt, $1 billion, is made up of a market price for the debt of about $700 million, a foregone OID, originally issued discount, deduction. Since LINT isn\'t issuing this debt, it doesn\'t get that OID deduction that it would normally get, and the call value of the Mot exchangeable. As you recall, this exchangeable debt has a call feature, which effectively gives the holder the upside in the stocks, either Sprint or Motorola, depending on how those stocks move. The Mot exchangeable has that call auction on Mot stock, and that has some value. The Sprint exchangeable, both series have, as I mentioned, the same Sprint call option embedded inside. But those call options are so proud of the money because the Sprint stock is far below the exchangeable price that it becomes really – has no subsequent value. And the last piece of the equation is – in that the present value of the tax liabilities associated with the exchangeable debt we redeemed in 2009. We know that Liberty will have to pay this liability of $325 million – $320 million (inaudible) over the years, 2014 to 2018. And that\'s worth about $200 million on a present value basis. Offsetting this is the net present value of the benefits of the exchangeable debt that\'s about $500 million that the net value of the tax deductions related to exchangeable debt, the benefit of taking the current tax deductions, which are growing, offset by the liability of the interest re-capture at the maturity of the debt. We also looked into several qualitative factors that we took into account. First, as I mentioned before, Liberty Interactive\'s inability to issue this type of favorable long term debt in current market conditions are likely every at all given to the high yield issuer. We took into account some of the risks that the tax benefits might not be fully realized. We took into account some of the risks that the tax liabilities might be accelerated. And we took into account other risks, including change in the tax law or other laws, reduction to Liberty Interactive\'s ability to utilize the tax benefits. The net of that is about $1 billion of these liabilities where – if subtracted by about $500 million of net present value with tax benefits resulted in the cash payment to LINT of about $500 million. So you combine the $307 million for the Live Nation shares and the $500 million for the assumption of the exchangeable debt to get the $807 million tax or total payment. Liberty and its Board used this with a fair exchange of value between Liberty Capital and Liberty Interactive. As you may recall, we\'ve been through this process before. We just previously did an exchange of debt between Liberty Interactive and LMDIA. We moved over the Biocom [ph] exchangeables. Just in the same cake, we looked at this favorable to both ready in achieving their goals. And as a required case, we used a leading investment bank to confirm our view of values. Liberty Starz was not affected in any way by these moves. And I will be happy as the rest of the team will be to answer your questions about this transaction, for this re-attributed in the Q&A portion of our call. So let me turn now to the fourth quarter and year-end results. 2009, no surprise to any of you who\'s been watching, was much better than 2008. We had several transformative deals. The purchase of our Sirius XM interest, the spin-off of Liberty Entertainment and its subsequent merger into DirecTV. We had numerous other positive transactions. We really strengthened our balance sheet by both restructuring our debt, extending maturities, and retiring debt. Since the end of the year, we continued this process of rationalization, a passive investment on a tax efficient basis, as always focused on reducing what we believe is a substantial discount to net asset value at almost – at all of our interviews. That\'s for those transactions that are included the sale of our low book, high basis, IC shares, and the sale of all of our GSI Commerce is a great company that had a great run in their stock. We\'ve been happy shareholders. But the reality is as a minority shareholder, we were unlikely to get the full benefit of the position. And lastly, our tender for Live Nation, which is still in process. At Liberty Interactive, QVC had a very impressive, which capped to greatly improved 2009 overall. I give full credit to the wonderful job by the management team. We, as I mentioned, have been – liquidity at Liberty Interactive through the sale of IC and GSI shares. As I mentioned before, we restructured its debt. QVC has paid down some of its bank lines. And QVC has extended maturities through a bond issuance. At the e-commerce companies, we had very solid growth in revenue and even better growth in our OIBITDA. Looking for a moment at Liberty Starz, notably, we issued our new tracking stock, Liberty Starz in November upon the completion of OEI spin-off and merger with DirecTV. We hired a new CEO, Chris Albrecht. He started right after the first of the year, and we\'ll hear from him in a moment. We gave you Spartacus, our original programming, to record viewership for Starz. And since Liberty Starz began trading, we repurchased about 1.2% of the outstanding shares since November through January. Lastly, we sold our stake in WildBlue, which we had received – which resulted in our holding of Bioset stock of about $20 million. It\'s worth noting because Liberty Capital had been a lender to WildBlue, it also received through the merger about $250 million of cash proceeds as its debt was repaid, and about $28 million of the assessed stock related to warrants we\'ve received as a lender in that transaction. Lastly, expansion of Liberty Capital, they reported this morning Sirius XM posted very strong operating results. And our shares are currently trading in the value of about $2.8 billion. With that, let me turn it to Chris Shean and let him talk about Liberty Interactive\'s financial results. Chris Shean Thanks, Greg. Liberty Interactive Group\'s revenue increased 14% to $2.7 billion for the fourth quarter, and increased 3% to $8.3 billion for the year, while adjusted OIBITDA increased 29% to $556 million for the quarter and 6% to $1.7 billion for the year. QVC, the primary driver of the results for Liberty Interactive had a very strong quarter, and its total revenue 14% to $2.4 billion, and 1% to $7.4 billion for the year, while adjusted OIBITDA increased 27% to $530 million in the fourth quarter, and 4% to $1.6 billion for the year. Liberty Interactive\'s other e-commerce businesses continued to grow at a solid pace. In total, our e-commerce business has experienced growth – revenue growth of 17% in the fourth quarter and 20% for the year, while adjusted OIBITDA grew 63% in the fourth quarter and 45% for the year. Now let\'s take a quick look at Liberty Interactive\'s liquidity. At the end of 2009, the group had attributed cash and public investments of $4.2 billion and $6.3 billion in attributed debt. Over the past year, Liberty and QVC management have been working to address its debt maturity schedule and reduce leverage. Along with a refinancing of bank debt in the Second quarter, QVC accessed the bond market in the third quarter. QVC had already fully covered its $425 million maturity due in 2010 by creating capacity in this revolver by paying it down by $425 million. Although the re-attribution will increase LINTA’s leverage, the re-attributed debt is long term, low cost, with favorable tax characteristics and it will enhance LINTA’s liquidity and its ability to handle near and medium term maturities. Subsequent to quarter end, LINTA added to its cash balance by completing the sale of the remaining low vote IC shares that it held, and also sold all the shares in GSI Commerce for approximately $220 million. Now, I hand the call over to Mike George for additional in-depth comments on QVC. Mike George Thank you, Chris. We’re very encouraged by our results in Q4 with 14% revenue growth and 27% adjusted OIBITDA growth. We posted our strongest quarterly results in over 10 years, and moved the full year results in the positive territory with 1% revenue growth and 4% adjusted OIBITDA growth for the full year. These results were well ahead of most retailers. And we continue to take share against the broader market. Now we’re also encouraged by the balanced nature of our performance, with strong gains in both top and bottom line results, and improving trends in all markets on a local currency basis. Q4 was the first quarter since Q1 of 2008 when every country posted positive revenue growth in local currency. And now I’ll lock to the results in each market. In the US, we increased revenue 13%. Our consumer electronics, kitchen and floor care, beauty, accessories, and fashion jewelry businesses were all strong. In addition, our parallel business, while soft, remained significantly over the trend – improved significantly over the trend the prior quarter, and jewelry, especially gold, did remain difficult, however. Our investments in e-commerce continue to pay off with qvc.com posting 27% revenue growth, but the Internet represented 31% of total sales in the US in Q4, three-point increase over the prior Q4. Our return rate declined from 17.7% last Q4 to 16.4%, further strengthening top line results. Inventory levels remained highly controlled and were essentially flat with the prior year. We improved or adjusted OIBITDA margin by over 300 basis points, driving a 32% growth in adjusted OIBITDA. This improvement was driven by strong productivity gains in our distribution and customer service operations, greater freight efficiencies as we optimized our shipping network, improvements in our fixed cost structure, and a reduction and bad debt expense rate, our first reductions since 2007. Perhaps most encouraging news in the quarter that we had 720,000 new customers joined QVC US. That’s a 22% increase in the count of new customers over the prior year, and revenue from new customers was up 53% over the last year. This growth in both new customer count and (inaudible) revenue increased 6% in local currency, our third consecutive quarter of improving revenue trends. We saw a strong growth in beauty and personal care, and continued strength and passion, offset by softness in consumer electronics and some areas of home. Return rate improved though for 100 basis points, and we reduced our inventory levels over 35% from the prior year on a local currency basis. Suggested OIBITDA grew 25% in local currency, with suggested OIBITDA margins increasing nearly 320 basis points. The largest driver of this improvement was anniversary, foreign exchange loses from the prior year, and dollar denominated inventory purchases. In Germany, revenue increased 8% in local currency. This growth was fuelled by strong gains in beauty, health, accessories, offset by ongoing softness in jewelry where we continue to put back airtime. Return rates were slightly down in the quarter and we reduced inventory in 18% on a local currency basis. Germany, like the US, enjoyed strong gains in customer count with 16% growth in the quarter, an encouraging sign for a lot of growth prospects in Germany. I should have said new customer count. Adjusted OIBITDA increased 5% in local currency and a 70-basis point decline in adjusted OIBITDA margins. And that decline was driven primarily by softer product margins. In Japan, revenue increased 4% in local currency. This was the first positive growth for Japan since Q1 as the team successfully navigated the global economic challenges and was a particularly strong performance in light of our 19% growth in Q4 with the prior year. Fashion and beauty enjoyed strong growth, partly offset by softness in the home and jewelry categories. Adjusted OIBITDA grew 9% in Japan on 116-basis point improvement in adjusted OIBITDA margins. These gains were driven by higher initial project margins, improved distribution and call center productivity, and lower marketing cost. Now we continue to make good progress with our Italy launch, and we are on schedule for our planned October opening in Italy. We incurred about $5 million on operating and SG&A expense throughout 2009 associated with the Italy start-up. And we anticipate an adjusted OIBITDA loss of $30 million to $40 million in Italy for the full year of 2010. Our capital expenditures, company-wide for 2009, were approximately $181 million. And we anticipate CapEx of about $225 million to $250 million for 2010, including costs associated with the Italy start-up. We see our share gains over other retailers who compete for discretionary spending dollars as a positive indication that our efforts to create a new kind of shopping experience are working, an experience that uniquely blends content commerce and community. Compelling exclusive content is powering our business. The debut of our Isaac Mizrahi lifestyle brand, one of the biggest brand launches in our history is just (inaudible). (inaudible) in Q4 included NARS Cosmetics, Steven Wetdiamondz [ph], Godiva chocolates, new fashion lines by leading stylists and designers like Rachel Zoe and Eva Rose; and Sony, VCO, and Nintendo in consumer electronics. These brands showing the powerhouse lineup of existing brands at QVC, with standout performance in the quarter by among others, Steve Makowski and handbags, Rachel Ray and cookware; Harry Slatkin [ph] and home fragrances; Philosophy, Bobby Brown, and Clarsonic [ph] in beauty, our (inaudible) and Foot-free in consumer electronics, and Dennis Basso in fashion. We continued our focus on creating major events in an entertaining programming that draws viewers and creates buzz in the industry and among consumers. Our Mizrahi launch, for example, received extensive press coverage. And our Black Friday weekend sales were extraordinary as we went head-to-head with traditional retail, offering a better shopping experience without the hassle of the mall, and also without doing costly loss leader promotions. Dell notebooks, Keurig coffee brewers, and philosophy were especially strong on that weekend. E-commerce growth, as I’ve noted, continues to be critical to our business. On a global basis, our Internet revenues grew 28% in the quarter, and for the full year, our total Internet revenues company-wide were $1.8 billion. And we continue to expand our platforms. In December we launched an iPhone application in the US that has been downloaded by 115,000 customers in a little over two months. In Japan, we launched our next-generation mobile phone offering, which includes live streaming and video on demand. And in the UK, we expanded our interactive TV applications. And while we worked on these initiatives to grow top line sales and increased market share, we also stay committed to improving profitability and margins. We increased operating productivity and reduced cost in all markets, cut total inventory levels and dramatically improve free cash flow. Looking forward, while we recognize that the pace of consumer spending recovery is uncertain, we remain committed to creating a better shopping experience, gaining market share, and driving balance top and bottom line results. With that, I’ll turn it back to Chris. Chris Shean Thanks, Mike. Let’s take a look at Liberty Starz. While this tracking stock was issued in November, all amounts shown and discussed are – if this tracking stock structure had existed in its current form for the full year. Liberty Starz attributed revenue grew 6% in the fourth quarter to $304 million and 7% to $1.2 billion for the year, while adjusted OIBITDA decreased 3% to $74 million for the quarter and increased 29% to $374 million for the year. At year-end, Liberty Starz had attributed cash and public holdings of $825 million and attributed debt of $48 million. This does not include the $158 million inter-company loan to Liberty Interactive. From November 19th through January 29th, Liberty repurchased 643,000 shares of this tracking stock at an average cost of $48.62 for a total consideration of $31 million. This represents 1.2% of the shares outstanding. Now, Chris Albrecht will comment on events at Starz Entertainment and Starz Media. Greg Maffei Chris, are you on line there? Okay. We\'ve had a technical glitch getting Chris on. So in the interim, we\'ll let Bill Myers talk about the quarter. And then when we get Chris on, we’ll bring him back or have him be available for questions. Bill Myers Good morning. Starz Entertainment had a very strong year in 2009 and is well positioned for 2010. For the year, adjusted OIBITDA rose 28% versus 2008 for a total of $384 million. This came on revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 7% versus 2008. Three factors contributed to the increase in revenue, an increase in the average weighted number of subscribers, an increase in revenue per subscriber, and revenue from new products and services, and the sale of original programming to third parties on multiple platforms in the US and international marketplace. Programming costs continued to decline from $629 million in 2008 to $615 million in 2009. This decline resulted from a reduction in the number of first-run movies, which are more expensive, offset by an increased used of less expensive library products and increased amortization of production costs with original series. In the fourth quarter, adjusted OIBITDA dropped to $78 million from $93 million in the third quarter of 2009, largely because of the marketing campaigns and production cost amortization associated with that two big dramatic series, Spartacus Blood and Sand and Crash. The marketing campaign for Spartacus, which began in December and continued into the first quarter of this year, is the largest ever at Starz. On the original front with respect to Crash, we have decided not to renew Crash as it did not meet our audience expectations. And one of the big impacts in the fourth quarter of this – of 2009 is an evaluation of the future performance of Crash, and we ended up writing off $8 million of production costs to bring it back into fair value. But with Spartacus, which premiered in January, has proven to be a major hit attracting the largest audience for Starz Original ever. It ranks first in the rating towards evening time slot among all premium channels. And because of its performance, we have already announced plans for a second season. Also in the fourth quarter, we announced the renewal of our comedy, "Tear His Party Down", and unveiled plans to produce a new romantic comedy half-hour series Grappy [ph]. Both will air in the spring of this year. On the affiliate front, we continue to work with our affiliates to bolster our strong line up of high definition channels. And we were pleased that Dish Network last month became the first to launce high-definition virgins of Indieplex and Retroplex. While the average number of subscribers for the year improved versus last year. We continue to realize subscriber losses in the fourth quarter as we did in the second and third quarters. However, there were signs towards the end of the year that the subscriber numbers have begun to stabilize. In particular, we saw improvement in the sale of Starz subscriptions in certain communities that had been particularly hard hit by the general economic downturn and where subscriber losses earlier in 2009 had been especially pronounced. We are hopeful that in the general – as the general economy improves, the subscriber numbers will follow. In addition, we have reached agreements with nearly all our major affiliates that will ensure that our services are included in their marketing campaigns in the coming months to a greater degree than in 2009. Most of the subscriber loses came from affiliates with contracts that are fixed in nature and therefore do not negatively impact our revenue. Among affiliates where we share the revenue from added subscribers, we realized aggregate subscriber gains in 2009. This combination contributed to the increase in total revenue and revenue per subscriber, even though the total number of subscribers declined at each of the last three quarters of 2009. Turning to Starz Media, our business units in 2009 continued to make progress even in a challenging economic environment. For the year, revenue increased 13% to $364 million adjusted OIBITDA improved from a negative $189 million in 2008 to a negative $93 million in 2009. The improvements resulted primarily from the increased revenues from movies distributed by Overture Films as they reached the home video premium television and syndication markets. Costs declined largely because Overture released fewer films in 2009 than in 2008. Nevertheless we recognize that significant challenges remained for Overture, and we are currently evaluating strategic alternatives for it. While a final decision has not been made regarding the future of Overture, we do not expect yet to incur annual operating losses in the future of the same magnitude that it has experienced in recent years. And now, I’ll turn it back over to Chris. Chris Shean Thanks, Bill.   Turning to Liberty Capital, during the quarter Liberty Capital revenue increased 18% to $154 million, while the adjusted OIBITDA deficit decreased 29% to $76 million. For the year, revenue increased 6% to $649 million, and the adjusted OIBITDA deficit decreased 41% to $175 million. Taking a look at Liberty Capital’s liquidity picture, the Liberty Capital Group has attributed cash and public investments of $7.9 billion. This is as of 12/31/09. And it includes the Sirius stake. It has attributed debt of $4.3 billion. This does not include the $158 million inter-company loan to Liberty Interactive. From November 2nd through January 29th, Liberty purchased 82,000 shares Sirius.A Liberty Capital common stock at an average price of $22.94 for a total cash consideration of $1.9 million. Cumulative repurchases, that’s the reclassification of this tracking stock, represent 26.2% of the shares outstanding. Now with that, I’ll turn the call back to Greg. Greg Maffei Great, Chris. Thank you very much. Let me also thank Mike and Bill, stepping in for Chris Albrecht for your updates on the Starz businesses and the QVC business. Now let me – Chris? Chris Albrecht Greg. Yes, sorry I was on the call the whole time. You guys could not hear me. Greg Maffei Yes, we couldn\'t. Obviously, there was a technical glitch. Well we\'ll– Chris Albrecht My apologies. Greg Maffei Not a problem. Bill ably stepped up and handled the quarters\' results. Let me talk briefly about the year ahead. And as you can see, the changes in the attribution of debt and assets between Liberty Interactive and Liberty Capital are effective immediately, and we view them as positive, as I mentioned, for both trackers. We believe that positions in both trackers possibly the future to focus on the drivers of value that are critical to each. These include at Liberty Interactive focusing on receiving full credit for our premium retailers, QVC, and our group of e-commerce companies; continued growth at both QVC and those e-commerce companies; rationalization of the public assets that we view as non-core to Liberty Interactive on an efficient basis; and, opportunistic acquisitions in new ventures like the things we’re doing at Lockerz and the in the Right Start. And at Liberty Starz, which as I mentioned was unaffected by changes in this attribution, we’re going to focus on operational execution and building cost effective programming, including originals to differentiate the channels for the benefit of our consumers. And we’re going to determine the effective uses of the large cash balances and borrowing capacity at Liberty Starz. And lastly, at Liberty Capital we look forward to continued growth at Sirius XM and Live Nation. We’ll focus on rationalizing the non-core holdings that are there. And we’ll again look at effective use of capital, reducing debt, shrinking equity, opportunistic investments in both debt and equity. We appreciate your continued interest in Liberty. I recognize particularly this quarter with the attribution it may take more work to stay involved, but we hope we\'re making it clear, cleaner, and better for you. And with that, stay tuned. Thank you for listening. I’ll turn it to the operator and open up the question. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from David Gober – Morgan Stanley. David Gober – Morgan Stanley Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. One big picture question for Greg, and one on Liberty Starz, hopefully, for Chris. On the big picture question, in terms re- attribution, it seems like almost of the Liberty Media LLC, parent company debt is now at LINTA still a little bit left with LCAP.A. Is there any consideration here that longer term, this makes it easier for either Liberty Interactive of other pieces to be hard spun? And I guess longer term, Greg, what’s your view on the tracking stock structure? Do you think it’s more loss of permanent contract? And then on Liberty Starz, I’m just curious if Chris could give us an update on the Disney relationship and any changes there, and how you view the Netflix distribution as well. Greg Maffei So I’ll go first. And you’re right to note that almost all of the LM LLC debt is now in LINT, exception to that being the Time Warner exchangeables, which have a 2013 put in caller relationship, and are – just to be clear for those, are more than adequately covered in value by the underlying stock we own in TWX, TWC, and AOL. So when in fact you can think of those in our minds as we do as the fees by the underlying equity value. It’s not a tactical decision, but a practical decision. Whether the long term structure – the trackers is the perfect one, I think we\'ve always said or I’ve said that the trackers offer a lot of flexibility, tax advantages, and a bunch of other advantages in thinking about our business. But they\'re unlikely to be the structure that yields the highest value of the assets. So while there may be benefits in the interim and in for some period in having a tracking stock structure, which we obviously believe because we have it, ultimately, to get full value for an asset, you are likely to need to put it in a condition of an asset-backed security. And you\'ve seen our strategy heretofore has been in effect to do that. Looking back over now six years, we spun off LMI and credit Liberty Global. We spun off the Discovery holdings, created Discovery Communications, free standing any – we\'ve spun off our (inaudible) item and merger with DirectTV, all those great flexibility. Whether that means that we break these trackers or ultimately spin other assets away, we have no plans today. But building flexibility, understanding that ultimately we need to put assets in our shareholders hands to get flexibility, that’s part of our goal. Chris Albrecht With regard to your first question– Greg Maffei I\'ll pass it to Chris Albrecht. Thanks. Chris Albrecht Yes. With regard to your first question about Disney, Starz has enjoyed a long and successful relationship with Disney. We’re in discussions actively about continuing that relationship well into the future. And we have every reason to be confident that we will be able to do that with an arrangement that closely mirrors the current situation. With regard to NetFlix, is that the second question? David Gober – Morgan Stanley Yes. Chris Albrecht We think it extremely important to continue to try to expand the distribution partners for the Starz and Encore networks. New Media “partners” are certainly opportunities that exist presently and in the future. At the same time, we need to make sure that whatever agreements we have with them are taken into account, and protect and respect the long term historical relationships that we have with our traditional distributors and suppliers. And I think it would be honest to say that the current agreement could be improved with regard to that and as we look forward to continuing our relationship with NetFlix or any new media partners. We’re going to focus very heavily on the big picture. David Gober – Morgan Stanley And I guess because you mentioned earlier distribution partners, I\'m just curious if you could update us on some of the agreements that were scheduled to expire or maybe are still month-to-month like the Comcast Encore piece and the Time Warner Cable arrangements, which I think were up at the end of ’09. Chris Albrecht Yes, we are in very productive discussions with Comcast. And I think there is a real willingness on both sides to ensure that that relationship continues contractually, again, well into the future not just for carriage of the network, but for the marketing and monetization of that relationship. With regard to Time Warner, I’m hopeful that the many strong relationships that we all have with management at Time Warner Cable will allow us to be able to get into a much more productive relationship with them. And I think it’s a real opportunity for both companies, obviously for us. But at the same time, the premier television business is one where we only make money if the operators are making money, so there a mutually beneficial opportunity here. And we are talking to Time Warner Cable, and I think those discussions will hopefully heat up and increase their intensity over the next couple of weeks. David Gober – Morgan Stanley Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question is from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Thanks so much. I have a couple of questions. First, Greg, I was just hoping to clarify the balance sheet for LCAP or so. I’m not sure we can do this in this call, but let’s give it a shot. So you reported a face value of debt in your press release at 12/31 of $4.22 billion, and $1.4 billion of that went over to LINTA, and $838 million of that is related to Sprint caller, which is going to unwind between now and July, so it seems like that really that debt levels of pro forma of $2 billion. And you reported $3.2 billion in cash. And you\'ve got– Greg Maffei Well, let’s stop there. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Okay. Greg Maffei I’ve got a couple of people who are much more knowledgeable than I am in the room, thank goodness. But I think about it this way, our – we\'ve got the exchangeable debt that is being moved across obviously eliminated. You\'ve got the exchangeable debt remaining behind, which is the Time Warner exchangeables, which I mentioned already in our view covered by the Time Warner underlying stock – Time Warner family underlying stocks, both PWC, and AOL, and TWX itself. You have the $750 million facility we have with Deutsche Bank, which is a – for accounting purposes is really that\'s fully drawn, but as a practical matter I believe we have about $340 million of it drawn today. And that is offset on the asset side by sub-debt and senior debt in TMT companies that we\'ve invested in. And we have a positive – not only a positive carry, but we are more than covered by the gains in the investments we\'ve made against that debt. So in my mind, that is effectively covered. Obviously, the world could change subjected – we could do. We owe that money. But that’s effectively covered as well. And then, you\'ve got the Sprint caller and which were borrowed – which we borrowed against, if you may recall, because we wanted to ensure our liability against certain financial institutions, Doug. And so that money is effectively covered as well because the caller is actually larger than the underlying borrowings. That is the – other than some minor pieces of – I think we have the money up and we\'ve gone up in Canada, some minor pieces on Starz Media. That is effectively the debt of Liberty Capital. Those three groupings are – there’s under $100 million of other debt. I think it’s 50-ish, right, Chris? Correct me. Chris Shean It\'s $150 million. Greg Maffei $150 million? Other than that, other than those. Chris Shean There’s $838 million on the caller loan. The investment fund facility is $750 million. And of course some of that money is sitting in restricted cash, over half of it. And then, a little over $1.1 billion Time Warner debt, and then the $150 million other. Greg Maffei So excuse me, $150 million of other. I was a little light there. I apologize. $150 of others, that’s really – the $150 million of other, in my mind, is the non-deceived, non-covered portion of the debt at Liberty Capital. Go ahead, Doug. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank All right. So we\'ve got essentially almost virtually no debt at Liberty Capital pro forma. I\'d have to adjust my assets a little bit, but that’s fine. And the cash that you reported $2.2 billion, you obviously have some cash going out the door. But you also have $158 million coming in from QVC. And you still have the WildBlue cash coming in, correct? So essentially pro forma cash around $2.7 billion. Greg Maffei WildBlue cash is in. WildBlue cash is in the – you have other cash, which will become again – which as we noted that the Liberty Interactive will pay – will repay its loans to Liberty Capital. What that down is $135 million, is that right? $158 million, excuse me. Good then we have people to keep me on it, $158 million. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Okay. So you essentially have $2.5 billion of pro forma cash and virtually no debt because your debt\'s covered by assets. And I guess, I’m just– Greg Maffei Go ahead, Chris. Chris Shean It’s important to know that there is about $400 million plus of restricted cash from that investment fund facility that\'s sitting in other assets. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Understood. Greg Maffei So the point to make here is when you take the $400 million and the sub-debt, right, it covers the – that covers the $750 million. The way I think about it that was really – we\'ve only – utilizing $340 million, and the assets cover that. There is a complete match between the drawn debt and the restricted cash for the balance. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Understood again. So you virtually have no debt at LCAP pro forma, all these assets allocations. You have $2.5 billion of cash. So what level of cash now with re-attributions changes that you\'ve made to – you need to have it LCAP? How much would you reserve excess cash? And what’s the plan in terms of the share purchases versus – (inaudible) than others. Greg Maffei I think the liabilities other than the debt that we have there are really tax liabilities. Now we significantly reduced pro forma, the tax liabilities for Liberty Capital, with this transaction because all of the tax liabilities related to the early retirement of certain Sprint exchangeables back in 2009, or the future, or the other future productions already taken, that is now Liberty Interactive, so just looking at Liberty Capital for a second, significantly reduced tax liabilities. Tax liabilities fall into two categories broadly, one is related to the Sprint derivative and the shore against the box there. And the other is the gain in Sirius. I do not believe it is likely that we will trigger the gain in Sirius. There is virtually no scenario I can think of that my chairman would let me even talk about doing that. So you’re talking about something we’re either likely to, somewhere down the road, find another way to get liquidity in Sirius or become a purchaser of Sirius. And I think we\'ve talked about that in the past. So it’s a logical alternative. So you’re left with looking at the other liabilities that might come due, and we obviously need to keep some cash balance on that. And you’re looking at what else we might invest in over time, and that’s really our choices as I mentioned, investing in our own equity; investing in our debt, which would mean effectively the Time Warner debt in this case; investing in other company’s debt, another company’s equity. We obviously think our equity is attractive. But I would note some of the other investments we\'ve made have turned out pretty attractively as well, like Sirius. So I’m not going to pre-judge which way we’re going to go with any of that money. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank All right. And then the question for Chris, and it follows my peers. But thanks for the question, but just quickly, Starz outlook for OIBITDA in 2010, any sense? Obviously, people are certainly nervous that TV spending could take away from the core OIBITDA growth of the business. Can you give us any sense of where you think 2010 will come out? Chris Albrecht Sure. As we\'ve said or as Bill read, we think we’re well positioned for 2010. And we certainly expect to meet the targets that we\'ve set for ourselves. There is a unique challenge of the need to invest in additional original content to help position the network, both with the affiliates and with the consumer, and we intend to do that. But at the same time, we do not want to negatively impact the P&L growth that we\'ve predicted. So we are actively working on innovative message to be able to increase the amount of spending that we can handle on the original side and accomplish both goals. And we are confident that we’re going to be able to ramp up at the scale that we need to with the kind of programming that’s going to be important for the continued health and growth of Starz Entertainment, and at the same time, detect and potentially even improve the things that we’re projecting. Greg Maffei Glenn Curtis is the CFO of Starz, as you know. Glenn, you might just reiterate what we’re – what Chris says what we\'ve said, or reiterate – he\'s endorsing what we\'ve said. What are we talking about projecting for growth next year, this year 2010? Glenn Curtis Yes, we\'ve previously had said on call that 5% to 10% was the range that we gave. Chris Shean And free cash flow. Greg Maffei And OIBITDA growth. And we\'re still comfortable with those numbers. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question is from James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Chris, a couple for you. I mean you clearly – at HBO, you were known for driving original content. Can you talk more about how much original content you think Starz really need to have, particularly it sounds like for the shutdown of Crash here at one-hour long drama? Do you expect that you\'ll be replacing that going forward? Chris Albrecht Sure. The job of programming, any of these premium services, I think is to create value and also differentiation from the other entries in the category. I never felt that the pay-TV game – with the ratings game is really more and attitudinal gain with the subscribers and with the operators. So we intend to have the year-long presence in original programming. And we\'re talking about working on having a brand that feels cohesive with the other pieces of the network on the theatrical side. And I would expect that while it will take a little while, these things just don\'t grow in trees, ramp up to the full complement of what we\'re expecting to do. I think between series and mini-series type events or other forms of long form programming, we\'ll have a full complement hopefully by the end of 2011. And as I said before, we expect to be able to do that with some innovative financing method so that we can continue to meet our growth targets. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital And at HBO, you were part of a much larger portfolio of cable content assets. Can you talk about the plusses and minuses of Starz essentially being a stand-alone? Chris Albrecht Well, I think they would be what you would expect. On one hand, you don\'t have to worry that there\'s someone else who is mocking up the relationship with the distributors or content suppliers that you\'re going to have to be drawn into. At the same time, it would be fair to say that a stand-alone operation has some challenges in terms of leveraging other strengths with distributors. Having said that, I think the most important thing for us now is to create a vibrant brand for the Starz network. Encore\'s a terrific product that the distributors and the consumers enjoy and like very much, so. We feel very good about that. And I think if we can take Starz and make it the network that we planned, we\'re going to have the appropriate leverage and the appropriate relationships with the necessary suppliers and distributors. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital Thank you. Operator And our next question from Bridget Weishaar from J.P. Morgan. Bridget Weishaar – J.P. Morgan Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to clarify this re-attribution and its impact on the Liberty Interactive. So my understanding is cash flow increased by $807 million. That will increase by $1.4 million. The Live Nation asset will be eliminated. And the part I\'m confused then is you have that $830 million in net taxable income that resulted from the cancellation. Can you just explain exactly how that got generated and how we should recognize it on the financial statements? Chris Shean We retired in 2009 some of the Sprint exchangeable debentures. There was both EOD income and prior tax liability for deductions taken, i.e. interest deductions taken larger than cash payments made, it\'s under the new tax loss that were adopted in 2009, caused those to be recognized over a five-year period. And so that is how we get the numbers we\'re showing out in future years we expect to be taking in that taxable income. Okay? In years 2014 to 2018 because the – under the – some of the law changes that were related to the stimulus package. They extended that period for five years. You got a holiday. And then you recognize your COD and related income over a five-year period. One that\'s worth noting is that this will even be cash flow positive in those years because the interest deductions taken in those years will be larger than the taxable income generated. Because these Sprint exchangeable debentures and Moto exchangeable debentures that are being transferred or re-attributed across have that feature, they will actually generate tax deductions, i.e. interest deductions larger than cash interest paid, in excess of the amount being recognized here, the $830 million being recognized over the five years. So I don\'t think from a cash flow it will still be negative. Bridget Weishaar – J.P. Morgan Okay. And then, how will that be recognized on the financial statements now? What impact would it have? Greg Maffei Well basically, a lot of these – these liabilities are already reflected in deferred taxes. And so, we haven\'t running – I guess in the first quarter, you\'ll see the movement of the balance sheets accounts amongst the tracking stock groups. But you\'ll see movements in deferred taxes from one group to the other. Bridget Weishaar – J.P. Morgan Okay. And then, one last quick clarification, the GSI and the low vote IC, you said that it generated $220 million in cash. Is that recognized for Q1 to a mix? Can you give me any indication? Greg Maffei GSI, was it $220 million? (inaudible) And IC was – Bill, you have the numbers? Bill Myers Just over $50 million. Greg Maffei In Q1, recognized that we\'ve been selling – in prior periods, in Q4 and the like, we\'ve sold more. In Q1, it\'s $50 million, which obviously won\'t be recognized until we report the Q1 financials. Bridget Weishaar – J.P. Morgan Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question is from Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, on Q3, you had a grade impact on new customer activity at Direct and Dish from the channel repositionings. And it looked like that probably accounted for a disproportion in the amount of the benefit in that quarter. Q4 was so strong. I assume you were probably good across the board with most of the MSOs. And given that and how attractive people find QVC once they sample it, would you be tempted to do another campaign paralleling what you did with IBO on 1Q? That\'s my first question. And the second question is World Space. It looks there are a number of angles you could take with that. And then thirdly, I too got a little confused on some of the shifting. Does the full $830 million on the movement of deferred taxes happen right away on the balance sheet between respective trackers? Chris Shean Yes. Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities Okay. Great. Greg Maffei And it\'s just the last question. Chris, do you want to talk about – excuse me, Mike, you want to talk about QVC? And then, I\'ll come back and talk a little bit about World Space. Mike George Sure. When you look at the strong new name growth in Q4, it attributed three or four primary factors. Number one is we just put out a set of product offerings that really appeal to new customers. Keep in mind that at any given point in time, we have 10, 9 customers watching QVC for every customer watching QVC. So when we get it just right and get the right kind of products that have high appeal to new names as we did in Q4, you can really explosive growth without any additional advertising or other support, just by people coming by the channel. That\'s the number one driver. And number two driver, I do think we\'ve been helped the good work of our affiliate team in improving our channel positioning in DirecTV and EcoStar, Dish as well as getting us more HD placement. We\'re up to 25-plus million HD SUBs. So then a number of things to improve the quality of our real estate on the TV dial. And I think the third factor is we have never in our history had the level of publicity, buzz, PR coverage around what we\'re doing as we had in Q4. And so, we aim to keep up all three of those. I certainly can\'t promise that we\'ll get the kind of growth we got in Q4. But we feel good about our ability to attract new names. I wouldn\'t think of that necessarily as an expensive paid advertising campaign. I think for us, we\'re finding that combination of get the right products out there, continue to optimize channel positioning. And then, drive energy, excitement around the brand. A lot of it was unpaid media, basically buzz. But also, continuing to optimize paid search, continuing to optimize natural search, doing some forms of graph marketing, all those things coming together to help us sustain that kind of growth in new customers. Greg Maffei On World Space, we\'re – it\'s an evolving relationship. We are currently a lender to World Space, to the debt in possession (inaudible) because we purchased a loan as a percentage of debt financing to that. We had discussions about a broader relationship that are not yet resolved. Our interest in that – and frankly, it\'s somewhat of a venture capital-type play. It could take several forms. We obviously like satellite radio. We think it\'s a great property. Could there be opportunities for satellite radio outside the United States? We\'re certainly looking at that. In addition, World Space has L-Band spectrum in virtually every place in the world, except the US, Japan, and South Korea. And it\'s got a couple of satellites in the air that might be of value. Our views, our plans are evolving. Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Bazinet – Citi Thanks. I apologize if I missed this in the flurry of numbers you gave out. But as of the third quarter, at least I have $2.178 billion of net deferred tax liabilities at LCAP.A. Did you say how much that deferred liability is going down as a result of the transfer? Chris Shean We did not say that. But it\'s going down about roughly $1.1 billion. Jason Bazinet – Citi $1.1 billion. Okay. Chris Shean But keep in mind that deferred tax number is not a discounted number. For GAAP, deferred taxes are reported at their gross basis, different stands, whatever the expected and active tax rates, whereas the actual economics of this transaction were evaluated on a present value basis. Jason Bazinet – Citi So there are four. When you go through all of those– Greg Maffei We\'re looking at these numbers – Liberty Capital in effect got paid for the discounted value of those futures options. And you have this perversity where Liberty Interactive is booking deferred taxes due a great deal – the bulk of which is due in 2029 and \'31 on its balance sheet today. And that\'s obviously a non-discounted, non-present value liability. Chris Shean And as a result of that, Jason, once we reflect these numbers through the tracking stock schedules, there\'ll be a pretty large movement from book equity from one tracker to the other, and the difference is largely due to this – the fair value, if you will, of deferred taxes versus book value. Jason Bazinet – Citi Is another way of saying that the numbers that are reported on the financials when you say gross basis is it doesn\'t reflect the time value of money? Is that the way to think about it? Greg Maffei That is absolutely– Chris Shean That is absolutely correct. Jason Bazinet – Citi Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And next, we\'ll go to Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Thank you. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could comment a bit more about the Live Nation investment. In particular, you guys have described this as an investment. I just wanted to clarify, of all of the things that you could put money into that you have available to you out there, your view is that Live Nation is the best or were other – some strategic or secular things that\'s your view to do that, perhaps something in conjunction with your stake in Sirius. Greg Maffei When you put it that way, is it the best possible thing we could with the money, that\'s the high bar. We obviously think that it\'s an attractive investment among the alternatives. We think that the merger in which have – the merged company in which we already had just under a 15% stake is attractively positioned, and owning more of it is a positive, whether there are more strategic things that down the road we can do in the music space, now that\'s the glorious dream. We have assets which have – and relationships with companies at various points that have a lot to do with music, starting with Sirius XM, but even going to DirecTV, which we have no obvious economic tie today, but we have pretty good relations with, and they\'re important for other music. Whether those kinds of things evolve, that\'s the glorious future. I wouldn\'t on that. We\'d like that. But we look at the numbers that they\'re producing on their own, I think it\'s pretty. Mark Carlton who\'s in the room is on the Board of the merged company, maybe you could comment, Mark. Mark Carlton No, I think we definitely like the business. We love the management team that they have in place and what their opportunities are. And we think what they\'re going to be able to put forth together is great for music fans. It should help drive the business as well. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Okay. Great. And then on – turning to Sirius, you commented about the option to either spinning off – with avoiding the tax liability or purchasing Sirius. But Sirius, obviously, has taken a huge leg up just in the past few weeks. And with another track – with another investment you guys have at HSM when that stock landed, it did get to a point where you started to suggest that perhaps it was pricier than your appetite lies. Is Sirius at that level or can you even go there and comment on that? I know it\'s a year ahead of the standstill. But can you comment on your Sirius value now? Greg Maffei I think the comparison is just a little bit false in the sense that on the HSN one, we said that with the comp, a better performing, stronger comp. And while we like the HSN, we have one called QVC, which outperforms it and it\'s undervalued compared to it. Well it\'s hard to look and say, "Jeez, today, our best use of capital will be putting more money in HSN versus more money in QVC given the relative performance and the relative valuation." In the case of Sirius, there is nothing out there like it. It has a unique position, obviously, in satellite radio. But it also has a relatively unique position about being a scaled media company, which is growing at an enormous rate, well good top line growth and excellent bottom line growth through synergies related to the merger and opportunities around that. So what\'s fair value on that is a lot harder to calculate because there\'s nothing out there, as I said, like it. And there\'s nothing out there that is growing as quickly. They reported a number this morning, the flip that they had in operating losses from 2008 to operating income in 2009. It was over $900 million swing. That\'s a pretty good run. I don\'t think – no one\'s quite predicting that big a number for next year. But it also still has a – is forecasted for very good growth, again, above anything else in the media space. So it\'s a little harder to make the call. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Okay. And then one final question, just turning to Starz, I think you said in the discussion of revenues that there was some benefit from non-affiliate piece versus I think sales and programming perhaps, either at networks DVD sales. I was wondering if you can give us any sense of the quantification of that. And then, Chris, if you – obviously, HBO did great with this or has been great with it. What\'s the opportunity to ramp up more this type of revenue at Starz? Greg Maffei Let me just stop Chris and say, we are not making public to scale yet some materials of the overall business yet. But we\'re not making scale yet to public of both ancillary revenue sources. Obviously, it\'s an area that we think has opportunity. And I\'ll let Chris pick up on how he thinks that\'s working out in the future. Chris Albrecht I think the opportunity for Starz to grow revenue off of the content businesses will come primarily from being able to distribute that content in other areas. That felt for a while that it\'s probably not as important to outright own the IP as it might have been – as people might have thought in the past. At HBO, we certainly grew a very large driver off of the original content that was put on the network. But it was a different time, different opportunities, different realities in some of the ancillary markets. So we want to fund this in an innovative way that\'s going to allow us to retain some valuable off Starz distribution rates. But at the same time, our primary goal is to make sure that we\'re investing the appropriate amount of money to help the networks, and ancillary revenue off of those products is not the primary driver of our investment. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Okay. Greg Maffei Great. So operator, with that, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We\'ve gone more than an hour. But I guess we had a fair amount of stuff to cover today. And thank you all for your continued interest in Liberty Media. And we\'ll talk to you next quarter, not before. Operator This concludes Liberty Media Corporation quarterly earnings conference call. Thank you for attending, and have a good day.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Maffei. Gregory Maffei Good morning and thank you to all out on the call for joining us today and for your continued interest in Liberty Media. Today, we’ll review the year and the quarter by tracker. We’ll discuss the operating performance at our controlled subsidiaries. We’ll cover transactions and other development.  Liberty’s Controller Chris Shean will discuss the attributed businesses financial performance and liquidity picture for each of those and QVC’s CEO Mike George will discuss operating developments and results at QVC. Starz CEO Chris Albrecht will review recent events there at Starz. Also on the call today we have QVC’s CFO Dan O’Connell, Starz Entertainment President, Bill Meyers, Starz’ CFO Glenn Curtis and several other assembled Liberty senior executives. We’ll all be available for questions after the prepared remarks. Looking at the first quarter, in general we had excellent and continued momentum from what we experienced in Q4. At Liberty Interactive, QVC experienced a good first quarter with top tier retail revenue results and industry-leading revenue results among home shopping networks.  We continued to expand our margins and we continue to drive internet adaptation and evolution of the business with U.S. QVC.com growing about 24% year over year and globally dot com revenue growing about 23% year over year. Our e-commerce companies posted 10% revenue growth despite a change in our non-transaction revenue programs that reduced revenue and more dramatically, impacted adjusted OIBIDA. Chris Shean will talk a little bit more about that in detail in a moment. At Liberty Interactive, we continue to clarify the story, continue to enhance liquidity by selling our shares in Via Sat, GSI and our logoed shares in IAC. We also extended maturities with issuances of $500 million tranches of seven-year bonds and ten-year bonds. We used some of that liquidity for our recently announced Dutch Option Tender for $4 million of our senior debt, senior notes maturing in 2013. At Liberty Starz, we had good revenue and adjusted OIBIDA results despite a lack of significant CPI adjusters and a programming write down that Chris Albrecht will discuss in a little more detail. We were very pleased with the response to Spartacus throughout the 13 weeks. I think the script got stronger and the audience grew and was strong. It’s a good example of what exclusive, original programming can do, and we see the positive results in the sequential trend in subscribers that is at least partially a result of that. There’s a virtuous push/pull cycle with our distribution partners being more apt to feature us because of original programming like Spartacus and our end use consumers being more apt to ask for us because of original programming like Spartacus. We’re working on the development new and exciting series. Perhaps you’ve read or heard about our coming debut of Pillars of the Earth which will be on in July, the gripping historical novel that was an Oprah Book Club selection and sold over 15 million copies. We think it’s going to be a great event for our Starz subscribers this summer. At Liberty Capital, Sirius XM posted very strong financial results driven by good operating performance including 171,000 net adds, churn falling down to 2%, being reduced to 2%, and increased conversion, particularly at some of our growing partners on the audio side. Despite the market correction of the last few days, we have very strong gains there and remain very excited about the business and its opportunities going forward. We’re also excited about the opportunities for and the stock performance of Live Nation. While we had mixed results for our tender, garnering a little less than 1% of the 34 million shares that we sought, it’s a typical Liberty story in that we were somewhat pleased with the 35% to 40% stock price increase because we already own 15% of the stock. We continued the share repurchase at Liberty Capital, buying back about $87 million worth of stock from January 30 to April 30, and as you may have read in the release, we re-upped for another $500 million of held cap share repurchase authorization approval by our Board. So with that, let me turn it over to Chris Shean and let him talk first about the financial results. Christopher Shean Liberty Interactive Group’s revenue increased 11% to $2 billion in the first quarter while adjusted OIBIDA increased 12% to $381 million. QVC is the primary driver of results among the Liberty Interactive attributed assets, had a strong quarter and its total revenue increased 11% to $1.8 billion while adjusted OIBIDA increased 15% to $366 million. Liberty Interactive’s other e-commerce businesses grew 10% for the quarter. Almost each company, posted an increase in revenue. However, overall revenue growth was partially offset by lower commission revenue earned when customers sign up for third party online discount services. During the quarter, a decision was made to change the way these promotions are offered which reduced the revenue earned in the quarter. These changes are expected to continue to adversely impact commission revenue throughout 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our e-commerce businesses earned revenue from this commission of approximately $32 million. Adjusted OIBIDA for the e-commerce businesses decreased 33% for the first quarter and represented almost 7% of revenue as compared to 11% in the prior year period. Revenue earned from the commissions had significantly higher margins than product sales; therefore, the reduction in this revenue more negatively impacted adjusted OIBIDA on a percentage basis. Additionally in the first quarter, more costs were incurred associated with our two start-ups, Lockers and Rite Start, which had very little related revenue at this point. These negative impacts offset the product related adjusted OIBIDA growth that was achieved by our e-commerce businesses. Let’s take a quick look at the LINTA liquidity picture. At the end of the first quarter, the group had attributed cash and public investments of $4.6 billion while it had $7.6 billion in attributed debt.  QVC access to the bond market in the first quarter and issued two series of senior notes with a total principal of around $1 billion. They used the net proceeds to purchase and cancel term loans under its senior secured credit facilities that matured in 2010, ’11 and ’14.  Additionally during the first quarter, Liberty Interactive repaid the full intergroup loan balances to both Liberty Capital and Liberty Starz. On April 30, an additional $159 million bank debt due to mature later in June of 2010 was purchased, leaving $16 million of outstanding bank debt due in the second quarter. Now with that, I’ll hand the call over to Mike George, who will provide more insights into QVC. Michael George Thank you, Chris. We were delighted with our results in the quarter. We were able to drive strong increases in revenues and adjusted OIBIDA as you heard from Chris. We continue gaining share against the broader retail market and sustain the strong momentum we saw in the back half of last year. We grew revenue 11% companywide with particularly strong performance in the U.S. and Japan. We continue to see outstanding growth in our e-commerce platform with global e-commerce revenues of $476 million, up 23% from Q1 of ’09. In addition, we continue to add new customers at a strong rate with worldwide new customer count up 10% and revenue growth from new customers up 18%. Our adjusted OIBIDA grew 15% on a 90 basis point improvement in OIBIDA margins, driven by strong gains in overall product margins, and improvement in warehouse and freight productivity. Excluding the impact of our Italy start us, OIBIDA margins were up over 100 basis points. With that overview, I’ll walk through the results in each market. In the U.S., we increased revenue 10%. Our beauty, accessories, consumer electronics and kitchen and floor care businesses were especially strong. Our initiatives to building the leading e-commerce business continued to pay off with QVC.com hosted 24% revenue growth in the U.S. In the quarter, e-commerce represented 32% of our U.S. revenue, up three points from Q1 of last year. We also continue to add new customers in the U.S. at a strong pace. In Q1, our new customer count grew 15% and revenue from new customers increased 26%, our second higher quarterly increase in over a decade, topped only by Q4’s strong growth. Our return rate did increase from 18% to 18.6%, although this is primarily a reflection of adjustments we made in Q1 of last year to true up our accruals with our actual experience. Excluding the impact of those adjustments, our return rate increased just 10 basis points. We grew adjusted OIBIDA 19% driven primarily by 130 basis point improvement in product margins and strong gains in warehouse and freight efficiencies.  Turning to the U.K., revenue growth was flat in local currency, a reversal of the improving sales momentum we have seen through most of 2009. We saw strong growth in our fashion, beauty and arts and crafts businesses, offset by softer results in fine jewelry and consumer electronics. In hindsight, we were probably too focused on bringing down inventory levels in Q4, and didn’t have enough product and programming ammunition to get our goals in Q1. The team recognized the issue early in the quarter and began taking the necessary steps to improve results and we do expect to see better performance throughout the year. Adjusted OIBIDA declined 7% in local currency driven by an increase in the obsolescence rate, partially offset by improved operating costs. The increase in the obsolescence provision is largely due to timing issues, which should normalize over the course of the year. In Germany, growth also slowed with revenue in local currency increasing 2%. Most of our businesses actually performed quite well with particular strength in health and beauty, accessories, consumer electronics, small appliances and home textiles. However, our jewelry business was difficult. In an effort to turn that business around, we took jewelry off the air completely for the last three weeks of March so that we could r-launch it on April 1 with fresh product, packaging and programming. While this severally impacted results in the month, we thought it was the right move to strengthen our jewelry business for the long term. Adjusted OIBIDA declined 1% in local currency due to 120 basis point erosion in gross profit driven by a mix shift to consumer electronics and slightly higher liquidation activity, partially offset by strong gains in variable cost center productivity and lower fixed costs. In Japan, revenue grew 13% in local currency, an outstanding result especially in light of the continued economic challenges in that market. The healthy, beauty and fashion businesses were particularly strong. Our Japan business has gained momentum for three consecutive quarters and we’re encouraged by both the strong sales growth with existing customers and our success introducing new customers to the business. E-commerce revenue growth was particularly strong, up 25% to 22% of total sales. We continue to see strong usage of mobile devices in Japan, which now represent close to half of all e-commerce revenue. Adjusted OIBIDA grew 20% in local currency driven by 100 basis point improvement in product margins and productivity gains in our warehouse and call center.  In Italy, we had a $4 million adjusted OIBIDA loss, as we began to staff up for our launch later this year. As we previously announced, we anticipate an OIBIDA loss in Italy for the full year of $30 million to $40 million. We continue to make good progress on our start up plans and remain on track for an October launch to roughly 17 million homes in Italy. Collectively, our international operations grew adjusted OIBIDA 8% in U.S. dollars in the first quarter. If we normalize for the losses associated with the Italy start up costs, international adjusted OIBIDA would have grown 11%, and total company OIBIDA would have increased 16% without Italy versus the 15% we reported. We believe the strong gains in revenue and OIBIDA and market share and e-commerce penetration and in new customers, reflects the success of our continued efforts to create a new kind of shopping experience founded on exclusive compelling product and programming content, a leading multi-media platform and outstanding customer service. On the content side, highlights in the U.S. in the quarter included our most expensive fashion week programming to date and a major red carpet event live from Las Angeles in conjunction with the Academy Awards, the rollout of our new Isaac Mizrahi lifestyle brand that premiered in December, several successful brand and product launches including a new Susie Orman product line, Jillian Michaels products for the We Fit, Steve [McKowski] footwear complimenting his highly successful handbag line, Kim Kardasian’s premier fragrance, Vita Mix blenders and Dyson vacuums. On the platform side, in addition to our strong overall e-commerce growth, we see continued strong interest in our I phone app and over the next six to eight weeks, we will be rolling an enhanced app with live streaming and other features as well as complimentary apps for the Android and Blackberry platforms. We also launched a desktop widget to alert customers to our today’s special value and other promotions and later this year, we will roll out our new global e-commerce platform to our markets in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, which we expect will further bolster our strong e-commerce performance. We also continue to strengthen our TV platform. In the U.S. our HD roll out continues and we’re now up to about 32 million homes. And two weeks ago, we announced an exciting partnership with ITV, the U.K.’s largest commercial television network. Beginning in late May, QVC will be simulcast on ITV 1, their flagship channel for 27 minutes segments between midnight and 2:00 a.m. for a total of six hours a week. Through this partnership, we’ll be able to expose QVC to millions of potential new customers and also create an additional tune in opportunity on a highly trafficked channel for our existing customers. And with that, I’ll turn it back Chris. Christopher Shean Now we’ll look at Liberty Starz. Liberty Starz attributed revenue grew 3% in the first quarter to $307 million while adjusted OIBIDA decreased 1% to $103 million. At quarter end, Liberty Starz had attributed cash, and public holdings of $1 billion and attributed debt of only $47 million.  From January 30 through April 30, Liberty repurchased 540 thousand shares of Liberty Starz class A common stock at an average price of $47.40 for a total cash consideration of $26 million. Now with that, Chris Albrecht will comment on events at Starz Entertainment and Media. Chris Albrecht Starz had a very solid quarter with three particularly notable achievements. After four quarters of declines, subscriber numbers for both Starz and Encore resumed an upward trajectory in the quarter. Our original series Spartacus Blood and Sand achieved excellent ratings throughout its first season as Greg mentioned and we extended our output agreement with the Walt Disney company for three additional years. On the financial front, Starz Entertainment posted revenue of $305 million in the quarter, which was an increase of 3% over the same period a year ago. One-third of the revenue increase resulted from higher effective rates and the rest from growth in the weighted average number of subscriptions. First quarter OIBIDA of $106 million was slightly below the prior year figure, but was impacted by an impairment charge of $4 million related to the second season of Crash and also by a marketing expense of Spartacus in the quarter. Versus fourth quarter of 2009, subscriber numbers grew among affiliates as the impact of the economic downturn seems to be abating, and while Starz added 168,000 subscribers during the quarter, boosting its total to 17.1 million, Encore also added 565,000 customers to total 31.1 million at the end of March. Both numbers are still below the comparative figures a year ago, but revenue was not negatively impacted because the decreases were attributable to reduction in subscription units covered by fixed rate agreements, which don’t impact revenue. Now the success of Spartacus exceeded all of our expectations. Driven by positive critical reviews and effective marketing, weekend audience size increased by 67% from its premier on January 22 all the way through its finale 13 weeks later, and the number of people recording the show on DVR’s for later viewing more than doubled during that time. As Greg said, the show was the number rated Friday night program in all of cable TV for seven of its final eight weeks. For many people around the country, Spartacus put Starz on the map, and the same is true in other nations, as we’ve experienced strong interest among broadcasters worldwide seeking to bring Spartacus to their viewers. In March, as many of you might know we received the sad news that our talented young star of Spartacus, Andy Whitfield, had been diagnosed with a treatable form on non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, and that would require several months of treatment and recuperation. This has forced us to delay the production of the second season of Spartacus. With the success of Spartacus, we’ve begun to ramp our original strategy. In the first quarter, we announced the acquisition of U.S. pay TV rights for the eight episode series, Pillars of the Earth based on the worldwide bestselling book by Ken Follett. The series stars Ian McShane, Donald Sutherland, Chris Sewell and will premier on July 23. And most recently, we announced plans to air a new original series Camelot, for which we will retain all U.S. rights including premium television, digital and home entertainment. What may be most interesting about these three series is not their similarity in genre, but their difference in financing structure. Spartacus, we produced entirely ourselves and we retain all rights worldwide. Pillars on the other hand, with a simple acquisition of domestic pay TV rights, and Camelot will be a co-production with Graham King’s new production company and the rights will be split between the two of us. Going forward, we’re looking at several new projects in a variety of different genres and with a variety of different financing models. We’ll be looking for shows that increase the value our customers and affiliates place on Starz and that raise our brand recognition. Our goal within the next few years will be to have as many as four original series and four miniseries airing on Starz annually. Finally, the new agreement with Disney, will give us continued to a key ingredient in our content mix. Under the three-year extension, Starz will continue to have exclusive rights to distribute Disney films on all our platforms during the pay TV window through 2015. On the Starz media front, revenue for the quarter increased to $144 million from $102 million in the same period last year while OIBDA moved from a positive $5 million to a negative $7 million. These shifts were largely due to the timing of the theatrical and home video releases from Overture Films. We continue to examine strategic alternatives to the ownership structure of Overture Films and other Starz media companies and we will report to you when and if those bear fruit. Thank, and back to you Chris. Christopher Shean Let’s take a quick look at Liberty Capital. During the quarter, Liberty Capital revenue increased 33% to $166 million which adjusted OIBIDA decreased by $11 million. The Liberty Capital Group has attributed cash and public investments of $8.2 billion and attributed debt of $2.4 billion. From January 30 through April 30, 2010, Liberty repurchased 2.2 million shares of L Cap A common stock at an average price of $40.18 for a total cash consideration of $87 million. Cumulative repurchased since the reclassification of the tracker represent 28% of the shares outstanding. With that said, I’ll turn the call back over to Greg for closing remarks. Gregory Maffei Thank you, Chris and thank you to Mike and Chris for updates on your respective businesses. As I think I noted earlier, we feel good about our Q1 results. All of our businesses with a few minor challenges here and there are performing well.  The major priorities for the rest of the year as we look forward are; at Liberty Interactive to maintain the strong operating performance at QVC and drive revenue at the e-commerce companies, to provide increased clarity and visibility around these good businesses by rationalizing our non consolidated assets efficiently and aiding the market’s understanding how strong the fundamentals are at QVC compared to peer company’s ability to carry both unmatched adjured OIBIDA margins, have very low capital intensity and high return on net assets and to generate very strong cash flow conversion from its OIBIDA. At Liberty Starz, we want to focus on operational execution and building cost effective original programming to differentiate our channels for the benefit of our distribution partners and our consumers. You’ll see us build excitement for the channel like this summer’s Pillars of the Earth. And finally, we want to figure out an effective way to use our capital, both the cash we have on hand and the borrowing capacity that is at that business. At Liberty Capital, we hope to identify effective uses for the large cash that we have, whether it be shrinking equities you saw us do this quarter, reducing debt as we have done or opportunistic investments in debt and equity of others. We are going to benefit from the continued growth at Sirius XM and Live Nation and we will also continue to rationalize the non-core holdings that we have at Liberty Capital. We appreciate you continued interest in and support for Liberty Media. Stay tuned over the balance of the year, and with that, we’d be happy to answer some questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital Greg, one of the rationales for the tracking stock structure was to both give the market clarity about the various assets and at the same time, retain the flexibility to mix and match tax assets with gains in the background since everything remains within the Liberty Media Corporate structure. Where are we in terms of those assets and the continuing need to have matching across various tracers for tax assets? Gregory Maffei A you’ve noted, that has been one of the benefits, has been improved tax posture. We have as you noted, continued to reduce the number of non-core assets to realize on some of our investments, hopefully in an efficient manner. That process continues. We are part of the way through there.  We’ve done substantially by dollar value, much of the work, but there are still non-core assets in the trackers, in all three trackers candidly that we are going to realize on and we expect to realize on over the next several years and to refocus our capital on our efforts on our core holdings. By dollar value, we’re a long way down the road, but there are still several assets in there to be worked on. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital For Spartacus, do you have any feedback on the level of viewership you say via Netflix streaming and how do you think about that, quite apart from the Starz play or Starz original content the degree to which Netflix is a marketing platform for the Starz network and the Starz channels versus cannibalizing potential subscribers for those channels. Chris Albrecht I don’t have right Netflix viewing on Spartacus. I don’t know if Bill Myers, who’s in the room in Denver has any available. With regard to your question, Netflix is an interesting opportunity and challenge for Starz.  Obviously, it’s very important for us to manage those relationships across the board with new distributors like Netflix along with our traditional historical distributors. It certainly is a marketing opportunity and we’re looking at ways to be able to maximize the ability to increase the awareness and hopefully the subscribership of the Starz products while still being able to enhance our value to all of the distributors. So it’s an interesting and complicated relationship and one that we continue to explore how we can maximize the opportunities that it presents. Operator You're next question comes from Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets On the interactive on QVC, I know you’re normally reluctant to go too far into talking about the current trends, but given that, we just had a whole slate of retail comp reports yesterday, and they’re generally regarding as a bit disappointing. I was wondering if you might break with tradition and give us a little bit of a sense of what you’ve seen in April and how we should think about the retail trends at Interactive. Michael George We don’t obviously talk about in quarter results. Personally, my view is, people got a little over excited about the March numbers at retail and maybe a little overly concerned about the April numbers. It was to me, somewhat predictable between the Easter pull in which people understood, but also just the acceleration of sales you get in traditional brick and mortar when you have an early onslaught of warm weather, which tends to bring people into the stores for immediate gratification of getting their warm weather gear. We’ve maintained all along that we expect the economic recovery to be slow and bumpy and that we’re going to win by gaining share and benefiting from the secular move to our kind of format, and that’s still our view. Our view is that the recovery is going to be slow and up and down and we’ll win through share gain. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets If we could switch to Starz, can you provide us any update on where you are with talks with Comcast and Time Warner and also tell us a little bit about how you’re thinking you might handle some of the questions around season two for Spartacus. Chris Albrecht We are in continued discussions with Comcast and Time Warner and as we’re in constant contact with all our distributors, not just with regard to our contract but with regard to in contract marketing opportunities. We are actually doing good business with both those major distributors and we expect to continue to do so. With regard to Spartacus, we’ve got unofficial hopeful news about Andy’s recovery, and we’re making plans right now to be able to continue with the franchise in innovative ways to keep the fans happy while we get him into shape to participate in a full second season. So we think we have the situation relatively in hand given the obviously unexpected news of his health situation. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets This e-commerce hub transition, can you size that either online or offline what that meant in terms of impact on QVC versus e-commerce? Gregory Maffei The commerce hub business is a small business, not material, but it’s one that we believe has great prospects and so we want to have it benefit from the internet DNA and broaden the great parenting from QVC. We want to broaden it out. We think the opportunity to do so will align it more with the e-commerce companies. It makes more sense. But its results are not material today. Mike George In the ballpark, roughly $20 million of revenue and eight to ten of EBITDA. Operator You're next question comes from Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Could you offer any comment on whether investors should expect a pretty serious impact to EBITDA at Starz this year or next year as a result of ramping TV programming. I know you mentioned Pillars and Camelot, but you’re also working on Men of the Dusk and William the Conqueror and World Without End. Chris, you’ve been pretty busy and you hinted at cost efficiency, but could you give us a clear understanding of the bottom line impact from ramping TV. Gregory Maffei We have said, when we made our announcement, when we put the Liberty Starz tracker in place at the closing of the Direct TV deal, and we made our announcement about expected growth in the 5% to 10% range, and we have no reason, despite the economy and despite challenges out there and things like unexpected write downs, we’re still holding to that forecast today to that range. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Have you been seeing any impact in Europe the past few weeks from what’s been happening over there and do you see the potential for any major shift in European spending? Mike George Again, I can’t comment on our own results. It doesn’t appear to me to have had a meaningful impact on the consumer yet, but I can’t say that I’m a student of all the things that are happening at retail. So it’s certainly an area we’ve got to watch out for everyone to see it how it unfolds and the impact it could have on consumer confidence, but I can’t say a lot more beyond that at this point. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank John, I was hoping given your expertise, you would give us your view on the likelihood of the SEC being successful reclassifying ISP services you’re entitled to and if they are, what you believe the impact will be broadly on the telecom sectors. John I really don’t have a lot of insight on whether the SEC will succeed in imposing their authority. Clearly the guidelines they’ve given for the future of set top boxes is heavily influence by Silicon Valley and the internet group, I would say. How that will come out politically, you can take odds on. Obviously the unbundling, if that’s the direction it takes of terrestrial broadband could be beneficial to companies like Direct TV and EchoStar by giving them the opportunity to bundle with cable broadband. But that would really take – I’m not enough of a profit to figure out where this is all going. It’s too speculative I think for anybody to bet on at this point. Operator You're next question comes from Doug Anmuth – Barclays Capital. Doug Anmuth – Barclays Capital Can you talk about the softness in the U.K. and Germany that you saw in 1Q in particular just providing a little bit more color there especially around the jewelry dynamic in Germany. It sounds like you don’t really think that was really macro impacted, but what else was playing into that? Mike George Candidly, I think the softness in both Germany and U.K. was to some degree self-inflicted. The good news is that I think we can get on it and get better results. In Germany, it was somewhat isolated to our jewelry business. We had pretty strong performance across most categories so I think fundamentally the German business is reasonably healthy. We’ve been working to fine tune that business for a couple of years now as you know, so I’m always cautious when I talk about it because you need to see several quarters of sustained results to have high confidence, but generally we’re on a good path in Germany, but we have concluded that we need to fundamentally change our jewelry business so we sort of decided to give us a high short term pain for hopefully good long term gain and we took the business totally off the air for a few weeks, and there’s no way you can fill all that air time at the same level of productivity. So we had especially tough business in March when we took jewelry off the air that suppressed the overall quarter’s results. Since we launched that business, and its early days in the re-launch, but it’s looking better. I wouldn’t say it’s perfect, but certainly we’re pleased with the early results, some gains, some misses, but generally pleased with the jewelry re-launch. But again, very early days to say much about it. So for us, in Germany it’s about getting jewelry on a reasonable track. We don’t need a lot of growth out of it, but we need to stabilize it and that’s what the re-launch was about, and then just continuing to focus on our other businesses that are successful and continue to build them. U.K. was a little bit different. It wasn’t as focused in a single category, but I would say that fine jewelry in the U.K. and consumer electronics were both very difficult. The U.K. is really the only market where our electronics business is challenged. The other markets are fairly healthy, but it’s a very competitive price driven market in the U.K. so we haven’t found exactly the right formula, although we think we will. But we’re not quite there yet. So in the U.K. we need to see a little bit performance out of fine jewelry and electronics and then just get the whole business moving at a better rate. As I mentioned in my comments, the good news last year is that we worked really hard on getting our inventory very tight in the U.K. I think we were down over 30% in our inventory levels at year-end. So we tightened things down and candidly, maybe we over tightened them, but I think we were left a little bit light in product in Q1. Once you realize that, it takes a few months to respond to it. So we started to see that issue early in January, but it does take a few months to meaningfully impact levels. But in hindsight, I think we over steered a little bit in our caution to make sure we kept our inventories clean around the world given the economic uncertainty. So some different challenges in each business. I think we’ll get them on track.  I don’t think we’ll get a boost from the economy in either market, but I think we can right the issues we saw in Q1 and get to a better level of performance. Doug Anmuth – Barclays Capital On the e-commerce business, the loss of the third party revenue, do you foresee any way of potentially making that revenue up with another advertising source or lead referral or are you pretty much focused on the user experience and we’ll let that go at this point. Gregory Maffei I think that we will over time find ways to utilize the value of those third party services to our customers and realize on some of that, but we have been very sensitive about creating undue coercion or even negative reputational risk around that. As you may know, there were Senate hearings last month on these kind of services. We were certainly not in the group identified as violators, but we were worried about being tarred by the same brush, and we were worried about reputational risk even though we went out of our way to do things like offer full refunds to anybody who complained or had an issue. It wasn’t about the customer experience, it was about the reputational risk that caused us to back off this. It was something that had become a major source not necessarily high quality revenue, because it had an upfront aspect versus a subscription that you’re likely to correct. So we collected our money on it and we tried very hard to make sure it didn’t hurt our customers in any way, shape or form. But the reputational risk around it has caused us to pull back and be very cautious. Will we be able to replace elements of it? I think we’ll find as I started out saying, we’ll find to monetize the value of our customer base, but we’re going to be very cautious in light of how some others have been viewed. Operator You're next question comes from Jason Bazinet – Citygroup. Jason Bazinet – Citygroup Just building of James’ question earlier, can you give us a few concrete examples of what would prevent you from moving to hard spends on the various trackers? On the re-upping of the Disney agreement and Starz, I wasn’t quite clear from the press release that came out what happened with the Digital rights. Can you elaborate on any of that? Gregory Maffei I’ll start by saying, if you look at our annual report that just went out, we outlined this. We know that our tracking stock structure is probably not one that gives us the highest current value for our equity. We think that is a somewhat transitory condition. It’s not likely that you’ll have 100 years of being in the tracking stock structure. But it has benefits particularly for a company, which like ourselves, has tax complexities and quite a lot of moving parts that need to be rationalized and focused. Is there anything that would prevent us from doing a hard spend on those? I suspect we have enough ATV’s, that if we set out as an absolute goal of getting a hard spend done in a hurry, we could probably do it in some reasonable time frame. I’m not sure that would be optimizing what we believe the long term value of the corporation is, which is to focus those businesses over time in the best way and to the degree that there’s an interim discount to take advantage of that by purchasing stock, virtually all of our businesses are either cash positive or cash generators or under levered or some combination of the three, that we can take advantage of that discount and realize on it. So some of our shareholders, and we recognize different constituencies may wish to see realization in a quarter or two, that may or may not happen. We’re trying to look for long-term growth and capitalize on that benefit. It’s not that there’s anything wrong with trying to do it in a hurry, it’s that we think we don’t want do that to the cost of long term benefit. On the Disney deal, I would say in the main, rights are largely the same as the rights we’ve had before. Chris Albrecht We have digital rights during our window, so I think that’s consistent with what we’ve had historically. Operator You're next question comes from David Gober – Morgan Stanley. David Gober – Morgan Stanley Just elaborating on the last comment about trying to take advantage of mis pricings or discounts and in the near term, I was just curious on LINTA, looking at the capital structure for QVC and overall the LINTA tracking stock, you pushed out maturities quite a bit. The business seems to have stabilized considerably. I’m just curious if you would reconsider starting to buy back stock again. I know you felt that you’ve been more successful with the Alcapa buy backs, but there was a time when you were clearly pretty aggressive on LINTA as well. Gregory Maffei I think that’s probably part of why we are cautious because there was a time when we were arguable too aggressive. With our tender, I think $647 million and 24/75 or something like that, we’re still scarred in Englewood, Colorado perhaps. But I also think if you look, we have done a bunch of things to stabilize the capital structure and put ourselves in a position to consider things like debt reduction which we’ve done and share repurchase. One of the things that we obviously went out of our way to do is to try and address the negative arbitrage on that debt that we have outstanding the $400 million that we are tendering for out of the $800 million maturity in 2013. I would say once that’s done, as that’s done, even if it’s not done, this capital structure is very solid and the opportunity to do either more share repurchase, more just debt pay down or acquisitions of attractive synergistic, well priced assets, remains, and certainly we have a big authorization and we’ll look hard at perhaps not a tender, but at a systematic share reduction. David Gober – Morgan Stanley Just looking at the funnel of business at QVC, the one business that we didn’t talk a ton about is QVC Japan which clearly that business has had its fits and starts over the last three or four years, but it seems to be performing extraordinarily well in the first quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about what’s driving the strength in 1Q and whether or not you really see that as fundamentally sustainable particularly given the lumpiness that business has had. Mike George Let me answer in two ways. Over a long period of time, we continue to believe that Japan has the highest growth potential of all our businesses. It’s fundamentally a very attractive market for what we do, and given that we are in less than half of all the households in terms of subscribers that can receive our signal, there’s a lot of business to grow into. You can also look at our spend as a percent of GDP and see that clearly it has enormous upside on that metric as well. The fits and starts that we’ve had over the last few years to a large extent have been fairly isolated and focused on some substantial changes in the regulatory environment that have impacted us substantially in 2007 and then some secondary issues that impacted us over time. That, and obviously the depth of the economic recession in Japan, which was the most severe of all markets we operate into. So we’ve had these two really strong headwinds, though we’ve always believed in the fundamental potential of this business in the long trajectory of this business. So I think in Q1 the team has done a fabulous job. I think the economic situation is not great, but they’ve been able to power through that. They have some businesses that are really working well for them that I mentioned in my comments. I think they’ve largely gotten past the regulatory challenges and have found a way to fill in around those issues. So I think the long-term future is bright. Do I think every quarter will be at this level? Not necessarily. I think this was a particularly strong quarter, but I do like our prospects for long-term growth in Japan. David Gober – Morgan Stanley On Starz, we kind of talked about a couple of different issues in separate contexts, and I was wondering if you could clarify a little bit how inter-related they really are. I think you have the Netflix deal and the relationship with your other distributors. I’m just wondering how upset do you think other distributors are with the Netflix relationship and is that something that’s going to play significantly into whether or not Starz decides to re-up on the Netflix deal when that comes up whenever it’s set to expire. Chris Albrecht I think that the Netflix situation is one that is a great opportunity for Starz, and as I said before, it’s one that needs to be managed within the context of our relationships of the distributors, and there’s lots of different ways that we can do that. I fully expect that we’ll be able to continue with a Netflix relationship and continue to maintain successful and growing relationships with our traditional distribution partners. This is an opportunity and every opportunity needs to be carefully examined, but we feel like we know a lot more about how to understand the needs and the differences in the distribution opportunities, and I think we’ll be in good shape moving forward. Operator You're next question comes from Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities What’s happening on the Skunk Works basis. You’ve seen what happened in the U.S. with [inaudible] shop by remote, are you increasingly looking at some of the interactive opportunities for Q within that regard? And Chris, when you look at your assets, is Anchor Bay potentially a little bit more strategic over time even if you don’t go to a full-blown HBO incarnation on original programming, there’s clearly some upside there. I know you like to keep things integrated, and I’m sure you’ll take an incremental approach to that, but if you really do get a hot hand on the programming side, what would be the bogey for a percentage of revenues and percentage of cash flow that you might get on the ancillary side, on video and all that over at Starz. It seems like that would be a somewhat material business if you’re able to replicate some of the successes you’ve had in the past. Chris Albrecht I think you can look at them as two separate issues. Certainly the DVD revenue has been historically important ancillary stream on original programming coming off of premium and the kinds of programs that we’re looking to do on Starz will be ones we hope will maximize ancillary revenue, our series, mini-series, the kinds of things we spoke about. So to the extent that we can take advantage of controlling those rights, and seeing the benefit of those revenue streams, we’ll certainly look at that as an investment opportunity. With regard to Anchor Bay with system Starz media, we’re looking at all the possible opportunities for growing that business and seeing what the proper resolution for the Starz media asset. So while Anchor Bay sits there, we’ll look at that separately from what it may or may not do to Starz entertainment and look at the opportunities for retaining rights and exploiting those off of our original programming as an issue unto itself. Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities Without divulging too much to HBO, can you give any approximation for the how the curve could move on the percentage of ancillary revenues on the overall top line over a period of time if you get to some trigger points where you gain some traction as you’ve gotten with Spartacus on the original programming side? Chris Albrecht That would be really speculating especially as we haven’t even really released the first season of Spartacus on DVD so I really couldn’t speculate on that right now. Operator You're next question comes from Jeffrey Wlodarczak – Pivotal Research. Jeffrey Wlodarczak – Pivotal Research The turning results at Starz in the first quarter, how much of that can you attribute to seasonality and then looking forward, how sustainable do you think those gains are? Chris Albrecht As I said in the comments, I think we’re seeing the economic turn down abating a bit and hopefully that will continue so that should have a positive impact, and we’re looking forward to that. I think certainly the increase in original programming that we’re planning will continue to give us marketing opportunities with our distributors and we expect to see positive results from that. I think there is opportunity for Starz given the new strategies and obviously given the economic climate. So we’re feeling pretty good about growth opportunities and our ability to invest sensibly in order to achieve them. Jeffrey Wlodarczak – Pivotal Research John, I wanted to get your take on how the situation in Europe will resolve itself, at least from your point of view. Obviously it’s important given Liberty’s exposure to Europe and I just wanted to get your take on it. Gregory Maffei John is not available for that comment. Jeffrey Wlodarczak – Pivotal Research It’s hurting Liberty Global so it would help to get his take on it. Is there any update on true position and the revenue recognition issue? Is there any way you can give us some visibility on how much EBITDA that business in generating annually and realistically is that more? Gregory Maffei I think courtesy of some changes in the accounting regulations the POTB treatment, probably led by our friends at Apple, that’s going to look a lot better for us in the near term. How we take that revenue in, is it a restatement, is it a realization on one time, how that exactly plays out, we’ll know over the coming quarters, and the magnitude of that EBITDA business, it’s less than $50 million of EBITDA kind of business but it’s recorded on a more traditional GAAP like basis with shipment equaling Reg. Where we go with that business, I don’t think it’s not necessarily a core business but a long term for liberty given what our portfolio looks like. It’s a business that’s performed well, performing very well now, and it’s a business that has lots of interesting opportunities, perhaps better served in the hands of another partner. Of course Liberty has another attribute. It’s another ATV. But we weigh all those things and we’ll see how it goes. Operator That concludes the question and answer session today. Mr. Maffei.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital Greg, one of the rationales for the tracking stock structure was to both give the market clarity about the various assets and at the same time, retain the flexibility to mix and match tax assets with gains in the background since everything remains within the Liberty Media Corporate structure. Where are we in terms of those assets and the continuing need to have matching across various tracers for tax assets? Gregory Maffei A you’ve noted, that has been one of the benefits, has been improved tax posture. We have as you noted, continued to reduce the number of non-core assets to realize on some of our investments, hopefully in an efficient manner. That process continues. We are part of the way through there.  We’ve done substantially by dollar value, much of the work, but there are still non-core assets in the trackers, in all three trackers candidly that we are going to realize on and we expect to realize on over the next several years and to refocus our capital on our efforts on our core holdings. By dollar value, we’re a long way down the road, but there are still several assets in there to be worked on. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital For Spartacus, do you have any feedback on the level of viewership you say via Netflix streaming and how do you think about that, quite apart from the Starz play or Starz original content the degree to which Netflix is a marketing platform for the Starz network and the Starz channels versus cannibalizing potential subscribers for those channels. Chris Albrecht I don’t have right Netflix viewing on Spartacus. I don’t know if Bill Myers, who’s in the room in Denver has any available. With regard to your question, Netflix is an interesting opportunity and challenge for Starz.  Obviously, it’s very important for us to manage those relationships across the board with new distributors like Netflix along with our traditional historical distributors. It certainly is a marketing opportunity and we’re looking at ways to be able to maximize the ability to increase the awareness and hopefully the subscribership of the Starz products while still being able to enhance our value to all of the distributors. So it’s an interesting and complicated relationship and one that we continue to explore how we can maximize the opportunities that it presents. Operator You're next question comes from Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets On the interactive on QVC, I know you’re normally reluctant to go too far into talking about the current trends, but given that, we just had a whole slate of retail comp reports yesterday, and they’re generally regarding as a bit disappointing. I was wondering if you might break with tradition and give us a little bit of a sense of what you’ve seen in April and how we should think about the retail trends at Interactive. Michael George We don’t obviously talk about in quarter results. Personally, my view is, people got a little over excited about the March numbers at retail and maybe a little overly concerned about the April numbers. It was to me, somewhat predictable between the Easter pull in which people understood, but also just the acceleration of sales you get in traditional brick and mortar when you have an early onslaught of warm weather, which tends to bring people into the stores for immediate gratification of getting their warm weather gear. We’ve maintained all along that we expect the economic recovery to be slow and bumpy and that we’re going to win by gaining share and benefiting from the secular move to our kind of format, and that’s still our view. Our view is that the recovery is going to be slow and up and down and we’ll win through share gain. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets If we could switch to Starz, can you provide us any update on where you are with talks with Comcast and Time Warner and also tell us a little bit about how you’re thinking you might handle some of the questions around season two for Spartacus. Chris Albrecht We are in continued discussions with Comcast and Time Warner and as we’re in constant contact with all our distributors, not just with regard to our contract but with regard to in contract marketing opportunities. We are actually doing good business with both those major distributors and we expect to continue to do so. With regard to Spartacus, we’ve got unofficial hopeful news about Andy’s recovery, and we’re making plans right now to be able to continue with the franchise in innovative ways to keep the fans happy while we get him into shape to participate in a full second season. So we think we have the situation relatively in hand given the obviously unexpected news of his health situation. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets This e-commerce hub transition, can you size that either online or offline what that meant in terms of impact on QVC versus e-commerce? Gregory Maffei The commerce hub business is a small business, not material, but it’s one that we believe has great prospects and so we want to have it benefit from the internet DNA and broaden the great parenting from QVC. We want to broaden it out. We think the opportunity to do so will align it more with the e-commerce companies. It makes more sense. But its results are not material today. Mike George In the ballpark, roughly $20 million of revenue and eight to ten of EBITDA. Operator You're next question comes from Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Could you offer any comment on whether investors should expect a pretty serious impact to EBITDA at Starz this year or next year as a result of ramping TV programming. I know you mentioned Pillars and Camelot, but you’re also working on Men of the Dusk and William the Conqueror and World Without End. Chris, you’ve been pretty busy and you hinted at cost efficiency, but could you give us a clear understanding of the bottom line impact from ramping TV. Gregory Maffei We have said, when we made our announcement, when we put the Liberty Starz tracker in place at the closing of the Direct TV deal, and we made our announcement about expected growth in the 5% to 10% range, and we have no reason, despite the economy and despite challenges out there and things like unexpected write downs, we’re still holding to that forecast today to that range. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Have you been seeing any impact in Europe the past few weeks from what’s been happening over there and do you see the potential for any major shift in European spending? Mike George Again, I can’t comment on our own results. It doesn’t appear to me to have had a meaningful impact on the consumer yet, but I can’t say that I’m a student of all the things that are happening at retail. So it’s certainly an area we’ve got to watch out for everyone to see it how it unfolds and the impact it could have on consumer confidence, but I can’t say a lot more beyond that at this point. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank John, I was hoping given your expertise, you would give us your view on the likelihood of the SEC being successful reclassifying ISP services you’re entitled to and if they are, what you believe the impact will be broadly on the telecom sectors. John I really don’t have a lot of insight on whether the SEC will succeed in imposing their authority. Clearly the guidelines they’ve given for the future of set top boxes is heavily influence by Silicon Valley and the internet group, I would say. How that will come out politically, you can take odds on. Obviously the unbundling, if that’s the direction it takes of terrestrial broadband could be beneficial to companies like Direct TV and EchoStar by giving them the opportunity to bundle with cable broadband. But that would really take – I’m not enough of a profit to figure out where this is all going. It’s too speculative I think for anybody to bet on at this point. Operator You're next question comes from Doug Anmuth – Barclays Capital. Doug Anmuth – Barclays Capital Can you talk about the softness in the U.K. and Germany that you saw in 1Q in particular just providing a little bit more color there especially around the jewelry dynamic in Germany. It sounds like you don’t really think that was really macro impacted, but what else was playing into that? Mike George Candidly, I think the softness in both Germany and U.K. was to some degree self-inflicted. The good news is that I think we can get on it and get better results. In Germany, it was somewhat isolated to our jewelry business. We had pretty strong performance across most categories so I think fundamentally the German business is reasonably healthy. We’ve been working to fine tune that business for a couple of years now as you know, so I’m always cautious when I talk about it because you need to see several quarters of sustained results to have high confidence, but generally we’re on a good path in Germany, but we have concluded that we need to fundamentally change our jewelry business so we sort of decided to give us a high short term pain for hopefully good long term gain and we took the business totally off the air for a few weeks, and there’s no way you can fill all that air time at the same level of productivity. So we had especially tough business in March when we took jewelry off the air that suppressed the overall quarter’s results. Since we launched that business, and its early days in the re-launch, but it’s looking better. I wouldn’t say it’s perfect, but certainly we’re pleased with the early results, some gains, some misses, but generally pleased with the jewelry re-launch. But again, very early days to say much about it. So for us, in Germany it’s about getting jewelry on a reasonable track. We don’t need a lot of growth out of it, but we need to stabilize it and that’s what the re-launch was about, and then just continuing to focus on our other businesses that are successful and continue to build them. U.K. was a little bit different. It wasn’t as focused in a single category, but I would say that fine jewelry in the U.K. and consumer electronics were both very difficult. The U.K. is really the only market where our electronics business is challenged. The other markets are fairly healthy, but it’s a very competitive price driven market in the U.K. so we haven’t found exactly the right formula, although we think we will. But we’re not quite there yet. So in the U.K. we need to see a little bit performance out of fine jewelry and electronics and then just get the whole business moving at a better rate. As I mentioned in my comments, the good news last year is that we worked really hard on getting our inventory very tight in the U.K. I think we were down over 30% in our inventory levels at year-end. So we tightened things down and candidly, maybe we over tightened them, but I think we were left a little bit light in product in Q1. Once you realize that, it takes a few months to respond to it. So we started to see that issue early in January, but it does take a few months to meaningfully impact levels. But in hindsight, I think we over steered a little bit in our caution to make sure we kept our inventories clean around the world given the economic uncertainty.

David Gober – Morgan Stanley On Starz, we kind of talked about a couple of different issues in separate contexts, and I was wondering if you could clarify a little bit how inter-related they really are. I think you have the Netflix deal and the relationship with your other distributors. I’m just wondering how upset do you think other distributors are with the Netflix relationship and is that something that’s going to play significantly into whether or not Starz decides to re-up on the Netflix deal when that comes up whenever it’s set to expire. Chris Albrecht I think that the Netflix situation is one that is a great opportunity for Starz, and as I said before, it’s one that needs to be managed within the context of our relationships of the distributors, and there’s lots of different ways that we can do that. I fully expect that we’ll be able to continue with a Netflix relationship and continue to maintain successful and growing relationships with our traditional distribution partners. This is an opportunity and every opportunity needs to be carefully examined, but we feel like we know a lot more about how to understand the needs and the differences in the distribution opportunities, and I think we’ll be in good shape moving forward. Operator You're next question comes from Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities What’s happening on the Skunk Works basis. You’ve seen what happened in the U.S. with [inaudible] shop by remote, are you increasingly looking at some of the interactive opportunities for Q within that regard? And Chris, when you look at your assets, is Anchor Bay potentially a little bit more strategic over time even if you don’t go to a full-blown HBO incarnation on original programming, there’s clearly some upside there. I know you like to keep things integrated, and I’m sure you’ll take an incremental approach to that, but if you really do get a hot hand on the programming side, what would be the bogey for a percentage of revenues and percentage of cash flow that you might get on the ancillary side, on video and all that over at Starz. It seems like that would be a somewhat material business if you’re able to replicate some of the successes you’ve had in the past. Chris Albrecht I think you can look at them as two separate issues. Certainly the DVD revenue has been historically important ancillary stream on original programming coming off of premium and the kinds of programs that we’re looking to do on Starz will be ones we hope will maximize ancillary revenue, our series, mini-series, the kinds of things we spoke about. So to the extent that we can take advantage of controlling those rights, and seeing the benefit of those revenue streams, we’ll certainly look at that as an investment opportunity. With regard to Anchor Bay with system Starz media, we’re looking at all the possible opportunities for growing that business and seeing what the proper resolution for the Starz media asset. So while Anchor Bay sits there, we’ll look at that separately from what it may or may not do to Starz entertainment and look at the opportunities for retaining rights and exploiting those off of our original programming as an issue unto itself. Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities Without divulging too much to HBO, can you give any approximation for the how the curve could move on the percentage of ancillary revenues on the overall top line over a period of time if you get to some trigger points where you gain some traction as you’ve gotten with Spartacus on the original programming side? Chris Albrecht That would be really speculating especially as we haven’t even really released the first season of Spartacus on DVD so I really couldn’t speculate on that right now. Operator You're next question comes from Jeffrey Wlodarczak – Pivotal Research. Jeffrey Wlodarczak – Pivotal Research The turning results at Starz in the first quarter, how much of that can you attribute to seasonality and then looking forward, how sustainable do you think those gains are? Chris Albrecht As I said in the comments, I think we’re seeing the economic turn down abating a bit and hopefully that will continue so that should have a positive impact, and we’re looking forward to that. I think certainly the increase in original programming that we’re planning will continue to give us marketing opportunities with our distributors and we expect to see positive results from that. I think there is opportunity for Starz given the new strategies and obviously given the economic climate. So we’re feeling pretty good about growth opportunities and our ability to invest sensibly in order to achieve them. Jeffrey Wlodarczak – Pivotal Research John, I wanted to get your take on how the situation in Europe will resolve itself, at least from your point of view. Obviously it’s important given Liberty’s exposure to Europe and I just wanted to get your take on it. Gregory Maffei John is not available for that comment. Jeffrey Wlodarczak – Pivotal Research It’s hurting Liberty Global so it would help to get his take on it. Is there any update on true position and the revenue recognition issue? Is there any way you can give us some visibility on how much EBITDA that business in generating annually and realistically is that more? Gregory Maffei I think courtesy of some changes in the accounting regulations the POTB treatment, probably led by our friends at Apple, that’s going to look a lot better for us in the near term. How we take that revenue in, is it a restatement, is it a realization on one time, how that exactly plays out, we’ll know over the coming quarters, and the magnitude of that EBITDA business, it’s less than $50 million of EBITDA kind of business but it’s recorded on a more traditional GAAP like basis with shipment equaling Reg. Where we go with that business, I don’t think it’s not necessarily a core business but a long term for liberty given what our portfolio looks like. It’s a business that’s performed well, performing very well now, and it’s a business that has lots of interesting opportunities, perhaps better served in the hands of another partner. Of course Liberty has another attribute. It’s another ATV. But we weigh all those things and we’ll see how it goes. Operator That concludes the question and answer session today. Mr. Maffei. Gregory Maffei Thank you very much for you interest in Liberty Media and we’ll look forward to speaking with you next quarter.

And at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer Mr. Greg Maffei. Please go ahead sir.  Gregory Maffei Thank you. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for your continued interest in Liberty Media.  Today on the call we have with me our Controller, Chris Shean, QVC CEO Mike George, Starz CEO Chris Albrecht, and other executives are available.  I’m going to start on Slide 3 highlighting our second quarter events that we thought were noteworthy.  It was a very solid quarter driven by strong operating performance across our operating businesses and good work by our management teams.  At Liberty Interactive, QVC again displayed strength in its operations. The U.S. OBIDA margin was 25.4%, the second highest in the company’s history. We continued Internet growth at the business.  QVC.com revenue grew 21% year over year and makes up now 32% of U.S. Sales. We also experienced good international results despite the strength of the U.S. dollar.  Our e-commerce companies posted 15% revenue growth, which are strong results given the choice we made to change our non-transaction revenue programs, NTR, that those choices reduced the revenue and more dramatically impacted our adjusted OBIDA.  We expect that change will continue to impact revenue, and even more dramatically OBIDA, for the balance of 2010 as we previously have discussed.  We also, at Liberty Interactive, continue to strengthen the capital structure; reducing debt and extending maturities. We retired $479 million principle amount of our 5.7% 2013 bonds through tender and open-market purchases as of July 26 th .  At Liberty Starz we had solid results despite a substantial programming write-down. We continue to see positive sequential trends in subscribers.  In July, we successfully premiered Pillars of the Earth. We’ve also announced the prequel for Spartacus and are happy to carry on with this very successful series. And we reached a comprehensive new affiliation agreement with Comcast, our largest distributor.  At Liberty Capital, Sirius XM posted strong financial results driven by good operating performance, including 583,000 net ads, improved conversion from pre-pay and churn reduction down to 1.8%.  We continued a strong buy-back program at LCAPA, and repurchased $344 million worth of shares from May 3 to July 30. We applied the proceeds from the settlement of certain of our equity collars to reduce debt by $379 million. As the end of the quarter, Liberty has no equity derivatives outstanding, and all related equity debt has been repaid. And lastly, at Liberty Cooperate, we announced the plan to split off Liberty Capital and Liberty Starz from Liberty Interactive. Post this spilt-off, Liberty Interactive will become an asset-backed stock. We continue to make progress on this spilt-off. We recently submitted our request for a private-letter ruling with the IRS.  You may note that we filed a related lawsuit on our debt last Friday. We did this to clarify certain aspects of our indenture of position. A bond holder, had alleged that the spilt-off will violate our indenture because the spilt-off assets are “substantially all” of our assets. We don’t agree. We felt, however, that it was important to get this to a swift resolution in order to remove any doubt; therefore, we filed suit.  The spilt-off will not happen until we get a successful resolution to that lawsuit. Anticipating a question that might arise from an investor, the lawsuit may affect the timing of the ultimate spilt-off, but we still are targeting a Q1 completion of the spilt-off. With that, let me turn over to Chris Shean, our Controller, to talk about LCAPA’s financial results. Christopher Shean  Thanks, Greg. Liberty Interactive Group’s revenues increased 6% to $2.1 billion in the second quarter, while adjusted OIBDA increased 4% to $428 million.  QVC, the primary driver of results amongst the Liberty Interactive attributed assets, increased total revenue by 5% to 1.8 billion, while adjusted OIBDA increased 9% to $403 million.  Liberty Interactive’s other e-commerce businesses grew revenues 15% of the quarter. Most of the e-commerce company’s posted an increase of revenue, however, overall revenue growth was partially offset by lower commission revenue earned when customers sign up for third-party online discount services. That’s the NTR that Greg was referring to.  During the first quarter, we made the decision to change the way that we handle those particular promotions, and these changes, as he mentioned, are expected to continue adversely impact revenue -- commission revenues throughout 2010. Adjusted OIBDA for the e-commerce businesses decreased 36% from second quarter and represented 9% of revenue in 2010 as compared to 70% in 2009. Revenue earned from the commissions have significantly higher margins than normal product sales and therefore the reduction in this revenue more negatively impacted adjusted OIBDA on a percentage basis.  Furthermore, increased marketing expenditures helped grow revenue in new customer names during the quarter but negatively impacted the adjusted OIBDA margin. In addition, more cost were incurred associated with our two startups; and given the stage in their operations, very little revenue at this point.  All of these negative impacts offset product-related adjusted OIBDA growth that was achieved by our e-commerce businesses.  Now, let’s take a quick look at Liberty Interactive’s liquidity. At the end of first quarter, the group had attributed cash in public investments of $3.4 billion and 7 billion in attributed debt. In the second quarter Liberty Interactive completed a successful tender of its 5.7% 2013 bonds, and through this tender and subsequent open-market purchases through July 26, $479 million principle balance of these bonds had been retired. QVC’s total debt-to-adjusted-OIBDA ratio as defined in QVC’s credit agreement was approximately 2.4 times as compared to a maximum allowable leverage of 3.75 times. QVC’s gross leverage is down significantly from its peak in 2008. Now with all that background, we’ll hand it over Mike George for additional comments specifically on QVC. Michael George  Thank you Chris. I’ll provide some additional detail on our results in each market and then conclude with some general comments about our directions.  In the U.S., we grew revenue 4% and adjusted OIBDA 10%. We were very pleased with our revenue growth in light of a more difficult economic environment, and we drove a significant increase in adjusted OIBDA yield. We saw outstanding results in our kitchen, cooking and dinning, and household categories, as well as continued strength in accessories. Consumer electronics slowed considerably, consistent with the industry-wide slow down in the CE sector. Given the slower margins however, this had a greater impact on the top line than on the bottom line.  Our U.S. e-commerce business continues to outpace overall internet retail sales with growth of 21%. QVC.com now represents 32% of the U.S. business, up 5 points from last year. That’s the second highest quarterly jump in web penetration that we’ve ever achieved. And products that have not been featured on air recently are now over half of our e-commerce business; evidence that we’re capturing incremental purchase occasions on QVC.com.  We continue to add new customers in the U.S. at a strong pace, and revenue from new customers increased 17% in the quarter; our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth from new customers. We reduced inventory levels 10% from the prior quarter, putting us in a good position to chase hot product categories in the fall and holiday season. And unlike most other retailers, we did not need to turn to heavy markdowns to bolster the sales line. Our 150 basis points increased in adjusted OIBDA yield was driven by improvements in initial product margin, reduction in freight and obsolescence, and tight expense control.  We also successfully completed the renegotiation of our agreement with GE Money Bank, the provider of our QVC proprietary credit card. The new agreement is substantially different than our previous deal.  Under the prior agreement, QVC received all the income from the card and incurred all the bad debt expense, and we paid GE a fee per active accounts for their services.  Under the new agreement, QVC and GE share the card income and bad debt expense, and GE funds the portfolio. On a pro forma basis, if this agreement had been in place over the prior three years, our adjusted OIBDA would have been approximately 20 to 25 million lower per year.  Nonetheless, the overall net economics of the new agreement will not have a material negative impact on our cash flows since we recovered our non-interest bearing cash deposit with GE of 501 million.  Now, we’re delighted that we’ve been able to renew this agreement which runs for five years, beginning August 2, at essentially neutral economics and with increased balance sheet flexibility. In this difficult credit environment, we see this as a strong endorsement of our business and our Q-card program.  Turning to international, we saw strong results in our existing markets with revenue up 8% in local currency and adjusted OIBDA of 9% excluding our Italy start-up expenses, and 5% including Italy.  U.K. turned in an outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 8% in local currency with particular strength in beauty, fashion jewelry, and some areas of home. Adjusted OIBDA grew 16% in local currency, driven principally by strong gains in warehouse and customer service operations and tight fix-cost management. Germany posted revenue growth of 7% in local currency, driven by good results in beauty, accessories, consumer electronics and small appliances. Despite the strong revenue growth, adjusted OIBDA yield fell 140 basis points in local currency, driven about equally by a reduction in initial product margins due in part to the mix shift to consumer electronics, and an increase in the obsolescence rate due to unfavorable inventory fluctuations.  However, we are very comfortable with our overall inventory levels, which are down from the prior year. The team is focused on improving the product mix for the back half to drive more balanced revenue, and profit growth.  Japan had another terrific quarter with 10% revenue growth in local currency, driven by gains across our health, beauty, fashion and home businesses. Adjusted OIBDA grew 14% in local currency, driven by a reduction in carriage commission expenses as we successfully renegotiated several contracts along with improvements in customer service and warehouse operations.  In Italy, we incurred a $5 million loss as we prepare for our October launch. We have substantially completed our headquarters’ facility, recruited a high-caliber team, received extensive positive press coverage about our increase, and secured for our launch several prominent local brands, supplemented with powerhouse global brands like Bare Escentuals, L’Occitane in beauty, in Dell, Bose, Dyson and Kitchen Aid in home. With that background by market, I’ll close with some general comments on the business. We have said all along that we expect the economic rebound to be slow and uneven. And that we will stay centered on the same core goals through the ups and downs of the recovery.  First, to create a highly differentiated destination shopping experience, one that drives loyalty for the long term, founded on compelling-exclusive products and entertaining programming, engaging multi-media platforms, and a personalized service experience, supported by state-of-the-art technology platform.  Second, to outpace the same store sales rates of our traditional brick-and-mortar competitors, and grow e-commerce revenue faster than overall Internet retail sales as we both capture a greater share of spend from existing customers and increased revenue growth from new customers.  Third, to maintain tight operating control over expenses and inventories, improve productivity, and respond quickly to what’s working in the marketplace.  We achieved each of these goals in Q2 despite the worsening economy, including improving our competitive positioning, driving strong profitability. And we achieved a few first, including passing the 2 billion revenue mark in worldwide e-commerce revenue on a rolling 12-month basis, and increasing the count of new customers to any QVC in every market we operate in for the first time in at least five years.  As we look to the back half of the year, we’ll stay focused on these priorities as we strive to gain share and drive profitable growth. We’re focused on creating fresh and exciting assortments and engaging programming for the following holidays that will create a reason to shop.  In the U.S., for example, in apparel and accessories, we’ll be launching several hot new fashion labels including K-Dash by the Kardashians and MOD by Janie Bryant, the well-known costume designer for Mad Men. And as we previously announced, we’re premiering Liz Claiborne New York, which QVC will sell exclusively.  These additions will compliment some of our newer lifestyle brands including, Isaac Mizrahi and Rachel Zoe. And in September, in a major expansion of our Fashion Week presence, we will be co-sponsoring Fashions Night Out, in partnership with Vogue Magazine, the City of New York, and the Council of Fashion Designers of America.  It’s one of the biggest global fashion events ever undertaken and QVC will play a prominent role. As part the festivities, we will be launching a pop-up score in Rockefeller Center, among other activities to build excitement about our brand.  In beauty, we’ve just launched a new partnership with Sephora to introduce and build awareness for exciting new beauty brands like Torino Tarantino. This compliments other planned or recent beauty launches, including Neutrogena Skin Care, Bliss, Spa Products, and Fresh Beauty.  In jewelry, we recently launched new lines by Hidalgo, Kat Davis, Melania Trump, and Christie Brinkley, and in the fall we’re launching our National Gem Gallery in partnership with the Smithsonian along with a new jewelry line from Pricilla Presley.  In cooking, we’ll be launching a new celebrity series featuring Gordon Ramsay, well-known for both his Hell Kitchen Series and his Master Chef Series that premiered this summer, along with Lydia [inaudible], David Berk, and Tyler Florence. These chefs will compliment strong programming with our current partners, including Rachel Ray and Paula Dean.  In consumer electronics we’re especially excited about our upcoming lines with Sony’s Move and Microsoft’s Connect Gaming Platforms. And we plan to take advantage of the explosion of the tablet category with offerings ranging from the iPad to the upcoming Dell Streak.  And we were delighted with the results of our 48-Hour Christmas in July Event, which we held a couple of weeks ago.  With a 14% sales increase over last year, we saw customer respond to new products and innovate designs in several categories, reinforcing our belief that if we focus on newness, innovation, and entertaining programming, we can drive sales and gain share this holiday season. We also continue to enhance our multi-media platforms and QVC is now available on all three screens.  In Q2, we launched a second version of our iPhone app which provides a high-def live stream of our show and easy click-to-buy ordering, along with our first Android and Blackberry apps, and we have several new apps coming up in the next few months.  On the TV side, we launched our simulcast on ITV in the U.K. at the midnight hour. And in Japan, we began a simulcast with one of the leading BS digital channels for an hour a day.  In the fall, we’ll continue to expand our TV presence; most notably in the U.K. and Germany, where we’ll be launching second channels that will feature the best-of content and expose QVC to more consumers.  With that, I’ll turn it back to Chris.  Christopher Shean  Let’s take a look at Liberty Starz. Liberty Starz attributed revenue grew 4% in the second quarter to $311 million while adjusted OIBDA decreased 1% to $103 million.  At quarter end, Liberty Starz had attributed cash and public holdings of $1.1 billion and attributed debt of 46 million.  With that summary, I’ll now have Chris Albright comment specifically on Starz Entertainment and Media. Chris Albright Thanks, Chris. Good morning. Starz Entertainment had another strong performance in the second quarter, marked by solid quarterly revenue results and a second consecutive quarter of subscriber gains on both Starz and Encore.  Also, as Greg mentioned, we entered into a new multi-year affiliation agreement with Comcast.  Revenue with Starz Entertainment of 308 million represented an increase of 4% in comparison to the same quarter from a year ago. Adjusted OIBDA grew by 2% in comparison to the second quarter of last year to 107 million.  The average number of Starz subscription units decreased by 3% in the second quarter of 2009, but increased by 200,000 units for the second quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2010.  The average number of Encore subscription decreased by 1% in the second quarter of 2009, but increased by 800,000 units for the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the first quarter of 2010. Of this increase, approximately 80% of it comes from fixed-rate deals. Despite continued levels of economic uncertainty for consumers, the value proposition of our channels and services have proved resilient in the marketplace and has driven our business performance.  At the end of the second quarter, we announced a new multi-year agreement with Comcast that consolidates our prior separate Starz and Encore affiliation contracts into one new and more comprehensive arrangement. The new agreement extends and expands our business relations with Comcast for all of Starz Entertainment channels and advanced services.  Of note, Comcast has introduced all three of our authenticated online services; Starz Online and Encore Online, and the newly launched Movieplex Online service.  We’re actively engaged in discussions with other affiliates regarding similar TV-everywhere initiatives.  Shifting over to Starz original programming, we’re pleased to note the solid performance of the Pillars of the Earth, which debuted in July. With Pillars, we achieved record levels of participation from Starz affiliates in offering three early samplings of the first two hours of the original series.  Robust sampling with our affiliates were reflects well on the awareness our originals are receiving with both affiliates and consumers, and ultimately assists in building an audience with existing and perspective Starz customers. Also, just prior to the debut of the Pillars of the Earth, we introduced a landmark iPad app with Penguin Group, publisher of the Follett novel.  The first of its kind application integrates video elements from the TV series with other multi-media tools optimized for the popular device. This business extension generated meaningful publicity and was a very cost-effective promotional tool for highlighting interest and awareness in the series. Now looking at 2011, our Starz original schedule will be the Spartacus prequel, how Spartacus got to the arena; Camelot, which is in production and for which we will retain all U.S. pay-TV rights including digital; and also the home entertainment rights; Torchwood, a new ten-episode series of the BBC hit franchise for which we announced acquiring the U.S. pay-TV rights; and the second season of Spartacus.  The half-hour comedy series Party Down and Gravity will not be returning for additional season. With respect to Party Down, we loved this show. It had critical support and we were proud to have it on our network. However, it did not find enough of an audience to justify a return for an additional season. As we have shared with you previously, Starz Entertainment is exploring several different financing models to fund our acceleration in the original space. We’ve had meaningful and constructive dialog with potential partners but please note that this process could take several more months before reaching its ultimate resolution. Now on the Starz Media front, revenue for the quarter decreased to 84 million from 90 million in the second quarter of last year, while adjusted OIBDA decreased from a positive 17 million last year to a negative 54 million during the second quarter of 2010.  Significant portion of the adjusted OIBDA change was due to approximately 42 million in impairments of production cost related to various titles due to lower theatrical, home video, and television revenue than had been originally anticipated.  The remaining decrease in adjusted OIBDA is due to the number and timing of films released theatrically and on home video and television by Starz Media and Overture Films, and the corresponding fluctuations of theatrical, home video, and television revenue and related expenses associated with these films. That brings us to the conclusion of the second quarter. Starz Media entered into an agreement of Relativity Media, allowing for Relativity to take over distribution and marketing operations of Overture Films. Two-thirds of Overture’s employees, transitioned over to Relativity and Overture will release its remaining three films to renew distribution services agreements with Relativity.  We also continued to evaluate strategic alternatives for the remainder of Starz Media’s businesses, and do not expect it to incur annual operating losses in the future of the same magnitude that it has experience in recent years, given our decision with respect to Overture. We’ll certainly keep you apprised as it relates to those efforts. With that, I will turn the call back over to Chris. Christopher Shean  Thanks Chris. Let’s take a quick look at Liberty Capital. During the quarter Liberty Capital revenue increased 1% to $200 million while adjusted OIBDA was a negative 59 million.  The Liberty Capital Group has attributed cash and public investment and 7.6 billion and attributed debt of 2 billion. From May 3 through July 30, 2010, Liberty repurchased 8 million shares of LCAPA common stock at an average price of $43.11 for total cash consideration of 344 million. Cumulative repurchases since the reclassification of this tracker represent 34% of the shares originally outstanding.  Now with that, I’ll turn the call back over to Greg. Gregory Maffei Thank you Chris. And thank you Mike and Chris for your updates on the respective businesses.  We feel that our businesses posted good operating results in the face of a challenging consumer economy. We don’t expect that that uncertain economic -- macroeconomic environment is likely to change in the near term, but our management teams will stay focused on the factors under their control.  At Liberty Media, we are going to continue to make progress on the spilt-off of Liberty Capital and Liberty Starz. At Liberty Interactive we’ll continue to have focus on excellent execution at QVC and e-commerce companies.  I note a couple of points; the e-commerce companies continued to gain share in their respective businesses, which may have been masked by the change in the NTR programs, but the underlying strength in the businesses was good.  And at QVC, I was pleased with the new [inaudible] growth, but the progress that we’re making at QVC Italy and the continued growth of the Internet elements of the business.  I’d also note that we will continue to reduce debt at Liberty Interactive in part because of the program that Mike George outlined regarding our new credit card facility.  At Liberty Starz, we’re also going to continue focusing on operational excellence, and building cost-effective original programming using a strategy to differentiate our channels with the benefit of our distribution partners and the end consumers.  We’ve made tremendous progress regarding the 2011 schedule as Chris Albright noted. And as I mentioned before, we’re very focused on what to do with the large cash balances at Liberty Starz. We are determined to come up with an effective use of that capital. At Liberty Capital, we have the same element; a large cash balance that we’re very focused on what is an effective use of capital there. You’ve seen it part, our continued share shrink, as we believe the shares are attractive. We also believe we’ll benefit from the continued growth of Sirius XM, and we’ll focus on rationalizing our non-core holdings.  So with that, let me thank you for your continued interest in and support for Liberty Media. We hope you’ll stay tuned for the next quarter, and we’ll open it up for questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Up first is Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets.  Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Okay, great. Thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could at first address interactive. And I noted your comment that you’re looking to launch second channels in some of the countries abroad. I’ve also noted that HSN is looking to launch a second channel here in the U.S. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about why you’re launching second channels abroad, and you know, if there might be an opportunity to do something like that here?  Gregory Maffei I’ll let Mike comment on that. But I would note that the structure of many of these other markets in terms of what distribution, what it takes to get incremental distribution, the cost and the scale, is very different, particularly in the U.K. or other markets with DTT. There are lots of more cost-effective ways potentially to achieve incremental distribution. But I’ll let Mike comment particular on the U.S. market.  Michael George Yeah. Of that state of that, the reason we chose the U.K. and Germany for the second channel is exactly as Greg mentioned; relatively low costs to get incremental distribution. These will be largely recorded -- previously recorded content, some original content, but largely leveraging content off the main channel.  U.K.’s second channel will focus primarily on beauty and Germany will be more mixed, but with a heavy focus on beauty.  You know, we think these take channels provide modest revenue potential, so I don’t want to overstate the impact. And the key is to be able to do it at a very low cost.  In the U.S., we may at some point explore second channels, but I would say it’s a little bit lower down on our priority list just because, again, the equation for us in terms of amount revenue potential relative to cost and caliber of the distribution is such that it’s not as clear cut of case as it is in the U.K. and Germany.  So we’ll watch those two markets. We’ll learn and optimize in those two markets, and at some point we may consider bringing it to the U.S., but that’s unclear at this point.  Gregory Maffei  Barton, I’d add, as Mike as noted in his comments, I mean, one of the ways that we’re trying to grow this business is to extend the franchise and the value of the QVC name across many platforms. That could include incremental channels, or it could include increased Internet penetration as you’ve seen, or experiments as we are in the U.K. with ITV broadcasting us late at night on a segment. You know, where we’re not launching a new channel, but in effect we’ve getting air time on one of the traditional main channels, broadcast channels there, and an interesting experiment.  So we’re always looking for ways to do that because as Mike noted, cost effectively.  Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Okay, great. And then if I could ask a question about the Starz Tracker. I was wondering if you could detail the one-time hit from the shutdown, you know, expenses for Party Down in Gravity. And then if you have any comments about your ability, you know, going forward to cover your investment in new originals by reduced spend on things like movies from Overture. You know, perhaps the benefit from less fewer films coming out of your big output deals with Disney and Sony. Gregory Maffei  So I’ll let Chris Shean comment first on the write down.  Christopher Shean  Yeah, the charges for Starz Entertainment for those two series that were shut down was almost $5 million, close to it, rounds to it.  Gregory Maffei  You want to go ahead, Chris, on the –  Chris Albrecht Sure. With regard to whether or not we’ll be able to fund the accelerated output of original programming, clearly our goal is to drive the value of the Starz businesses and original programming is an important way to create more valuable and differentiated brands. And not only do we need to create the programming, we need to be able to fund the marketing of those programs.  We think that we’ve come up with some interesting ways to approach how to fund those programs. As I’ve said before, we’ve talked to potential partners. Climates change with regards to the ancillary value of a lot of that program, so we’re focused on not the programs themselves, but how it can continue to drive Starz’ growth in the near term as well as the long term.  Gregory Maffei  But I’d add, Barton, to Chris’s point, you noted that longer term, many of these deals, these output deals that we have a lower cost structure and that does create opportunity for us. It’s a challenge for us on a revenue side to make sure we are growing both RPU and subscriber count, but the opportunity on the cost side that’s opened up by both lower spot prices, fewer programs, or rather films produced by the majors, and the structure of the new deals creates room to either reinvest in an original or bring incremental margin to the bottom line. And that’s our goal, Chris’s goal, the advancement team at Starz goal, to mediate between those two positive attributes.  Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Okay. That’s great. I’ll leave it there. Thank you.  Operator Next up we’ll hear from James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital.  James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital  Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking the questions. One related to Starz, and one related to sort of a Liberty overall view question. When you talk about rights and doing collaborative deals, what sort of rights of specific are you really targeting? Is it just U.S. pay TV, or are you interested in say U.S. DVD, later on streaming in the like?  And Greg, a more general one. When you look at buy backs, now you clearly were aggressive about LCAPA, not so at Liberty Starz this quarter. How much of that is a Liberty Media overall view that you think this is how much of the say Liberty Media LLC cash we’re willing to devote, and then you look at which tracker looks cheapest at the moment and how much of it really is a -- do you think of it on a cash balance by individual tracker basis? Gregory Maffei  After you, Chris.  Chris Albrecht  With regard to the rights on the Starz programming, certainly pay television rights are important, but with the way these services are packaged we need to also retain the digital steaming rights. So those are ones that are crucial to us being able to do our business. With regard to the other rights, we look at them both globally and as a case-by-case basis. As I said, the ancillary markets have changed and we’re going to try to make the best decision based on the analysis of the value of those rights with regard to the slate and each individual programming as we go forward.  Gregory Maffei James, on the second part of the question regarding cash balances, while there obviously is shared responsibility ultimately for the debt, we’re very comfortable with the equity values and that really has become a non issue.  We let each of the trackers ride on its own bottom when thinking about equity repurchase decisions. The Board affirms that’s, thinking with its head as if it were the Board representing Liberty Starz, or Liberty Capital, or Liberty Interactive. So I think we think of them each individually. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital  Thank you.  Operator Deutsche Bank’s Doug Mitchelson is up next.  Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Thanks very much. So Greg, I’m actually not going to ask you a Liberty Capital question, this quarter. So that’s something. So on Starz, a couple of questions for Chris or Greg.  I think one is, was the growth the last two quarter, quarter-over-quarter for subscribers coming from your fix-rate contracts or the contracts where you’re paid per sub? I know last year you sort of had the positive where it was the fixed rate contracts where we lost subscribers. But what’s that impact on the first two quarters? That’s the first one.  Gregory Maffei  Well, the growth came from both fixed rate deals and I’ll let Bill Myers, who’s the President over at Starz Entertainment give you specifics. He’s got the numbers in front of him, and his glasses on.  Bill Myers  Yeah, on the Starz side, this is just for the last quarter. We have been growing subs in our consignment side. So basically what we’ve done in this last quarter is since we did our Comcast deal, they’ve taken advantage of the deal and pretty much all that growth has come out of fixed-rate deals in the last quarter. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Okay, that’s clear. Thank you. And then maybe, Chris, to help us with this TV budget issue, the way to go about it is, can you give us a sense of where the TV programming budgets for Starz was in 2009 and where it’s coming out in 2010? And then we can sort of make some guesses where you might go into 2011 and beyond. You know, a percentage of programming costs, or the dollar basis.  Christopher Shean  Yeah, programming cost percentage. Well, we’re increasing -- I don’t have the numbers.  Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank It’s probably easier to do it by hours, isn’t it?  Christopher Shean Yeah, we’re ramping up to hopefully around 70 hours of programming a year. That is a significant increase over what Starz has done before.  I would say that although that increase is probably a multiple of three or four, it will represent an increase in the original programming spend, probably double the original programming spend. And depending on how we look at the marketing, that number will fluctuate.  Gregory Maffei But I can say if there’s relucence here, Doug, that’s exactly why. We have been focused on, as Chris noted, several ways to take some of these costs, share them with partners, look at innovative ways to handle that.  So we know what the target, what we want to get done on the amount of original program we believe is helpful if not critical to differentiate the channel. How exactly it will be costed out, you know, how we will pay for it and how much we’ll float to the income statement is still the question.  Chris Albrecht Yeah. And I just want to re-emphasize that we’re committed to maintaining the growth at Starz and not having the investment in original programming change the trajectory of that growth. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Got you. And then last question, this one is going to be a little bit dicey. Disney indicated that it’s protected on any renewal with Netflix and that it would participate in growth in that digital revenue stream that you might receive at Starz. Can you help us understand, is that a simple revenue share over a certain, you know, fixed point, or is that a cost per stream? There’s a lot of debate about how you might approach the contract and I know you’re not going to give us, you know, anticipate what that contract might be, but the nature of whether it’s per stream or just a simple revenue share would be helpful.  Chris Albrecht Rejected in the since that we have structured a deal that kind of maintains the premium nature of the service, and that above a certain number of Internet subscribers, they get an incremental -- they get the license fee above that. So there’s a certain number of subs that we get free and then above that they can play on a incremental-fee basis.  Gregory Maffei  Look, I know that the Nexflix deal is a relatively short-term deal, was we’ve noted. It was a tap in the marketplace, and we’ll see how that evolves.  It’s logical that our partners would participate in growth in that Internet business at some point and we structured a deal. We hope it’s a good partnership with Disney to do that. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Right. Okay. Thank you.  Operator Next we’ll take a question from Matt Harrigan, Wunderlich Securities Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, you noted that you had more new customer activity at Q. I did notice that you were a little bit more visible in the image advertising side at the World Cup and Wimbledon, and I’m curious if your thinking is evolving in terms of the efficacy of more marketing for Q to introduce it to new clients. And then my second question just relates to the deal you announced using Ensequence for EBIF and what the upside for Q is there.  And then lastly, on Liberty Starz, when you look at, you mentioned you retained the rights for home entertainment for Camelot, when you look at a fairly successful series, some of the HBO shows over the years, what would be the home entertainment potential for a mild hit, or a break-out hit? I would assume that those are real dollars. If you could just put a broad collar in quantifying that.  Gregory Maffei  Mike, maybe you can comment first on Q.  Michael George  Sure. On the marketing side, you know, I would say our view that traditional TV and print advertising does not have a strong ROI associated with it, that view still holds.  From the light of what you say, the recent advertising, I would note that all of that came at no cost to QVC and as part of our long-standing affiliate agreement for by they provide us with some airtime. So I think that says we’re doing, you know, a better job of how we get that airtime and the caliber of the advertising. But all of that is at no cost to QVC.  You know, that said, I would say that our marketing activities continue to pick up but generally what we find is most effective is things that drive heavy levels of PR, and we do a lot of event-based activities that draw celebrities, draw PR attention. And we are carefully wrapping up our online spend as we, you know, fine tune the ROI models for where we can play in Internet-based advertising.  So I think it’s fair to say you’ll see a -- I hope you’ll see a continued pickup in visibility of QVC but it will not result in a significant increase in paid marketing, which we continue to believe for the most part is not highly advantageous for us. On the Ensequence deal, I should now that Ensequence announced -- made an announcement, QVC has not made any announcement about that. But nonetheless, you know, as that announcement indicated, we are looking at launching an interactive shop-by-remote application in the U.S. We’ve had one in the U.K. for about ten years.  And as I’ve always maintained on these interactive applications, I don’t think they drive significant incremental revenue. It’s another form of convenience for the customer. What we’ve seen -- the reason we decided to go forward is that we’ve seen both the cost of deployment technology drop dramatically in the last year as well as obviously a pretty rapid expansion in the number of EBIF-enabled homes. So we just felt that the equation, not unlike the second channel discussion we had a minute ago, we thought the equation was good in that the cost to do it had fallen quite a bit and the availability had increased.  So we’re excited about it. We hope it might drive some incremental revenue. It may create some cost avoidance if it avoids a phone call to our live operators. But I think what it mainly is is a way to continue to get consumers -- to continue to make the service available when it and how consumers want it and try to be flexible in terms of providing a variety of devices and platforms from which the consumer can experience the show.  So I think all this just continues to make us more relevant in the marketplace.  Gregory Maffei  If I could add to Mike’s point, I mean, we’re seeing an enormous growth in our interactive revenue called the Internet. And it’s the general purpose Internet with people using devices that has seen the growth.  And Mike, you might comment in particular how, you know, in [inaudible], we’ve seen a relative decline in the buy button compared –  Michael George  Yeah, we have. We’ve clearly seen as the Internet has taken off and mobile has taken off that in the U.K. at least our interactive, the use of the buy button has declined over time. We continue to try to innovate on the buy button to hold those sales, but we’re not losing those sales, they’re just, you know, they’re going to the Internet, and that’s a more -- in our view, at least for now, that’s more natural, you know, with our -- we’ve seen from a very low base, extraordinary growth in the adoption of our iPhone and other Smartphone apps. And we’re now seeing real sales from those apps. And quite frankly, if you’re sitting on the couch watching TV, it’s as quick to pull out your iPhone and in about two clicks have ordered the product than it is to try to learn how to use the remote control.  So again, I don’t want to -- we hope we’ll find some exciting interactive applications through the remote. I don’t want to diminish that, or we wouldn’t be doing it. But it is part of this broad line of services and, you know, if you kind of go through our priorities, at the very top of our list would be Internet and mobile, and the interactive and second channels would be, you know, not slower, but nonetheless, something we want to experiment with. Gregory Maffei Great. Chris?  Chris Albrecht  In regard to the DVD, I mean, obviously the DVD business has been declining, but we do believe that those rates on successful series and miniseries are worth real revenue. And unlike the theatrical business, where there’s been a target ratio between box-office and DVD sales, the TV business has been a lot less of a formulated business.  And with the research that we’ve been able to get the information that we’ve been able to get shows that box sets of successful series and Internet-type miniseries are holding up better than the theatrical marketplace is. And we’re going to get some first-hand experience in that because we’re going to steam the Spartacus CD first season in September. So this is a little bit of a new frontier for us, but we do look at these rights, as I said before, as opportunistic on a case-by-case and overall slate basis. And we still think that there’s value there with the right projects.  Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities Good. Thank you very much.  Gregory Maffei  Great. Thanks.  Operator Now we’ll hear from Tom Egan with Collins Stewart.  Tom Egan – Collins Stewart Super, thank you very much. First question is on Starz Media. I guess I was hoping you could provide some color on what may drive some of the revenue in the second half of this year. Was it mostly coming from film library?  And then in terms of costs, with 2/3s of the overhead going over to relativity, what will make up the cost side of that, the second half? And then I have a followup. Thanks.  Gregory Maffei Revenue in Starz Media for the second half of the year will be driven mostly by the library and the current products that are out there on the Overture side, as well as three additional Overture titles which will be released, as I said before, through our new distribution service agreement with Relativity, which is using the former Overture team, so they’re very familiar with the films.  With respect to the expenses going forward, as I said, we’re evaluating all the strategic options for the Starz Media businesses, and we’re committed to trying to get the best result for the Starz Media shareholders as we go forward. But, you know, as I mentioned, we’re looking at significantly less losses in the Starz Media category given the decision that we made on Overture.  Tom Egan with Collins Stewart Right. And so is Starz Media getting a distribution fee on the three films that are being released via Relativity?  Gregory Maffei  No, actually we have a distribution service. The ownership structure of those remains intact. The only think that Relativity is doing is distributing those films for us so –  Tom Egan with Collins Stewart Okay.  Gregory Maffei  Right. So it’s actually the reverse of that you said.  Tom Egan with Collins Stewart Right. Okay. And the in terms of the overhead, so now Starz Media only incurs 1/3 of the overhead, or 1/3 of the personnel that were transferred. Is that right?  Gregory Maffei  Well actually, we’re continuing to resolve the staff issues for the rest of Overture’s business because now that we are not in the business of acquiring and distributing films, there’s a lot of clean up that needs to be done. But the need for that staff going forward is for a very limited time.  Tom Egan with Collins Stewart Right. Okay. And the on Starz Network, so clearly that margin was under a little bit of pressure in the first half because of higher programming and marketing costs. So what should we expect for the second half? Thanks.  Gregory Maffei  Well first, we remain comfortable with the estimates we set forth in, I believe it was November at the time we launched the tracker. Our 2010 estimate remains intact. We are still saying 5 to 10% growth, but we haven’t changed that. You can back in to where we are.  Tom Egan with Collins Stewart Yep. Okay. Great. Thank you.  Operator Our next question today comes from Douglas Anmuth with Barclays Capital.  Douglas Anmuth – Barclays Capital  Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you a couple of things around QVC. Mike, first can you provide some more detail in the drivers of the U.S. EBITDA margins and in particular, trying to figure how sustainable these are going forward excluding effects of the GE Credit deal.  And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about the trajectory of sales during 2Q and perhaps so far into the third quarter and how you’re thinking about the back half? Thanks.  Michael George Sure, Doug. On EBITDA, as I mentioned, you know, we saw some enhancement in initial product margins as the mix of the business shifted away from some of the lower-margin categories. As you know, I’m always low to try to predict product margins because it just really depends on what the consumer is engaged with. And so if we see consumer electronics really explode in the back half of the year after a bit of a lull in Q2, and we are excited about some of the innovations that are starting to get to market. This was a very innovation-bare period. You know, that would make the product margin look one way, but it would also probably help our sales line, so we’d probably be looking at s somewhat lower rate but maybe more attractive sales. And if we’re in the heavy apparel cycle, we could get the invert. So I try to shy way from being real predictive around product margins.  The other things that empowered the EBITDA were a nice gain in -- a nice reduction in the obsolescence rate. We’ll continue to manage inventories tightly. We probably saw a little bit bigger improvement in Q2 than we might see on an average basis. And then we’ve just had pretty good leverage of our fixed costs line.  So a long way of saying, I don’t know if every quarter we can see the kind of improvement in EBITDA rate that we saw in Q2. That’s an unusually high rate of improvement. But probably the biggest unknown for us is, you know, what’s the product mix look like and how do you sort of trade off sales growth versus product margin rate.  And then as you noted, we do have to kind of adjust EBITDA going forward for the impact of the GE deal.  In terms of sales trajectory, I also always hate to talk about, you know, sort of sales trends within a quarter because we’re so influenced by the programming calendar that it’s a little bit hard to get a read on it. But I think it’s fair to say in Q2, April was the toughest month, and that we’ve seen a decent improvement in the business as we went through the quarter. I don’t know that that reflects any underlying improvement in the economy. I think it probably reflects more our ability to try to get a response to what became a bit of a slowdown in those months and try to adjust our product mix accordingly.  So we were pleased with our ability to respond and to see some improving momentum as we went through the quarter. You know, I’ll shy away from commenting on end-quarter results, just given our policy on that. Although, we did disclose that our Christmas in July event at the end of July was very strong. How predictive is that of Q4 sales? Again, a little bit hard to say, but it did tell me that the consumer was a bit bored with the summer and with all the sales in traditional retail. And when we put on a lot of innovation at Christmas in July, we got a really terrific result with the 14% growth that weekend.  So you know, we’re going to continue to try to present that sort of innovation and see if we can’t power some sales in the back half.  Tom Egan with Collins Stewart Great. If I could just follow up real quickly on the GE situation. And obviously I understand the positive effects in terms of cash and everything going forward, but how should we think about this in terms of revenue? That part seems a little cloudier.  Michael George There’s no material impact, but Dan O’Connell, do you want to just comment on that?  Dan O’Connell Well, I think what we can expect going forward is hopefully as the economy recovers, a reduction of the bad debt rate, which is about 8% on that portfolio, and we did increase the APR on the card at the beginning of the year. And we’re seeing some revenue growth from that.  So I don’t think we’ll see much acceleration in the growth. The portfolio itself has grown by about 20 million from end of the year. Average account balances are up slightly and I guess in the current economic environment we’re seeing a little bit more in revolving activity on the card.  So it’s hard to predict how that will play out in the balance of the year, but I would say the portfolio is performing well right now and will continue to do so.  Gregory Maffei  And I would add also that the income from the card is not captured as a component of revenue. It’s a reduction of SG&A expense.  There shouldn’t be any impact to revenue on the top line.  Dan O’Connell  If I could add one more thing on the operating margin, if you look historically over the last couple of years, Q2 has tended to be a seasonally high operating margin. I don’t know whether that’s product mix or what, but we tend to have the highest operating margins, or among the highest operating margins in Q2. So that’s when you look sequentially that that’s a great -- really the best test.  Tom Egan with Collins Stewart Okay, that’s great. Thank you.  Operator And our final question today will come from Douglas Anmuth with Barclays Capital. I apologize. Our final question today comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi.  Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Thanks so much. How are you?  Gregory Maffei  Good.  Jason Bazinet - Citigroup I have a question for Mr. George on QVC. Earlier this year at the analyst day you were kind enough to sort of share with us the trends in the bad debt expense and the write-off rates of the Q-card as well as Easy-Pay. I think in the release that you issued this morning, you said that the bad debt expense did pick up a bit. Is the same thing true for the Q-card and the Easy-Pay write-off rates? Michael George Dan, why don’t you take that one?  Dan O’Connell  Yeah, I mentioned a minute ago that the bad debt rate on the Q-card was about 8%, that’s up from about 7.4% last year. And I believe for the year-to-date period, up about 2.4 million in write-offs on the Q-card.  Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Okay. And can I ask a conceptual question? This is going to sound negative and it’s really not meant to be.  When I sort of think about how well you guys performed in the downturn and how well you’re performing now relative to sort of the buy-side expectations. And I listened to the number of new customers that you’re getting, is it possible that you all have sort of found a new sweet spot, if you will, by being a bit more flexible in terms of credit you’re willing to extend to people, or you know, whatever other screens you use in terms of credit scores?  In other words, in an environment where other retails are being more restrictive and scared, you sort of opened up the envelope a little bit. Is that a fair characterization, or would you say that’s a misguided notion?  Michael George Well, I would say on, you know, we extend credit in two ways. One is through our Q-card and we have not fundamentally changed or loosened up the screening; and if anything on the margin, it’s probably a little tighter as we went through the recession. We were already fairly tight, so we didn’t have to respond as aggressively as other people did. And the issuance of our Q-card has been about stable or even down slightly.  So I would say that as a general statement, while people are revolving more, to Dan’s point, we’re not fundamentally increasing the usage of credit on the Q-card.  The other vehicle we use is Easy-Pay, where we will offer two to six installments on higher price-point purchases. We have used that a little bit more during the recession, and I think that’s been an effective tool for us. Although having said all of that, at the conceptual level, do I think credit access is meaningful in the story about performance? Probably not. I wouldn’t put that, in my own judgement, as one of the top drivers of getting incremental market share. I really do think at the core of the market share is driven more by the fundamentals of I think a better level of product innovation, more entertaining programming and really this focus on the Internet.  And when you look at that 21% growth in revenue from the Internet in the U.S., that’s really a huge number; meaningfully different from other people in this space. And I think that just is continuing to entice more people to both get incremental purchases from QVC customers but also entice more new customers to the platform. Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Okay. Thank you very much.  Gregory Maffei  Operator, with that let us end the questions and we’ve gone the hour. Thank you to all who are listening for your interest in Liberty again. And I will look forward to seeing you next quarter, hearing from you. Thank you.  Operator  And that does conclude today’s Liberty Media Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call.

(Operator Instructions) Up first is Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets.  Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Okay, great. Thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could at first address interactive. And I noted your comment that you’re looking to launch second channels in some of the countries abroad. I’ve also noted that HSN is looking to launch a second channel here in the U.S. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about why you’re launching second channels abroad, and you know, if there might be an opportunity to do something like that here?  Gregory Maffei I’ll let Mike comment on that. But I would note that the structure of many of these other markets in terms of what distribution, what it takes to get incremental distribution, the cost and the scale, is very different, particularly in the U.K. or other markets with DTT. There are lots of more cost-effective ways potentially to achieve incremental distribution. But I’ll let Mike comment particular on the U.S. market.  Michael George Yeah. Of that state of that, the reason we chose the U.K. and Germany for the second channel is exactly as Greg mentioned; relatively low costs to get incremental distribution. These will be largely recorded -- previously recorded content, some original content, but largely leveraging content off the main channel.  U.K.’s second channel will focus primarily on beauty and Germany will be more mixed, but with a heavy focus on beauty.  You know, we think these take channels provide modest revenue potential, so I don’t want to overstate the impact. And the key is to be able to do it at a very low cost.  In the U.S., we may at some point explore second channels, but I would say it’s a little bit lower down on our priority list just because, again, the equation for us in terms of amount revenue potential relative to cost and caliber of the distribution is such that it’s not as clear cut of case as it is in the U.K. and Germany.  So we’ll watch those two markets. We’ll learn and optimize in those two markets, and at some point we may consider bringing it to the U.S., but that’s unclear at this point.  Gregory Maffei  Barton, I’d add, as Mike as noted in his comments, I mean, one of the ways that we’re trying to grow this business is to extend the franchise and the value of the QVC name across many platforms. That could include incremental channels, or it could include increased Internet penetration as you’ve seen, or experiments as we are in the U.K. with ITV broadcasting us late at night on a segment. You know, where we’re not launching a new channel, but in effect we’ve getting air time on one of the traditional main channels, broadcast channels there, and an interesting experiment.  So we’re always looking for ways to do that because as Mike noted, cost effectively.  Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Okay, great. And then if I could ask a question about the Starz Tracker. I was wondering if you could detail the one-time hit from the shutdown, you know, expenses for Party Down in Gravity. And then if you have any comments about your ability, you know, going forward to cover your investment in new originals by reduced spend on things like movies from Overture. You know, perhaps the benefit from less fewer films coming out of your big output deals with Disney and Sony. Gregory Maffei  So I’ll let Chris Shean comment first on the write down.  Christopher Shean  Yeah, the charges for Starz Entertainment for those two series that were shut down was almost $5 million, close to it, rounds to it.  Gregory Maffei  You want to go ahead, Chris, on the –  Chris Albrecht Sure. With regard to whether or not we’ll be able to fund the accelerated output of original programming, clearly our goal is to drive the value of the Starz businesses and original programming is an important way to create more valuable and differentiated brands. And not only do we need to create the programming, we need to be able to fund the marketing of those programs.  We think that we’ve come up with some interesting ways to approach how to fund those programs. As I’ve said before, we’ve talked to potential partners. Climates change with regards to the ancillary value of a lot of that program, so we’re focused on not the programs themselves, but how it can continue to drive Starz’ growth in the near term as well as the long term.  Gregory Maffei  But I’d add, Barton, to Chris’s point, you noted that longer term, many of these deals, these output deals that we have a lower cost structure and that does create opportunity for us. It’s a challenge for us on a revenue side to make sure we are growing both RPU and subscriber count, but the opportunity on the cost side that’s opened up by both lower spot prices, fewer programs, or rather films produced by the majors, and the structure of the new deals creates room to either reinvest in an original or bring incremental margin to the bottom line. And that’s our goal, Chris’s goal, the advancement team at Starz goal, to mediate between those two positive attributes.  Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Okay. That’s great. I’ll leave it there. Thank you.  Operator Next up we’ll hear from James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital.  James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital  Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking the questions. One related to Starz, and one related to sort of a Liberty overall view question. When you talk about rights and doing collaborative deals, what sort of rights of specific are you really targeting? Is it just U.S. pay TV, or are you interested in say U.S. DVD, later on streaming in the like?  And Greg, a more general one. When you look at buy backs, now you clearly were aggressive about LCAPA, not so at Liberty Starz this quarter. How much of that is a Liberty Media overall view that you think this is how much of the say Liberty Media LLC cash we’re willing to devote, and then you look at which tracker looks cheapest at the moment and how much of it really is a -- do you think of it on a cash balance by individual tracker basis? Gregory Maffei  After you, Chris.  Chris Albrecht  With regard to the rights on the Starz programming, certainly pay television rights are important, but with the way these services are packaged we need to also retain the digital steaming rights. So those are ones that are crucial to us being able to do our business. With regard to the other rights, we look at them both globally and as a case-by-case basis. As I said, the ancillary markets have changed and we’re going to try to make the best decision based on the analysis of the value of those rights with regard to the slate and each individual programming as we go forward.  Gregory Maffei James, on the second part of the question regarding cash balances, while there obviously is shared responsibility ultimately for the debt, we’re very comfortable with the equity values and that really has become a non issue.  We let each of the trackers ride on its own bottom when thinking about equity repurchase decisions. The Board affirms that’s, thinking with its head as if it were the Board representing Liberty Starz, or Liberty Capital, or Liberty Interactive. So I think we think of them each individually. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital  Thank you.  Operator Deutsche Bank’s Doug Mitchelson is up next.  Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Thanks very much. So Greg, I’m actually not going to ask you a Liberty Capital question, this quarter. So that’s something. So on Starz, a couple of questions for Chris or Greg.  I think one is, was the growth the last two quarter, quarter-over-quarter for subscribers coming from your fix-rate contracts or the contracts where you’re paid per sub? I know last year you sort of had the positive where it was the fixed rate contracts where we lost subscribers. But what’s that impact on the first two quarters? That’s the first one.  Gregory Maffei  Well, the growth came from both fixed rate deals and I’ll let Bill Myers, who’s the President over at Starz Entertainment give you specifics. He’s got the numbers in front of him, and his glasses on.  Bill Myers  Yeah, on the Starz side, this is just for the last quarter. We have been growing subs in our consignment side. So basically what we’ve done in this last quarter is since we did our Comcast deal, they’ve taken advantage of the deal and pretty much all that growth has come out of fixed-rate deals in the last quarter. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Okay, that’s clear. Thank you. And then maybe, Chris, to help us with this TV budget issue, the way to go about it is, can you give us a sense of where the TV programming budgets for Starz was in 2009 and where it’s coming out in 2010? And then we can sort of make some guesses where you might go into 2011 and beyond. You know, a percentage of programming costs, or the dollar basis.  Christopher Shean  Yeah, programming cost percentage. Well, we’re increasing -- I don’t have the numbers.  Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank It’s probably easier to do it by hours, isn’t it?  Christopher Shean Yeah, we’re ramping up to hopefully around 70 hours of programming a year. That is a significant increase over what Starz has done before.  I would say that although that increase is probably a multiple of three or four, it will represent an increase in the original programming spend, probably double the original programming spend. And depending on how we look at the marketing, that number will fluctuate.  Gregory Maffei But I can say if there’s relucence here, Doug, that’s exactly why. We have been focused on, as Chris noted, several ways to take some of these costs, share them with partners, look at innovative ways to handle that.  So we know what the target, what we want to get done on the amount of original program we believe is helpful if not critical to differentiate the channel. How exactly it will be costed out, you know, how we will pay for it and how much we’ll float to the income statement is still the question.  Chris Albrecht Yeah. And I just want to re-emphasize that we’re committed to maintaining the growth at Starz and not having the investment in original programming change the trajectory of that growth. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Got you. And then last question, this one is going to be a little bit dicey. Disney indicated that it’s protected on any renewal with Netflix and that it would participate in growth in that digital revenue stream that you might receive at Starz. Can you help us understand, is that a simple revenue share over a certain, you know, fixed point, or is that a cost per stream? There’s a lot of debate about how you might approach the contract and I know you’re not going to give us, you know, anticipate what that contract might be, but the nature of whether it’s per stream or just a simple revenue share would be helpful.  Chris Albrecht Rejected in the since that we have structured a deal that kind of maintains the premium nature of the service, and that above a certain number of Internet subscribers, they get an incremental -- they get the license fee above that. So there’s a certain number of subs that we get free and then above that they can play on a incremental-fee basis.  Gregory Maffei  Look, I know that the Nexflix deal is a relatively short-term deal, was we’ve noted. It was a tap in the marketplace, and we’ll see how that evolves.  It’s logical that our partners would participate in growth in that Internet business at some point and we structured a deal. We hope it’s a good partnership with Disney to do that. Doug Mitchelson – Deutsche Bank Right. Okay. Thank you.  Operator Next we’ll take a question from Matt Harrigan, Wunderlich Securities Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, you noted that you had more new customer activity at Q. I did notice that you were a little bit more visible in the image advertising side at the World Cup and Wimbledon, and I’m curious if your thinking is evolving in terms of the efficacy of more marketing for Q to introduce it to new clients. And then my second question just relates to the deal you announced using Ensequence for EBIF and what the upside for Q is there.  And then lastly, on Liberty Starz, when you look at, you mentioned you retained the rights for home entertainment for Camelot, when you look at a fairly successful series, some of the HBO shows over the years, what would be the home entertainment potential for a mild hit, or a break-out hit? I would assume that those are real dollars. If you could just put a broad collar in quantifying that.  Gregory Maffei  Mike, maybe you can comment first on Q.  Michael George  Sure. On the marketing side, you know, I would say our view that traditional TV and print advertising does not have a strong ROI associated with it, that view still holds.  From the light of what you say, the recent advertising, I would note that all of that came at no cost to QVC and as part of our long-standing affiliate agreement for by they provide us with some airtime. So I think that says we’re doing, you know, a better job of how we get that airtime and the caliber of the advertising. But all of that is at no cost to QVC.  You know, that said, I would say that our marketing activities continue to pick up but generally what we find is most effective is things that drive heavy levels of PR, and we do a lot of event-based activities that draw celebrities, draw PR attention. And we are carefully wrapping up our online spend as we, you know, fine tune the ROI models for where we can play in Internet-based advertising.  So I think it’s fair to say you’ll see a -- I hope you’ll see a continued pickup in visibility of QVC but it will not result in a significant increase in paid marketing, which we continue to believe for the most part is not highly advantageous for us. On the Ensequence deal, I should now that Ensequence announced -- made an announcement, QVC has not made any announcement about that. But nonetheless, you know, as that announcement indicated, we are looking at launching an interactive shop-by-remote application in the U.S. We’ve had one in the U.K. for about ten years.  And as I’ve always maintained on these interactive applications, I don’t think they drive significant incremental revenue. It’s another form of convenience for the customer. What we’ve seen -- the reason we decided to go forward is that we’ve seen both the cost of deployment technology drop dramatically in the last year as well as obviously a pretty rapid expansion in the number of EBIF-enabled homes. So we just felt that the equation, not unlike the second channel discussion we had a minute ago, we thought the equation was good in that the cost to do it had fallen quite a bit and the availability had increased.  So we’re excited about it. We hope it might drive some incremental revenue. It may create some cost avoidance if it avoids a phone call to our live operators. But I think what it mainly is is a way to continue to get consumers -- to continue to make the service available when it and how consumers want it and try to be flexible in terms of providing a variety of devices and platforms from which the consumer can experience the show.  So I think all this just continues to make us more relevant in the marketplace.  Gregory Maffei  If I could add to Mike’s point, I mean, we’re seeing an enormous growth in our interactive revenue called the Internet. And it’s the general purpose Internet with people using devices that has seen the growth.  And Mike, you might comment in particular how, you know, in [inaudible], we’ve seen a relative decline in the buy button compared –  Michael George  Yeah, we have. We’ve clearly seen as the Internet has taken off and mobile has taken off that in the U.K. at least our interactive, the use of the buy button has declined over time. We continue to try to innovate on the buy button to hold those sales, but we’re not losing those sales, they’re just, you know, they’re going to the Internet, and that’s a more -- in our view, at least for now, that’s more natural, you know, with our -- we’ve seen from a very low base, extraordinary growth in the adoption of our iPhone and other Smartphone apps. And we’re now seeing real sales from those apps. And quite frankly, if you’re sitting on the couch watching TV, it’s as quick to pull out your iPhone and in about two clicks have ordered the product than it is to try to learn how to use the remote control.  So again, I don’t want to -- we hope we’ll find some exciting interactive applications through the remote. I don’t want to diminish that, or we wouldn’t be doing it. But it is part of this broad line of services and, you know, if you kind of go through our priorities, at the very top of our list would be Internet and mobile, and the interactive and second channels would be, you know, not slower, but nonetheless, something we want to experiment with. Gregory Maffei Great. Chris?  Chris Albrecht  In regard to the DVD, I mean, obviously the DVD business has been declining, but we do believe that those rates on successful series and miniseries are worth real revenue. And unlike the theatrical business, where there’s been a target ratio between box-office and DVD sales, the TV business has been a lot less of a formulated business.  And with the research that we’ve been able to get the information that we’ve been able to get shows that box sets of successful series and Internet-type miniseries are holding up better than the theatrical marketplace is. And we’re going to get some first-hand experience in that because we’re going to steam the Spartacus CD first season in September. So this is a little bit of a new frontier for us, but we do look at these rights, as I said before, as opportunistic on a case-by-case and overall slate basis. And we still think that there’s value there with the right projects.  Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities Good. Thank you very much.  Gregory Maffei  Great. Thanks.  Operator Now we’ll hear from Tom Egan with Collins Stewart.  Tom Egan – Collins Stewart Super, thank you very much. First question is on Starz Media. I guess I was hoping you could provide some color on what may drive some of the revenue in the second half of this year. Was it mostly coming from film library?  And then in terms of costs, with 2/3s of the overhead going over to relativity, what will make up the cost side of that, the second half? And then I have a followup. Thanks.  Gregory Maffei Revenue in Starz Media for the second half of the year will be driven mostly by the library and the current products that are out there on the Overture side, as well as three additional Overture titles which will be released, as I said before, through our new distribution service agreement with Relativity, which is using the former Overture team, so they’re very familiar with the films.  With respect to the expenses going forward, as I said, we’re evaluating all the strategic options for the Starz Media businesses, and we’re committed to trying to get the best result for the Starz Media shareholders as we go forward. But, you know, as I mentioned, we’re looking at significantly less losses in the Starz Media category given the decision that we made on Overture.  Tom Egan with Collins Stewart Right. And so is Starz Media getting a distribution fee on the three films that are being released via Relativity?  Gregory Maffei  No, actually we have a distribution service. The ownership structure of those remains intact. The only think that Relativity is doing is distributing those films for us so –  Tom Egan with Collins Stewart Okay.  Gregory Maffei  Right. So it’s actually the reverse of that you said.  Tom Egan with Collins Stewart Right. Okay. And the in terms of the overhead, so now Starz Media only incurs 1/3 of the overhead, or 1/3 of the personnel that were transferred. Is that right?  Gregory Maffei  Well actually, we’re continuing to resolve the staff issues for the rest of Overture’s business because now that we are not in the business of acquiring and distributing films, there’s a lot of clean up that needs to be done. But the need for that staff going forward is for a very limited time.  Tom Egan with Collins Stewart Right. Okay. And the on Starz Network, so clearly that margin was under a little bit of pressure in the first half because of higher programming and marketing costs. So what should we expect for the second half? Thanks.  Gregory Maffei  Well first, we remain comfortable with the estimates we set forth in, I believe it was November at the time we launched the tracker. Our 2010 estimate remains intact. We are still saying 5 to 10% growth, but we haven’t changed that. You can back in to where we are.  Tom Egan with Collins Stewart Yep. Okay. Great. Thank you.  Operator Our next question today comes from Douglas Anmuth with Barclays Capital.  Douglas Anmuth – Barclays Capital  Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you a couple of things around QVC. Mike, first can you provide some more detail in the drivers of the U.S. EBITDA margins and in particular, trying to figure how sustainable these are going forward excluding effects of the GE Credit deal.  And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about the trajectory of sales during 2Q and perhaps so far into the third quarter and how you’re thinking about the back half? Thanks.  Michael George Sure, Doug. On EBITDA, as I mentioned, you know, we saw some enhancement in initial product margins as the mix of the business shifted away from some of the lower-margin categories. As you know, I’m always low to try to predict product margins because it just really depends on what the consumer is engaged with. And so if we see consumer electronics really explode in the back half of the year after a bit of a lull in Q2, and we are excited about some of the innovations that are starting to get to market. This was a very innovation-bare period. You know, that would make the product margin look one way, but it would also probably help our sales line, so we’d probably be looking at s somewhat lower rate but maybe more attractive sales. And if we’re in the heavy apparel cycle, we could get the invert. So I try to shy way from being real predictive around product margins.  The other things that empowered the EBITDA were a nice gain in -- a nice reduction in the obsolescence rate. We’ll continue to manage inventories tightly. We probably saw a little bit bigger improvement in Q2 than we might see on an average basis. And then we’ve just had pretty good leverage of our fixed costs line.  So a long way of saying, I don’t know if every quarter we can see the kind of improvement in EBITDA rate that we saw in Q2. That’s an unusually high rate of improvement. But probably the biggest unknown for us is, you know, what’s the product mix look like and how do you sort of trade off sales growth versus product margin rate.  And then as you noted, we do have to kind of adjust EBITDA going forward for the impact of the GE deal.  In terms of sales trajectory, I also always hate to talk about, you know, sort of sales trends within a quarter because we’re so influenced by the programming calendar that it’s a little bit hard to get a read on it. But I think it’s fair to say in Q2, April was the toughest month, and that we’ve seen a decent improvement in the business as we went through the quarter. I don’t know that that reflects any underlying improvement in the economy. I think it probably reflects more our ability to try to get a response to what became a bit of a slowdown in those months and try to adjust our product mix accordingly.  So we were pleased with our ability to respond and to see some improving momentum as we went through the quarter. You know, I’ll shy away from commenting on end-quarter results, just given our policy on that. Although, we did disclose that our Christmas in July event at the end of July was very strong. How predictive is that of Q4 sales? Again, a little bit hard to say, but it did tell me that the consumer was a bit bored with the summer and with all the sales in traditional retail. And when we put on a lot of innovation at Christmas in July, we got a really terrific result with the 14% growth that weekend.  So you know, we’re going to continue to try to present that sort of innovation and see if we can’t power some sales in the back half.  Tom Egan with Collins Stewart Great. If I could just follow up real quickly on the GE situation. And obviously I understand the positive effects in terms of cash and everything going forward, but how should we think about this in terms of revenue? That part seems a little cloudier.  Michael George There’s no material impact, but Dan O’Connell, do you want to just comment on that?  Dan O’Connell Well, I think what we can expect going forward is hopefully as the economy recovers, a reduction of the bad debt rate, which is about 8% on that portfolio, and we did increase the APR on the card at the beginning of the year. And we’re seeing some revenue growth from that.  So I don’t think we’ll see much acceleration in the growth. The portfolio itself has grown by about 20 million from end of the year. Average account balances are up slightly and I guess in the current economic environment we’re seeing a little bit more in revolving activity on the card.  So it’s hard to predict how that will play out in the balance of the year, but I would say the portfolio is performing well right now and will continue to do so.  Gregory Maffei  And I would add also that the income from the card is not captured as a component of revenue. It’s a reduction of SG&A expense.  There shouldn’t be any impact to revenue on the top line.  Dan O’Connell  If I could add one more thing on the operating margin, if you look historically over the last couple of years, Q2 has tended to be a seasonally high operating margin. I don’t know whether that’s product mix or what, but we tend to have the highest operating margins, or among the highest operating margins in Q2. So that’s when you look sequentially that that’s a great -- really the best test.  Tom Egan with Collins Stewart Okay, that’s great. Thank you.  Operator And our final question today will come from Douglas Anmuth with Barclays Capital. I apologize. Our final question today comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi.  Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Thanks so much. How are you?  Gregory Maffei  Good.  Jason Bazinet - Citigroup I have a question for Mr. George on QVC. Earlier this year at the analyst day you were kind enough to sort of share with us the trends in the bad debt expense and the write-off rates of the Q-card as well as Easy-Pay. I think in the release that you issued this morning, you said that the bad debt expense did pick up a bit. Is the same thing true for the Q-card and the Easy-Pay write-off rates? Michael George Dan, why don’t you take that one?  Dan O’Connell  Yeah, I mentioned a minute ago that the bad debt rate on the Q-card was about 8%, that’s up from about 7.4% last year. And I believe for the year-to-date period, up about 2.4 million in write-offs on the Q-card.  Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Okay. And can I ask a conceptual question? This is going to sound negative and it’s really not meant to be.  When I sort of think about how well you guys performed in the downturn and how well you’re performing now relative to sort of the buy-side expectations. And I listened to the number of new customers that you’re getting, is it possible that you all have sort of found a new sweet spot, if you will, by being a bit more flexible in terms of credit you’re willing to extend to people, or you know, whatever other screens you use in terms of credit scores?  In other words, in an environment where other retails are being more restrictive and scared, you sort of opened up the envelope a little bit. Is that a fair characterization, or would you say that’s a misguided notion?  Michael George Well, I would say on, you know, we extend credit in two ways. One is through our Q-card and we have not fundamentally changed or loosened up the screening; and if anything on the margin, it’s probably a little tighter as we went through the recession. We were already fairly tight, so we didn’t have to respond as aggressively as other people did. And the issuance of our Q-card has been about stable or even down slightly.  So I would say that as a general statement, while people are revolving more, to Dan’s point, we’re not fundamentally increasing the usage of credit on the Q-card.  The other vehicle we use is Easy-Pay, where we will offer two to six installments on higher price-point purchases. We have used that a little bit more during the recession, and I think that’s been an effective tool for us. Although having said all of that, at the conceptual level, do I think credit access is meaningful in the story about performance? Probably not. I wouldn’t put that, in my own judgement, as one of the top drivers of getting incremental market share. I really do think at the core of the market share is driven more by the fundamentals of I think a better level of product innovation, more entertaining programming and really this focus on the Internet.  And when you look at that 21% growth in revenue from the Internet in the U.S., that’s really a huge number; meaningfully different from other people in this space. And I think that just is continuing to entice more people to both get incremental purchases from QVC customers but also entice more new customers to the platform. Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Okay. Thank you very much.  Gregory Maffei  Operator, with that let us end the questions and we’ve gone the hour. Thank you to all who are listening for your interest in Liberty again. And I will look forward to seeing you next quarter, hearing from you. Thank you.  Operator  And that does conclude today’s Liberty Media Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer Mr. Gregory Maffei. Please go ahead, sir. Gregory Maffei Thank you very much and thank you all on the call today for joining us and your continued interest in Liberty Media. Today speaking on the call, besides myself, we’ll have our controller Chris Shean; the QVC CEO, Mike George and the Starz CEO, Chris Albrecht. Also assembled here we have several senior Liberty QVC and Starz executives and we’ll all be available to answer questions after the prepared remarks. So turn to slide three in the Q3 highlights. I think we had another strong quarter with solid operating performance across our businesses led by our strong management teams. We had good progress at the Liberty level, we think towards improving our clarity and moving forward on some structural items. At Liberty Media we filed the preliminary proxy for the split off of Liberty Capital and Liberty Starz. Prior to the split off, the Time Warner exchangeable debentures, the principal amount of which is $1.1 billion will be reattributed from Liberty Capital to Liberty Interactive along with cash and the stock underlying the exchangeable which is approximately 21.18 TWX shares, 5.5 million TWC shares and 2 million AOL shares. Looking at Liberty Interactive, QVC again displayed good strength in operations. Revenue was up 7%, adjusted OIBDA was up 8%. Predictably notable was the fact that adjusted OIBDA included $9 million dollars of startup expense for Italy which had not been in the prior year. As you may recall, we launched Italy on October 1 st,  you’ll hear more about all of that from our CEO, Michael George. The revenue growth attribucacy was impressive in many ways. It outperformed the industries for the mid-market luxury department stores, specialty and discount retailers. And notable, once again, we grew QVC.com’s business, the online portion of our business, much faster than Comscore and the major video commerce competitor as we have for the several last few quarters. Importantly, we continue to add new names. (Inaudible) stock for future growth and on a structural level, we refinanced QVC’s bad credit facilities, extending maturities, lowering rates and providing us more flexible security. QVC continues to reduce leverage. Since Q1 2010, LINTA has reduced leverage by almost $1.4 billion dollars. QVC’s leverage ratio at the end of Q3 was approximately 1.9 times. And after the close of the quarter, in fact yesterday, we paid down an additional $250 million dollars against the revolving credit facility although I note we may need to withdraw some of this prior to year-end. In the LINTA category as well our eCommerce companies posted excellent 19% revenue growth. Once again we outpaced Comscore’s eCommerce growth estimate for Q3 of 9% by a substantial amount. Looking at Liberty Starz, adjusted OIBDA went down slightly year over year primarily due to the timing of certain marketing and release expenses and original programming expenses. Chris will go into those in further detail, Chris Albrecht. Despite that, we remain comfortable with our 2010 guidance, which we offered up in November of 2009. The guidance range of 3% to 4% growth in revenue and 5% to 10% growth in OIBDA. But I would note, we think that OIBDA growth will be near the low end of the range. We did also complete a new affiliation agreement with DISH, importantly a multi-year agreement. We increased subscriber accounts both sequentially and year over year versus declined in some of the other premium categories. And we changed the attribution of Starz Media from Liberty Capital to Liberty Starz, better reflecting, in our judgment, how we operate the businesses. Starz Media results will be part of the attributed Liberty Starz income statement beginning in Q4 and the Liberty starts balance sheet that we issued at the end of Q3 includes the Starz Media assets and liabilities. Lastly at Liberty Capital, Sirius XM was the largest asset in Liberty Capital once again posted very strong financial results driven by excellent operating performance including [Tram 3500 net adds] expect to end the year with over 20.1 million subscribers. [ARPU] was up 6%. [Churn] was down to 1.9%. The conversion rate was up to 48.1% versus 46.2% last year and the Sirius stock price is trading at about $1.51 or $1.52, flirting back and forth which values our equity stake in excess of $3.9 billion dollars. Also notably in the corner we recap at Liberty Capital. We repurchased $156 million dollar’s worth of stock from July 31 st  to actually October 29 th , so a little past the end of the quarter. And yesterday, as was reported on the Live Nation earnings call, we completed the purchase of 2.5 million shares of LYV at $9.62 per share. We bought those shares from Mr. Diller the former chairman for total consideration of $24.4 million dollars and that increased our stake in Live Nation to about 15.8%. With that I’m going to turn over to Christopher Shean to let him first talk about the (inaudible) financial results in more detail. Christopher Shean Thanks Greg. Liberty Interactive Group’s revenue increased 8%, $2 billion dollars in Q3 while adjusted OIBDA increased 8% to $373 million dollars. QVC, which the primary driver of these results increased total revenue by 7% to $1.8 billion dollars while adjusted OIBDA increased 8% to $369 million dollars. Liberty Interactive’s other eCommerce businesses grew 19% for the quarter. Overall revenue growth was partially offset by lower commission revenue earned when customers sign up for third party online discount services. During Q1 a decision was made as we had reported previously to change the way these promotions are offered which had the impact of reducing the revenue earned from these services. These changes are expected to continue to adversely impact commission revenue throughout 2010. Revenue earned from the commissions yield significantly higher margin than regular product sales, therefore this reduction has a more negative impact on adjusted OIBDA on a percentage basis. Furthermore during the quarter, increased marketing expenses helped grow revenue in new customer names but negatively impacted adjusted OIBDA margins. Adjusted OIBDA for the eCommerce businesses increased $3 million dollars to $10 million total for Q3. During the quarter we deconsolidated lockers based on a change in the government of the entity. On an apples to apples basis, if you were to back out the lockers results from the prior year, Q3 2009, adjusted OIBDA for the eCommerce business was relatively flat year over year. Now let’s take a quick look at LINTA’s equity picture. At the end of Q3 the group had attributed cash and public investments of $4 billion dollars and $6.2 billion dollars of attributed debt. QVC’s total debt to adjusted OIBDA ratio as defined in their credit agreement was approximately 1.9 times as compared to the maximum allowable leverage of 3.5 times. QVC’s gross leverage is down significantly from its peak in 2008. Now we’ll have Mike George provide some additional comments on QVC. Michael George Thank you Chris. We were very pleased with the strong and balanced results we achieved in Q3 with consolidated revenue increasing 7% and adjusted OIBDA increasing 8%. Every market showed strong gains in sales and adjusted OIBDA in eCommerce mix and in new customer growth rates. In the US we grew revenue 7% and adjusted OIBDA 8%. And OIBDA would have increased 10% excluding the impact of the change in our [Q-card] agreement. We saw strength across a number of categories including kitchen, cook, floor care, domestics, holiday, consumer electronics, computers, apparel, accessories and beauty. Our US eCommerce business continues to outpace overall internet retail sales with growth of 18%. QVC.com now represents 31% of US sales, up three points from last year. We also continue to add new customers in the US at a strong pace with revenue from new customers increasing 11% in the quarter; our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit new customer revenue growth. Our adjusted OIBDA margin increased slightly, driven by lower inventory (inaudible) charges and improvements in customer service productivity. Partially offsetting these gains were higher marketing expenses associated with our fashions night out pop up studio at Rockefeller Center. Adjusted OIBDA was also impacted by our new [Q-card] agreement which went into effect August 2 nd . As we discussed on our last call, this new arrangement freed up $500 million dollar receivable (inaudible) which was used to pay down outstanding debt and reduced our exposure to the potential bad debt of this portfolio. If the prior agreement were still in place, our adjusted OIBDA would have been $5 million dollars higher. Turning to international, we saw outstanding results in our existing markets with international revenue up 8% and adjusted OIBDA up 17% in local currency. Excluding the impact of Italy startup costs. The UK had another good quarter following a strong rebound in Q2 with revenue up 6% and adjusted OIBDA up 9% in local currency. The apparel, beauty, gift and consumer electronics businesses were particular standouts. The improvement in adjusted OIBDA was driven primarily by fixed cost leverage. In Germany we posted one of the strongest results in several years with revenue up 9% and adjusted OIBDA up 25% in local currency. Growth in the home and accessories category was especially strong. The adjusted margin increased 210 basis points, driven by gains in initial product margins as we shifted the mix away from consumer electronics (missing audio) expenses. Japan had another great quarter with revenue up 9% and adjusted OIBDA up 14% in local currency. Fashion and beauty businesses all turned in strong performances. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 125 basis points driven primarily by reductions in carriage expenses following the renegotiation of several cable contracts earlier this year. We incurred a $9 million dollar adjusted OIBDA loss in Italy as we ramped up our hiring in preparation for our October 1 st  launch. Now we’ve been pleased in these first few weeks since launch with the quality of execution in Italy and the positive feedback we’ve received from customers, vendors and the press on both the caliber of the programming and products. Initial sales have been a little softer than we anticipated but we’re encouraged by our week over week sales ramp. In contrast with our past channel launches, QVC Italy launched in a digital channel environment and we know it takes longer for views to find us in a digital lineup. We’re also experiencing some issues with households receiving our channel. Now that may be impacting the visibility of our channel in up to half of our DTT homes. There are a number of issues behind that but this will improve as Italy moves through the analog transition over the next year. We know it will also take some time to find the right product mix and begin to build a repeat customer base. Although we’re encouraged that initial results are showing repeat buy rates consistent with those of new customers in other markets. So despite these short term challenges, we do remain very confident in the potential of the market and that we continue to expect our 2010 full year OIBDA loss to be within our prior guidance of $30 million to $40 million. And with that background by market I’ll close with a few overall comments on the business. Our customer growth funnel is strong. With worldwide revenue growth from new customers up 12% in constant currency and every market achieving growth in both new customers and total customer count. Now we believe our sustained success over several quarters driving share gains relative to the retail market, increasing spend with our existing customers and growing new customer revenue at high levels speaks for our progress in creating a highly differentiated destination shopping experience. We were particularly encouraged by the overwhelming positive customer and press reaction to our pop up store and studio in Rockefeller Center for Fashion’s Night Out. We treated our customers to 17 hours of live programming over six days, extensive community engagement through Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and QVC.com, multiple in person customer events and most importantly great products from leading designers, stylists and celebrities including Issac Misrahe, Lori Goldstein, Rachel Doug, Mark Bauer, Jamie Bryant and the Kardashians. This type of disruptive marketing and highly immersive customer experience clearly differentiates us from traditional eCommerce and brick and mortar competitors. And the strong results from the premier of our Liz Claiborne New York apparel line, our National Gem Gallery programming done through an exclusive partnership with the Smithsonian and Chef Gordon Ramsey’s cookware line, all point to the power of exclusive products, compelling programming, engaging guests and unique stories. We also continue to enhance our multimedia platforms and drive strong eCommerce growth at rates that significantly outpace the industry. In Q3 worldwide eCommerce growth was 19% in constant currency. With every market increasing their eCommerce mix we now provide our live programming on four screens; TVs, PCs, SmartPhones and as of mid-October the iPad. Now we also launched our second channel in Germany, Q Plus on September 1 st  and our second channel in the UK, which features the best of our beauty programming on October 26 th . And we’ve completed a controlled customer beta of our new global eCommerce platform which we anticipate beginning to rollout in Q1. And in addition to the strong top line growth, we anniversaried significant increase in adjusted OIBDA margin last Q3 with further OIBDA rate improvements in every market this Q3. These OIBDA gains reflect our constant focus, operating our business efficiently and maintaining tight control over inventories and expenses. And with that I’ll turn it back to Chris. Christopher Shean Okay, let’s move onto Liberty Starz. Liberty Starz attributed revenue grew 5% in Q3 to $319 million dollars while adjusted OIBDA decreased 3% to $89 million dollars. At quarter end, Liberty Starz had attributed cash and public holdings of almost $1.2 billion dollars and attributed debt of $99 million dollars. These cash and debt figures are post the change of attribution of Starz Media to Liberty Starz. Now Chris Albrecht will comment on events, Starz Entertainment and Media. Chris Albrecht Thank you. Q3 of (inaudible) continued solid operation performance (inaudible) with positive revenue growth and another quarter of subscriber gain albeit modest. (Inaudible) Encore overall (inaudible) operating results (inaudible) certain economic environments. (Inaudible) Chris Albrecht Yeah. Gregory Maffei We’re having a hard time hearing you. I’m not sure about the rest of the line. When we did the test it was fine but now it’s quite garbled. Why don’t we have Bill read it and see if you can find another line? And if we get clarity we’ll have you come in. Chris Albrecht Okay. Gregory Maffei But Bill should pick up maybe back a paragraph. Thanks Chris. Bill Myers I’ll go back and just start from the beginning since we got a little rotten start there. Q3 marked continued solid operating performance for Starz Entertainment with positive revenue growth and another quarter of subscriber gains, albeit modest at Starz and Encore. Overall we are extremely pleased with our operating results and believe our business (inaudible) in this soft and uncertain economic environment. Regarding Starz Media we can make significant progress during Q3 and our stated pursuit of seeking strategic alternatives for certain non-core assets. Liberty also brought the financial structure of the two star entities more in line with their operational alignment to attributing the Starz media assets from Liberty Capital to Liberty Starz. Let’s go into a little more detail on Starz entertainment. Revenue at Starz Entertainment increased by $15 million for Q3 to $316 million, an increase of 5%. Growth and subscription units with consignment deal based partners, higher effective subscription rates and international television and home video revenue associated with original program, primarily our Spartacus Blood and Sand series, accounted for the increase. Adjusted OIBDA was relatively flat. Increased expenses associated with the original series, the pillars of the earth, and Spartacus higher move programming costs due to stronger box office performance from our first run output partners and cost associated with revenue earned on original program including increased amortization accounted for the relatively flat OIBDA performance. The flagship Starz and Encore channels subscriber total both increased over Q2 2010 by 100 thousand in Q3 to 17.4 million and 32 million respectively. Additionally these figures represented the first year over year subscriber increase since Q1 2009. In October we entered into a new multiyear deal with Dish Network that expands the relationships with one of our largest customers. The DISH affiliate agreement offers distribution of all the Starz Entertainment channels and advanced services. This agreement reflects the flexible approach we are taking without affiliates by leveraging the strong mix of exclusive Starz movie programming and the compelling Starz originals found across our family of channels and services. The new DISH network affiliation pack follows in the footsteps of last quarter’s deal announcement with Comcast. Both agreements distribute our Starz online, Encore online and MoviePlex online services and leverage the increased industry roll out of authenticated online (inaudible) everywhere initiatives. We are continuing to engage in similar discussions with other key affiliates. Looking at original programming, we were very pleased with the solid performance of Q3 original even series, The Pillars of the Earth. In addition to positive critical reviews and strong interest from our affiliates, each hour episode averaged more than 2.8 million viewers across all platforms. In 2011 our Starz original schedule will be as follows, the Spartacus prequel, Spartacus Gods of the Arena; we’ll follow that up with Camelot where we retain all US pay TV rights including digital and home entertainment and Torchwood, which is a ten episode series based off the hit (inaudible). Given Andy Whitfield’s unfortunate recurrence of cancer, a question mark hangs over our original programming plans, however, which is the second season of Spartacus. Although we are exploring the option of recasting the lead character, there is no guarantee we will wind opponent going that route. This does not reflect any wavering in our support for the property. To the contrary, because we have such great respect for the franchises creative integrity, we take the challenge of recasting the role of Spartacus very seriously. We expect to make a decision later this quarter and whatever it is, the decision will be a prudent one that factors in what is best for the show and best for Starz. As we have discussed, Starz Entertainment is continuing to explore multiple alternative financing models to assist in financing our acceleration into the (inaudible) space. Meaningful dialogue with potential partners continues but as noted previously this process will take several more months before we come to a final resolution. Shifting over to Starz Media, let’s first review the financial performance. Revenue for the quarter increased by $33 million to $89 million while adjusted OIBDA improved from a loss of $71 million in Q3 of 2009 to a loss of $6 million in Q3 of 2010. Improved quarter revenue performance was primarily attributable to the timing and number of theatrical releases at Starz media and Overture films along with the related fluctuations of theatrical, home video and television revenue and related expenses associated with these numbers. Given the shutdown of Overture films, we do not expect Starz media to incur future annual operating losses of the same magnitude as recent years. As mentioned, we made great strategic progress with Starz Media in Q3 and in the period leading up to today’s call. On September 30 th  of 2010 a change in attribution of the Starz Media business from the Liberty Capital (inaudible) stock group to the Liberty Starz (inaudible) stock group went into effect and thus brought a cleaner financial and operating structure for the combined businesses of Starz Entertainment and Starz media. Last month we reached an agreement to sell the film, Roman animation studio to a group of investors led by former film Roman president Scott Greenberg. We are optimistic that that deal will close by the end of 2010. And I addition, we continue to look at strategic alternatives for Starz Media remaining animation studio and we will keep you apprised of that progress as the quarter progresses. Now I will turn it back to Chris. Chris Albrecht Thanks Bill. Taking a look at Liberty Capital, during the quarter, Liberty Capital revenue increased 47% to $251 million dollars while adjusted OIBDA was $25 million dollars. Primarily due to the number and timing of films released by Starz media and Overture films. The Liberty Capital group had attributed cash and public investments of $8 billion dollars and attributed debt of $1.9 billion dollars. From July 31 st  through October 29 th , 2010 Liberty purchased 3.3 million shares of LCAPA common stock at an average price of $46.61 for total cash consideration of $155.5 million dollars. Cumulative repurchases since the reclassification of the tracker represent 36.6% of those original shares outstanding. Now the following item, you’ll see in our 10Q disclosures that will get filed later today, in 2009 Liberty settled various variable share forward sale contracts relating to Sprint and Century Link shares using borrowed shares. Liberty entered into those contracts in 2001 and received almost 1.2 billion dollars in connection with the settlement of such contracts in 2009. Liberty treated the settlement as an open transaction and deferred approximately $1.2 billion dollars of gain for income tax purposes. For financial statement purposes, we recorded approximately $421 million dollars of deferred income tax liabilities for this item. In connection with its review, out 2009 tax return, the IRS questioned whether the gain realized on the settlement of the forward sales contract should be deferred. In October 2010, the IRS and liberty reached an agreement with respect to this issue. This agreement resulted in Liberty making current federal tax payments of $210 million dollars yesterday. For financial statement purposes, Liberty expects to record a current tax expense for this $210 million dollars and record a deferred income tax benefit of $421 million dollars in Q4 of 2010. As a result of this agreement, Liberty will be able to unwind the related share borrowing arrangements by delivering shares that it actually owns without incurring any additional federal taxable income. With that said I’ll now turn the call back over to Greg. Gregory Maffei Thanks Chris and thank you to Mike and Chris briefly and Bill Myers on the fill in for your updates on the respective businesses. I think we’re looking at slide nine, the Q3 Summary and Outlook. I feel that our businesses continue to post strong results in the face of an uncertain economy. Our priority as we finis 2010 and look forward to 2011 include Liberty Media continuing to progress, or make progress, on the split off of Liberty Capital and Liberty Starz and Liberty Interactive exploiting what we see as the many QVC growth opportunities including new markets and across new platforms. As Mike George talked about, continuing to look for eCommerce investments and acquisitions. We mentioned our desires but also our difficulties in finding those historically. And continuing to rationalize our non-core investments. Reality is we are focusing our business at Liberty Interactive on video and eCommerce and things that don’t fit into that portfolio as well are probably not part of the business for the long term. At Liberty Starz we continue to hope to drive our cost effective original programming to differentiate and strengthen the Starz business and brand and we will evaluate opportunities for what to do with the cash and to improve our balance sheet management. At Liberty Capital we expect to continue to deploy or invest our excess capital. You’ve seen us do that (inaudible) in investments and in repurchase and I expect those will be the two primary (inaudible) going forward. And again, at Liberty Capital we have a select group of non-core investments to rationalize. With that, let me thank you for your continued interest in and support of the company, Liberty Media and operator, let’s open it up for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions.) And we’ll go ahead and take our first question from Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Great, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to first ask about Starz where it was a bit of a surprise to see that the rising cost but I was wondering, from here, how do you see costs? Do you see them trending flattish or is there a continued step function like we saw in Q3 over Q2? Gregory Maffei I’ll give a more general view and then I’ll let Bill Myers and Glen Curtis the CFO, give the real answer. You know, I think you’re seeing that we have one of the challenges with original programming is the lumpiness and the reality is we also have original programming that’s given to us by the movie creators and (inaudible) the studios with who we have output deals. And the timing of those can fluctuate but we still feel good about the long-term trend that we will have increased leverage on our content businesses and content costs if we are smart and clever about how we operate the business. So as I noted, while we see that lumpiness, we still feel good about the guidance we gave 12 months ago, albeit at the low end and not all the factors are in our control but those that we can manage, I think we’ve managed well. Bill. Bill Myers Yeah, I’m sure there’s much more to add there, I mean I think just for a little more detail, we have some movie content in this quarter from our output partners that was incredible strong; things like UP and 2012, so it does put us in that position where we will have peaks and quarters where we have really good times. And we showed (inaudible) this quarter which gave us a little bit more regional content this period then we had in the prior years. But, yeah, I agree with Greg, overall we still feel that we have the right programming mixed with originals and first runs. Gregory Maffei If you could just comment on the Spartacus launch as well because that had an impact on the quarter. Glenn, maybe you want to talk about that? Glen Curtis We released the DVD for Spartacus domestically on September 21 st  so we had cost associated with that release. Primarily marketing costs and also the inner company distribution fees that we have on efforts Starz Media. And so because we only had one week of revenue really in this corner, we had costs that exceeded that by about $3 million dollars. We would expect the marketing cost to set up future revenue in Q4. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Okay, great. And then if I could ask one other question on the other Liberty Interactive (inaudible), one of the issues that came out of the HSN report was (inaudible) from really importing products, shipping (inaudible) from overseas, which has been an issue for some other retailers and at HSN it was mainly in their catalog segment, Corner Stone. Are you guys seeing anything like that or there something about your model that basically shields you from those shipping cost pressures? Gregory Maffei Mike, do you want to cover that? Michael George We’re not seeing any meaningful pressure. Most of the inbound freight in our model is paid for by the vendor. We do some direct importing but it’s a minority of the business and we have good long-term relationships and so far have not seen any meaningful cost pressure. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Okay, great. I’ll leave it there. Thank you. Operator And we’ll take our next question from Doug Anmuth from Barclays Capital. Doug Anmuth – Barclays Capital Thanks for taking the question. Two things for Mike; first I was hoping you could comment on the trajectory during Q3 and what you’re seeing here and thinking about in terms of macro for Q4 and then secondly, if you could comment on the higher gross margins in Germany and just provide some more details there on what drove such a big list. Thanks. Michael George Sure, you know, in terms of Q3 I tried to shy away from month to month comparisons because it’s so influenced by our programming calendar but I would kind of characterize the quarter as fairly stable overall. I wouldn’t say there was an obvious trajectory one way or the other. As usual I’ll avoid any comments on our own business in Q4, so I don’t have a lot to add to the holiday outlook for the industry other than what we kind of all saw with yesterday’s same store sales announcements. October was a fairly difficult month for the industry and just from my reading of the external reports and what I’m hearing, it was some combination of the unusually weather spell as well as I think folks just been an uncertain economy taking kind of a breather between fall spending and holiday spending. And October can be like that; it can be a hard month to get a real read on because it’s a little bit in between. But that’s my limited insight on the overall market and again, I’ll kind of shy away from QVC references. In terms of Germany the single biggest impact, I believe, was the reduction in the mix of the consumer electronics business. You may recall that in Q2 we had good top line growth but we were not happy with our bottom line growth and felt that we had moved the business a little too aggressively to consumer electronics and needed a healthier balance. So we’ve been working on that for several months and I think the team really did a nice job of rebalancing the business and stabilizing margins. The other secondary impact is that, this is part of sort of the long term program to improve the health of the Germany business been really improving our inventory management and as a result of that, reducing our markdown levels and we once again saw the percentage of business done at markdown levels is down in the quarter and the percentage of business done at full price, up. So I think those are the two primary drivers of the margin boost. Actually a third I would mention is we did see, our inventory levels came down in the way our obstellence (ph) modeling works, you know if inventory is down, you’ll incur less of an inventory charge. That element of it is heavily timing driven. When in the month or in the quarter do you receipt the product. But that’s a little more timing driven. The other two are more kind of fundamental to the mix of the business. Doug Anmuth – Barclays Capital Okay, great. Thank you. Operator And we’ll go ahead and take our next question from Tom Egan with Collins Stewart. Tom Egan – Collins Stewart Great, thank you. I realize it’s early but I was wondering if you could provide maybe a little bit of color on the expected accounting treatment for any of the new partnership original deals? For example, would you think that the cash payment and the amortization would both be split by a partner? Gregory Maffei If you think about obviously where early in those partnerships, the contact partnerships, I think the idea would be that, yes, it would be very attractive financially for Starz on several levels. First we believe more scale and output of original programming as a positive. Sharing those costs and the amortization for those is obviously a positive as well in terms of us finding a known de-risk partner, de-risk set of revenue streams for any original programming as we produce it. And then lastly we think there’s probably some upside in our receiving incremental revenue and fees from the partnership for distribution of the product across different platforms including DVD. Tom Egan – Collins Stewart Right. Gregory Maffei I think there are a lot of ways it could be very beneficial if we’re able to complete that partnership. Tom Egan – Collins Stewart So with Camelot and Torchwood, are these series that you expect to be shared. Chris Albrecht Greg can you hear me? Gregory Maffei Chris, yes great. We’re clear now. Chris Albrecht Okay, on Torchwood it’s pretty much a standard core production deal and the same thing with Camelot with treaty money on top. What we’re doing looking forward is to try to put together a structure that we can put all original programming through and maybe create some one off partnerships within that as well. But Torchwood and Camelot are things that we have looked at kind of outside of what we hope to be a more, you know, holistic strategy going forward. Tom Egan – Collins Stewart Right, okay. And then I just have a question on the repurchase. Obviously the stock’s been strong through the summer and the fall and I can see why it’s hard to maybe find the right price to repurchase it at, but is there anything structural that’s prohibiting you or any reason why you wouldn’t have bought back any of the shares (inaudible) the quarter. Gregory Maffei Tom, to make sure, you’re talking about shares of Liberty Starz? Tom Egan – Collins Stewart Yes. Gregory Maffei No, there’s nothing structural. I think we’ve outlined some of the reasons why we’re putting some other pieces in place and some of our thinking about what we want to do with the capital and that’s probably been rather than (inaudible) telling we’re trying to make some broader decision. Tom Egan – Collins Stewart Right, okay. Thank you. Operator And we’ll go to our next question with James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital Afternoon folks, thanks for- well morning I guess, thanks for taking the question. Two of them, first of all is Chris on the call? Was he able to reconnect again? Chris Albrecht Yeah, I’m here. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital Hi, you talked in the past about the prospects of being able to sell over the top services to various customers in various content, can you sort of talk about some of the options you have in terms of how you’d put those packages together and what the variables around them in terms of timing and content of new versus library in the like would be? Chris Albrecht Well, I don’t know if you were at our investor day presentation, but what we showed was the various products that Starz, Encore, MoviePlex packages are broken down into now and we also talked about achieving price parody for the same product across the distribution platform that includes traditional and new media distribution platforms. And so we’re investigating our arrangements will all distributors based on that product line and we’re in conversations now with the appropriate people. Some conversation early, some people are early in their plans. Obviously there’s been a lot of speculation around our Netflix arrangement and we continue to talk to them. So we’re out talking to the appropriate people and we think we have the appropriate strategy. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital And Greg, one for you if I could. I know it’s kind of unfair to ask a coach, so what do you do if you lose the game although it seems to be okay in politics to ask people what are you going to do when you lose the house, but in the event that you don’t get a declaratory ruling in your favor in Delaware, what do you do then? What sort of appeals process do you have and on the flip side if you do get that ruling what sort of appeals process or risk to finality could there be from one of the protesting bondholders? I’m basically just trying to get a handle on how long someone could string this process out if they wanted to? Gregory Maffei Well when you’re dealing with a litigation process there is no absolute certainty. Our hope would be for a fairly quick ruling sometime in February with the potential for appeals either way by ourselves or the other side that might stretch it out to as late as May. What would we do? Well there are obviously, well first of all we’re confident in our case, but in the event that we were to lose (inaudible) on appeal, I certainly think there are alternatives. We could imagine restructuring the deal. The argument would be largely about how we, as under the (inaudible), remove substantially all the assets and all businesses. So you could imagine situations in which less portions of the business are split off. That seems like the obvious remedy, I’m sure there are others as well. May would be the time we would think an appeals process would end. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital Great, thank you. Operator And we’ll go to our next question from David Gober with Morgan Stanley. David Gober – Morgan Stanley Thanks for taking the question, guys. I guess this one’s for Chris or Bill on the new DISH agreement. Just curious if you could kind of talk about how the authentication works there. Is this going to go through DISH’s TV Everywhere portal or whatever they’re building or is it something where their customers have to authenticate through a Starz Play website or something like that? Gregory Maffei Bill, why don’t you take that. Bill Myers This will go through their portal and they’ll handle all the authentication on their side. We are not establishing a separate location, if you will, where they would exit and go to a Starz separate website. So it will be all handled inside the DISH network. David Gober – Morgan Stanley And I know it’s difficult to comment on individual deals, but I as just curious if you could give us any detail, or I guess to ask differently; were there any major changes to the structure of that deal or is it relatively similar to traditional deals that you guys have done with DISH? Gregory Maffei I guess the real positive is it’s a relatively long deal, which is a positive for us. And what we have done with them, that’s a little bit different than where we are now. We have to move them more into a flat rate structure with agreed upon increases that work economically for us and works economically for them and allows them to use our product. So it’s a little bit different than where we’ve been historically on the Starz side where we’ve been a consignment deal. David Gober – Morgan Stanley Great, and Chris, just to clarify some of the comments that you made about new entrance into digital distribution, just curious if those conversations have gained any urgency or if some of these p layers seem to be closer to launching or closer to actually coming to market with a product or existing services that maybe have gained some urgency on acquiring more content. Chris Albrecht I certainly wouldn’t use the word urgency, but I think that there’s an increased level of activity as people start to focus their plans about how they will answer this (inaudible). So there certainly are more than a couple of people to talk to. But any discussions are certainly in early stages. David Gober – Morgan Stanley Great, and I just had a couple for Greg as well. Gregory Maffei Two more please because we don’t want to have a monopolization of the queues. Go ahead. David Gober – Morgan Stanley So just to clarify on the Sprint piece, I think you mentioned that this allows you to basically unwind some of the potentially some of the borrowed shares that you put on there. Does this also cover the 2010 (inaudible) that come off or is that something that’s a separate issue? Gregory Maffei No, our settlement with the IRS and our payment of about $210 million dollars and release of about [$420 million] dollars of liabilities, it only relates to 2009. 2010 is still open and all the prior years will remain closed. So this is only just related just to the 2009. And as you know, the release of the shares really has no impact economically; it just means we’ve settled the issue. We get no further benefits from the shares or cost. David Gober – Morgan Stanley Great, I’ll leave it there, thanks. Operator And we’ll go to our next question from Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. One, can you talk, you’ve always had a lot of runway internationally being able to enter new markets after other people have gone in and haven’t implemented as successful (inaudible), you’ve got some deep pocketed guys in Asia now, Korea, you know particularly who are pretty aggressive. I know there are some markets that you just aren’t going to go into for various governmental reasons. But can you talk about the (inaudible) of competition there and then lastly can you give us more clarity on eventual share repurchase activity (inaudible). Gregory Maffei Mike I’ll let you handle the first part and maybe I’ll handle the second. Michael George Sure, the I mean you’re right that in Asia there are certainly some strong competitors that are trying to expand into new markets, certainly a number of the Korean players are either looking at or expanding into China, India, Taiwan, other markets. I would say that’s a consideration for us, but we do believe that if we have to stay true to our model, we can make it work and you know, when you look at it, we have almost never been first competitor. Maybe never, and usually we enter our market, including the US market well after a number of other folks have entered. So we try not to get too distracted by what other folks are doing although we certainly pay attention to it. We continue to stay on our agenda which is, you know, we’d love to at some point expand further in Asia. We certainly think China is a very attractive and promising market, although not without a number of difficulties and issues. We also love India although again, challenges and probably a little further out. There are still places in Europe that we’d like to go like France. We’d love to get a foothold in the America’s at some point, like Brazil. So we continue to explore all those options fairly actively but as I always caution when I talk about this, the timing of finding the right opportunity, the right partner, is very difficult to predict and you know we really have pretty high standards as to what it needs to look like. And so we’re okay waiting until the right deal emerges. So we continue to look seriously at international expansion in all those regions. And some of those regions there is more competition but I wouldn’t say that’s a significant concern for us. Gregory Maffei And on share repurchase, I think as a practical matter, until a resolution of some of our issues around the eventual split off, we’re probably less likely to be doing share repurchase. Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities Thank you. Operator And we’ll go to our next question from John Teeker with Maxim. John Teeker – Maxim Thank you. You mentioned you’d bought out (inaudible) in Live Nation, and you’re now up to nearly 16%. I wonder if you could just talk a little about how you see that business. They reported yesterday in the numbers were not strong and how are you sort of intend to affect change given I think you’re going to go up two more seats in your limit is to which committees you can sit on at the moment. Thanks. Gregory Maffei Well, you know, I think we tried to help out the former chairman there by taking his shares but we still look at that business as interesting. And while there clearly is a transition there, we have a reasonable good size stake, the largest stake in the business. Two board members as you noted including the (inaudible) chairman who may wish to add any commentary on this. The- I think the direction of the business is that they have some challenges related to both the consumer environment, current consumer environment and discretionary spending as well as some challenges related to technology and investments that they need to make on the ticket side. But that we think the business has some interesting long-term characteristics and is well positioned. And we think your management team is on track to do some of the right things. John Teeker – Maxim: Operator And we’ll go to our next question from Martin   Pyykkonen   from   Wedge Partners. Martin Pyykkonen – Wedge Partners Yeah, thanks, good morning. Question on Starz about the capital structure considering the comment that was made about several more months to consider and evaluate different options. If that’s the expectation, should we be thinking that at least through the first quarter, maybe first half of next year that they basically own leverage in the capital structure would stay the same as Starz as we see it today until you do figure that out? Is that a fair assessment? Gregory Maffei I don’t think we have a set time frame. I think we watch the lawn market and the appealing rate at which companies can issue debt including high yield issuers and are quite attractive and on the other hand we still have not yet entirely figured out what we would do with that incremental cap. So we’re weighing those two pieces but I don’t have a set date. Martin Pyykkonen – Wedge Partners Okay, and then one quick question on (inaudible) related to (inaudible) considering where (inaudible) is at over a dollar fifty I know you’re not going to say if and when and what manner you might do anymore in terms of buying in or increasing your stake. Could you just talk kind of qualitative about the NLL situation in terms of as it maybe continues to go higher how you evaluate that, you know imputed costs versus losing the NOL’s or some portion, the sooner you might make move rather than waiting to fully capture those. I’m just curious how you’re (inaudible). I know it’s complicated from a tax standpoint. Gregory Maffei Yeah, it’s quite complicated as you rightly noted. There are several factors that one of the factors is what’s called a 382 Limitation. The success of Sirius has sort of taken that off the table as an issue because they’re (inaudible) has grown so large, the NOL becomes left to the factor in the waiting. So I don’t think that that is much of an issue. There are a ton of issues around our contractual issues with them about when we can increase our stake and how. There are some tax issues related if we were to ever go for a higher percentage, how we could utilize those NOLs or whether they’d become what is known as surely, which would limit potentially our use of them. And there’s a practical matter, there’s the reality that this stock is run an ungodly amount and, you now, the valuation is, well we have every (inaudible) in this business, valuation is something you might argue they need to grow into. We shall see. But we remain very excited about the long-term prospects for Sirius. But it’s lets crisp about what we will do. Martin Pyykkonen – Wedge Partners Okay, thank you. Operator And we’ll take our final question from Murray Arenson with BGB Securities. Murray Arenson – BGB Securities Thank you, good morning. I just wanted to ask a couple related questions on QVC just to try to get a feel for some of the newer technology things you had going on. The iPad application you mentioned, the mobile website, talk a little bit about how those are going and how we might see an impact from those. And along those lines, maybe as things get more electronic and internet entwined, is there a- does that change at all your approach to customer service? Can we see some changes along that side of the equation as well? Gregory Maffei Sure, we did launch our iPad application a couple weeks ago so I encourage everyone on the call to download it and you can have QVC with you 24 hours a day. And it’s a very compelling app, but it’s a fairly basic app at this stage, we’ll do a lot to enhance it, but just that mobility element to our business, I think is very meaningful because it does mean that you we’ll just get more time with our customer because she can now access us anywhere at any point with a beautiful HD quality view and experience and rich content as well. And we’ve barely begun to imagine the possibilities of that kind of a device. We’re really making QVC a portable experience on both rich media and content. And we will be launching our mobile optimized, the next version of our mobile optimized website in a few weeks along with another round of specialized iPhone apps that target specific customer niches and I think that’s sort of the next generation of these apps is to have highly specialized apps that go after communities of interest within the overall QVC family. So there’s a lot happening on that front. I think it’s hard to predict the exact impact on our business other than we do think it just helps us stay highly relevant, helps us grow the business with existing customers and new customers. We continue to believe that our eCommerce business, inclusive of mobile apps will hit or exceed 50% in the US by 2014. So a pretty meaningful mix shift. We’re also experimenting with some things on the interactive front with our cable partners although those are early stages, but we’ll be testing next year. But we think the core strategy is really these mobile applications and the ability to interact both with the TV viewing experience as well as the mobile viewing experience through an interactive app on your phone and on your iPad. So we think it just expands the market, expands the viewing time, expands the opportunity for us. And, you know, it certainly has some impact on customer service, we’ve obviously seen generally speaking the number of calls coming into our phone centers, order entry calls is, you know, growing at a much slower rate than our internet growth. That’s a good thing from a cost standpoint. And generally people that make a purchase online may also be more inclined to transact their customer service in a self-service mode online so we continue to work on upgrading the quality of our self-service tools on the website. I haven’t done all of that, you know, we always find that the best customer is one who engages with us across all channels including the phone. Our 20-year customer service veterans do an amazing job of engaging the customer and creating a great experience. So we kind of like the fact that folks still call in from time to time even if they’re heavy internet users. Murray Arenson – BGB Securities Great, thank you, I appreciate the color. Gregory Maffei Well, thank you to all of the questioners and all the listeners for their interest in Liberty. Thank you to all the presenters on the call today. We look forward to another good quarter, I hope to speak to you again in three months if not sooner. Thank you. Operator This concludes today’s Liberty Media Corporation quarterly earnings conference call. Thank you for attending and have a good day.

The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions.) And we’ll go ahead and take our first question from Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Great, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to first ask about Starz where it was a bit of a surprise to see that the rising cost but I was wondering, from here, how do you see costs? Do you see them trending flattish or is there a continued step function like we saw in Q3 over Q2? Gregory Maffei I’ll give a more general view and then I’ll let Bill Myers and Glen Curtis the CFO, give the real answer. You know, I think you’re seeing that we have one of the challenges with original programming is the lumpiness and the reality is we also have original programming that’s given to us by the movie creators and (inaudible) the studios with who we have output deals. And the timing of those can fluctuate but we still feel good about the long-term trend that we will have increased leverage on our content businesses and content costs if we are smart and clever about how we operate the business. So as I noted, while we see that lumpiness, we still feel good about the guidance we gave 12 months ago, albeit at the low end and not all the factors are in our control but those that we can manage, I think we’ve managed well. Bill. Bill Myers Yeah, I’m sure there’s much more to add there, I mean I think just for a little more detail, we have some movie content in this quarter from our output partners that was incredible strong; things like UP and 2012, so it does put us in that position where we will have peaks and quarters where we have really good times. And we showed (inaudible) this quarter which gave us a little bit more regional content this period then we had in the prior years. But, yeah, I agree with Greg, overall we still feel that we have the right programming mixed with originals and first runs. Gregory Maffei If you could just comment on the Spartacus launch as well because that had an impact on the quarter. Glenn, maybe you want to talk about that? Glen Curtis We released the DVD for Spartacus domestically on September 21 st  so we had cost associated with that release. Primarily marketing costs and also the inner company distribution fees that we have on efforts Starz Media. And so because we only had one week of revenue really in this corner, we had costs that exceeded that by about $3 million dollars. We would expect the marketing cost to set up future revenue in Q4. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Okay, great. And then if I could ask one other question on the other Liberty Interactive (inaudible), one of the issues that came out of the HSN report was (inaudible) from really importing products, shipping (inaudible) from overseas, which has been an issue for some other retailers and at HSN it was mainly in their catalog segment, Corner Stone. Are you guys seeing anything like that or there something about your model that basically shields you from those shipping cost pressures? Gregory Maffei Mike, do you want to cover that? Michael George We’re not seeing any meaningful pressure. Most of the inbound freight in our model is paid for by the vendor. We do some direct importing but it’s a minority of the business and we have good long-term relationships and so far have not seen any meaningful cost pressure. Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets Okay, great. I’ll leave it there. Thank you. Operator And we’ll take our next question from Doug Anmuth from Barclays Capital. Doug Anmuth – Barclays Capital Thanks for taking the question. Two things for Mike; first I was hoping you could comment on the trajectory during Q3 and what you’re seeing here and thinking about in terms of macro for Q4 and then secondly, if you could comment on the higher gross margins in Germany and just provide some more details there on what drove such a big list. Thanks. Michael George Sure, you know, in terms of Q3 I tried to shy away from month to month comparisons because it’s so influenced by our programming calendar but I would kind of characterize the quarter as fairly stable overall. I wouldn’t say there was an obvious trajectory one way or the other. As usual I’ll avoid any comments on our own business in Q4, so I don’t have a lot to add to the holiday outlook for the industry other than what we kind of all saw with yesterday’s same store sales announcements. October was a fairly difficult month for the industry and just from my reading of the external reports and what I’m hearing, it was some combination of the unusually weather spell as well as I think folks just been an uncertain economy taking kind of a breather between fall spending and holiday spending. And October can be like that; it can be a hard month to get a real read on because it’s a little bit in between. But that’s my limited insight on the overall market and again, I’ll kind of shy away from QVC references. In terms of Germany the single biggest impact, I believe, was the reduction in the mix of the consumer electronics business. You may recall that in Q2 we had good top line growth but we were not happy with our bottom line growth and felt that we had moved the business a little too aggressively to consumer electronics and needed a healthier balance. So we’ve been working on that for several months and I think the team really did a nice job of rebalancing the business and stabilizing margins. The other secondary impact is that, this is part of sort of the long term program to improve the health of the Germany business been really improving our inventory management and as a result of that, reducing our markdown levels and we once again saw the percentage of business done at markdown levels is down in the quarter and the percentage of business done at full price, up. So I think those are the two primary drivers of the margin boost. Actually a third I would mention is we did see, our inventory levels came down in the way our obstellence (ph) modeling works, you know if inventory is down, you’ll incur less of an inventory charge. That element of it is heavily timing driven. When in the month or in the quarter do you receipt the product. But that’s a little more timing driven. The other two are more kind of fundamental to the mix of the business. Doug Anmuth – Barclays Capital Okay, great. Thank you. Operator And we’ll go ahead and take our next question from Tom Egan with Collins Stewart. Tom Egan – Collins Stewart Great, thank you. I realize it’s early but I was wondering if you could provide maybe a little bit of color on the expected accounting treatment for any of the new partnership original deals? For example, would you think that the cash payment and the amortization would both be split by a partner? Gregory Maffei If you think about obviously where early in those partnerships, the contact partnerships, I think the idea would be that, yes, it would be very attractive financially for Starz on several levels. First we believe more scale and output of original programming as a positive. Sharing those costs and the amortization for those is obviously a positive as well in terms of us finding a known de-risk partner, de-risk set of revenue streams for any original programming as we produce it. And then lastly we think there’s probably some upside in our receiving incremental revenue and fees from the partnership for distribution of the product across different platforms including DVD. Tom Egan – Collins Stewart Right. Gregory Maffei I think there are a lot of ways it could be very beneficial if we’re able to complete that partnership. Tom Egan – Collins Stewart So with Camelot and Torchwood, are these series that you expect to be shared. Chris Albrecht Greg can you hear me? Gregory Maffei Chris, yes great. We’re clear now. Chris Albrecht Okay, on Torchwood it’s pretty much a standard core production deal and the same thing with Camelot with treaty money on top. What we’re doing looking forward is to try to put together a structure that we can put all original programming through and maybe create some one off partnerships within that as well. But Torchwood and Camelot are things that we have looked at kind of outside of what we hope to be a more, you know, holistic strategy going forward. Tom Egan – Collins Stewart Right, okay. And then I just have a question on the repurchase. Obviously the stock’s been strong through the summer and the fall and I can see why it’s hard to maybe find the right price to repurchase it at, but is there anything structural that’s prohibiting you or any reason why you wouldn’t have bought back any of the shares (inaudible) the quarter. Gregory Maffei Tom, to make sure, you’re talking about shares of Liberty Starz? Tom Egan – Collins Stewart Yes. Gregory Maffei No, there’s nothing structural. I think we’ve outlined some of the reasons why we’re putting some other pieces in place and some of our thinking about what we want to do with the capital and that’s probably been rather than (inaudible) telling we’re trying to make some broader decision. Tom Egan – Collins Stewart Right, okay. Thank you. Operator And we’ll go to our next question with James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital Afternoon folks, thanks for- well morning I guess, thanks for taking the question. Two of them, first of all is Chris on the call? Was he able to reconnect again? Chris Albrecht Yeah, I’m here. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital Hi, you talked in the past about the prospects of being able to sell over the top services to various customers in various content, can you sort of talk about some of the options you have in terms of how you’d put those packages together and what the variables around them in terms of timing and content of new versus library in the like would be? Chris Albrecht Well, I don’t know if you were at our investor day presentation, but what we showed was the various products that Starz, Encore, MoviePlex packages are broken down into now and we also talked about achieving price parody for the same product across the distribution platform that includes traditional and new media distribution platforms. And so we’re investigating our arrangements will all distributors based on that product line and we’re in conversations now with the appropriate people. Some conversation early, some people are early in their plans. Obviously there’s been a lot of speculation around our Netflix arrangement and we continue to talk to them. So we’re out talking to the appropriate people and we think we have the appropriate strategy. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital And Greg, one for you if I could. I know it’s kind of unfair to ask a coach, so what do you do if you lose the game although it seems to be okay in politics to ask people what are you going to do when you lose the house, but in the event that you don’t get a declaratory ruling in your favor in Delaware, what do you do then? What sort of appeals process do you have and on the flip side if you do get that ruling what sort of appeals process or risk to finality could there be from one of the protesting bondholders? I’m basically just trying to get a handle on how long someone could string this process out if they wanted to? Gregory Maffei Well when you’re dealing with a litigation process there is no absolute certainty. Our hope would be for a fairly quick ruling sometime in February with the potential for appeals either way by ourselves or the other side that might stretch it out to as late as May. What would we do? Well there are obviously, well first of all we’re confident in our case, but in the event that we were to lose (inaudible) on appeal, I certainly think there are alternatives. We could imagine restructuring the deal. The argument would be largely about how we, as under the (inaudible), remove substantially all the assets and all businesses. So you could imagine situations in which less portions of the business are split off. That seems like the obvious remedy, I’m sure there are others as well. May would be the time we would think an appeals process would end. James Ratcliffe – Barclays Capital Great, thank you. Operator And we’ll go to our next question from David Gober with Morgan Stanley. David Gober – Morgan Stanley Thanks for taking the question, guys. I guess this one’s for Chris or Bill on the new DISH agreement. Just curious if you could kind of talk about how the authentication works there. Is this going to go through DISH’s TV Everywhere portal or whatever they’re building or is it something where their customers have to authenticate through a Starz Play website or something like that? Gregory Maffei Bill, why don’t you take that. Bill Myers This will go through their portal and they’ll handle all the authentication on their side. We are not establishing a separate location, if you will, where they would exit and go to a Starz separate website. So it will be all handled inside the DISH network. David Gober – Morgan Stanley And I know it’s difficult to comment on individual deals, but I as just curious if you could give us any detail, or I guess to ask differently; were there any major changes to the structure of that deal or is it relatively similar to traditional deals that you guys have done with DISH? Gregory Maffei I guess the real positive is it’s a relatively long deal, which is a positive for us. And what we have done with them, that’s a little bit different than where we are now. We have to move them more into a flat rate structure with agreed upon increases that work economically for us and works economically for them and allows them to use our product. So it’s a little bit different than where we’ve been historically on the Starz side where we’ve been a consignment deal. David Gober – Morgan Stanley Great, and Chris, just to clarify some of the comments that you made about new entrance into digital distribution, just curious if those conversations have gained any urgency or if some of these p layers seem to be closer to launching or closer to actually coming to market with a product or existing services that maybe have gained some urgency on acquiring more content. Chris Albrecht I certainly wouldn’t use the word urgency, but I think that there’s an increased level of activity as people start to focus their plans about how they will answer this (inaudible). So there certainly are more than a couple of people to talk to. But any discussions are certainly in early stages. David Gober – Morgan Stanley Great, and I just had a couple for Greg as well. Gregory Maffei Two more please because we don’t want to have a monopolization of the queues. Go ahead. David Gober – Morgan Stanley So just to clarify on the Sprint piece, I think you mentioned that this allows you to basically unwind some of the potentially some of the borrowed shares that you put on there. Does this also cover the 2010 (inaudible) that come off or is that something that’s a separate issue? Gregory Maffei No, our settlement with the IRS and our payment of about $210 million dollars and release of about [$420 million] dollars of liabilities, it only relates to 2009. 2010 is still open and all the prior years will remain closed. So this is only just related just to the 2009. And as you know, the release of the shares really has no impact economically; it just means we’ve settled the issue. We get no further benefits from the shares or cost. David Gober – Morgan Stanley Great, I’ll leave it there, thanks. Operator And we’ll go to our next question from Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan – Wunderlich Securities Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. One, can you talk, you’ve always had a lot of runway internationally being able to enter new markets after other people have gone in and haven’t implemented as successful (inaudible), you’ve got some deep pocketed guys in Asia now, Korea, you know particularly who are pretty aggressive. I know there are some markets that you just aren’t going to go into for various governmental reasons. But can you talk about the (inaudible) of competition there and then lastly can you give us more clarity on eventual share repurchase activity (inaudible). Gregory Maffei Mike I’ll let you handle the first part and maybe I’ll handle the second. Michael George Sure, the I mean you’re right that in Asia there are certainly some strong competitors that are trying to expand into new markets, certainly a number of the Korean players are either looking at or expanding into China, India, Taiwan, other markets.

But that we think the business has some interesting long-term characteristics and is well positioned. And we think your management team is on track to do some of the right things.

Could you just talk kind of qualitative about the NLL situation in terms of as it maybe continues to go higher how you evaluate that, you know imputed costs versus losing the NOL’s or some portion, the sooner you might make move rather than waiting to fully capture those. I’m just curious how you’re (inaudible). I know it’s complicated from a tax standpoint. Gregory Maffei Yeah, it’s quite complicated as you rightly noted.

There are some tax issues related if we were to ever go for a higher percentage, how we could utilize those NOLs or whether they’d become what is known as surely, which would limit potentially our use of them. And there’s a practical matter, there’s the reality that this stock is run an ungodly amount and, you now, the valuation is, well we have every (inaudible) in this business, valuation is something you might argue they need to grow into. We shall see. But we remain very excited about the long-term prospects for Sirius. But it’s lets crisp about what we will do. Martin Pyykkonen – Wedge Partners Okay, thank you. Operator And we’ll take our final question from Murray Arenson with BGB Securities. Murray Arenson – BGB Securities Thank you, good morning. I just wanted to ask a couple related questions on QVC just to try to get a feel for some of the newer technology things you had going on. The iPad application you mentioned, the mobile website, talk a little bit about how those are going and how we might see an impact from those. And along those lines, maybe as things get more electronic and internet entwined, is there a- does that change at all your approach to customer service? Can we see some changes along that side of the equation as well? Gregory Maffei Sure, we did launch our iPad application a couple weeks ago so I encourage everyone on the call to download it and you can have QVC with you 24 hours a day. And it’s a very compelling app, but it’s a fairly basic app at this stage, we’ll do a lot to enhance it, but just that mobility element to our business, I think is very meaningful because it does mean that you we’ll just get more time with our customer because she can now access us anywhere at any point with a beautiful HD quality view and experience and rich content as well. And we’ve barely begun to imagine the possibilities of that kind of a device. We’re really making QVC a portable experience on both rich media and content. And we will be launching our mobile optimized, the next version of our mobile optimized website in a few weeks along with another round of specialized iPhone apps that target specific customer niches and I think that’s sort of the next generation of these apps is to have highly specialized apps that go after communities of interest within the overall QVC family. So there’s a lot happening on that front. I think it’s hard to predict the exact impact on our business other than we do think it just helps us stay highly relevant, helps us grow the business with existing customers and new customers. We continue to believe that our eCommerce business, inclusive of mobile apps will hit or exceed 50% in the US by 2014. So a pretty meaningful mix shift. We’re also experimenting with some things on the interactive front with our cable partners although those are early stages, but we’ll be testing next year. But we think the core strategy is really these mobile applications and the ability to interact both with the TV viewing experience as well as the mobile viewing experience through an interactive app on your phone and on your iPad. So we think it just expands the market, expands the viewing time, expands the opportunity for us. And, you know, it certainly has some impact on customer service, we’ve obviously seen generally speaking the number of calls coming into our phone centers, order entry calls is, you know, growing at a much slower rate than our internet growth. That’s a good thing from a cost standpoint. And generally people that make a purchase online may also be more inclined to transact their customer service in a self-service mode online so we continue to work on upgrading the quality of our self-service tools on the website. I haven’t done all of that, you know, we always find that the best customer is one who engages with us across all channels including the phone. Our 20-year customer service veterans do an amazing job of engaging the customer and creating a great experience. So we kind of like the fact that folks still call in from time to time even if they’re heavy internet users. Murray Arenson – BGB Securities Great, thank you, I appreciate the color. Gregory Maffei Well, thank you to all of the questioners and all the listeners for their interest in Liberty. Thank you to all the presenters on the call today. We look forward to another good quarter, I hope to speak to you again in three months if not sooner. Thank you.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Maffei. Please go ahead, sir. Gregory Maffei Thank you. And thank you all of you for joining us today and for your continued interest in Liberty Media. Today, speaking on the call, we'll have our controller, Chris Shean; we'll also have the QVC CEO, Mike George; and the Starz CEO, Chris Albrecht. Several other senior Liberty, QVC and Starz executives are also on the call, and all of us will be available to answer your questions after the end of the proposed -- or the prepared remarks.  So looking at Slide 3, the fourth quarter and year-end highlights, we had a solid finish to a strong year with good operating performance by our management teams despite a sometimes challenging environment. We had progress at the Liberty level, improving the clarity and completing several structural items which we think move towards that goal. At Liberty Media, we filed our amended proxy for the split-off of Liberty Capital and Liberty Starz. We completed the change in attribution of our 3.125% exchangeable debentures from Liberty Capital to Liberty Interactive and including the stock that underlies those exchangeable 21.8 million Time Warner shares, 5.5 million Time Warner Cable shares and 2 million AOL shares and $263.8 million of cash. We set the shareholder vote for the completion of the split-off for April. We concluded our hearing in Delaware last week in the courts. I think we expect the court to render a decision in about six weeks. From our perspective, the trial seemed to go well, and we remain optimistic of obtaining a favorable outcome. Looking at some of the operating performance at Liberty Interactive. QVC had a solid quarter and a solid year with particular strength in our established, international markets. Notably, QVC Japan exceeded $1 billion of revenue for 2010. That's the first time that we've had a market outside of the United States reach that milestone.  We were pleased with our overall results given the top -- tough comps that we have had from Q4 2009. I'd note that the Q4 results, as we've previously discussed, were impacted negatively by a new agreement with GE Money Bank for the QCard and the launch costs in Italy. Also notably, QVC.com achieved a penetration rate in the U.S. in Q4 of 36%. That's the highest quarterly rate we've had in penetration to date, and QVC.com's penetration for the month of December, which admittedly is typically a high month, exceeded 40%. I would also note we were particularly pleased with the growth and direction of our mobile business. Really, we've just entered that in the last 18 months. We've had several notable launches and great growth on the revenue side.  QVC continues to reduce its leverage. We paid down $300 million of our credit facility during the quarter. And because our leverage ratio at the end of the year was 1.7x, and we have a condition in our indenture which says that if the leverage is below 2x for two consecutive quarters, which has occurred, we now pay lower interest rate on our bank credit facility. Also, with Liberty Interactive, our eCommerce companies posted 27% revenue growth from Q4 with adjusted OIBDA growth of 38%. This is significantly outpacing comScore's eCommerce growth metric, and the action for that for Q4 was about 11%. So we beat it handily. Looking at Liberty Starz. Starz Entertainment exceeded its 2010 revenue guidance and met adjusted OIBDA targets. We were very pleased with the audience response to the Spartacus prequel. We also announced the season two will air in 2012. The Spartacus prequel was the most-watched premium program in the winter quarter, and we're very pleased with that. Not just at Starz but of any premium.  As you may have watched last night, King's Speech fared very well at the Oscars with a four-award grand slam. And through our partnership with the Weinsteins, this will be the first movie we release to our new, as I said, our new home video partnership and distribution agreement with the Weinsteins and we're very pleased. Also notably, we ended the year with a record 18.2 million Starz subscribers and 32.8 million Encore subscribers.  Lastly, looking at Liberty Capital, SIRIUS XM, the largest element within Liberty Capital, posted very strong financial results, driven by excellent operating performance throughout the year. SIRIUS ended the year with over 20.2 million subs, ARPU was up 7%, churn was down to 1.9% and the conversion rate was up to 46.2% versus 45.4% last year. Virtually every operating metric for our subscription business was improving. The SIRIUS stock was up to $1.77. It's actually, I think, up again this morning. That values our equity stake at $4.6 billion as of last Friday.  Also notably in the quarter, we repurchased $185 million worth of LCAPA shares from October 30 to, actually, January 31. We've also agreed – excuse me, we also purchased an additional 1.8 million shares of Live Nation and contracted to purchase an additional 5.5 million shares of Live Nation, subject to approval of the Live Nation shareholders. With the conclusion of both purchases, our ownership in Live Nation will increase to 20.9%. So with those opening comments, let me turn it over to Chris Shean, who's going to talk first about the LINTA financial results. Christopher Shean Thanks, Greg. Liberty Interactive group's revenue increased 6% in the fourth quarter and increased 8% for the year, while adjusted OIBDA increased 1% for the quarter and 6% for the year. QVC increased total revenue about 4% for the quarter and 6% for the year, while adjusted OIBDA at QVC increased 1% and 7% for the quarter and year, respectively. Liberty Interactive's other eCommerce businesses grew 27% in revenue for the quarter and 18% for the year. We note that overall revenue growth was partially offset by lower commission revenue earned when customers sign up for third-party, online-discount services. As we had mentioned in prior calls, during the first quarter of 2010, a decision was made to change the way these promotions are offered, and that decision resulted in reduced revenue earned from those services by $25 million for 2010. Revenue earned from the commissions yield significantly higher margins than normal product sales. And therefore, the reduction of this revenue more negatively impacted adjusted OIBDA on a percentage basis. Furthermore, during the year, increased marketing expenditures helped grow revenue and new customer names but negatively impacted adjusted OIBDA margins. Adjusted OIBDA grew 38% in the fourth quarter and decreased 8% for the year. Growth in the fourth quarter was due to product revenue growth and improved margins with less of a negative impact from the reduction in the commissions revenue. Now let's take a quick look at Liberty Interactive's liquidity picture. At the end of the year, the group had attributed cash and public investments of $3.7 billion and $5.9 billion of attributed debt. If you pro forma that for the change in the attribution of the exchangeable debt that we did in February, cash and public investments will increase by $1.4 billion and the face amount of debt will increase by $1.1 billion, as if they were valued at December 31, 2010. QVC's total debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio, as defined in QVC's credit agreement, was approximately 1.7x, as compared to the maximum allowable leverage of 3.5x. QVC's gross leverage is down significantly from its peak in 2009. And with that, we'll hand the call over to Mike George to provide additional insights on QVC. Michael George Thank you, Chris. In Q4 we successfully anniversary-ed the strong financial results from the prior fourth quarter, and we continued to make progress on our strategic goals to broaden the relevance and accessibility of our brand across platforms, with revenue from new customers up 18% worldwide in the quarter and global eCommerce revenues also up 18%. Now looking at the results by market. In the U.S., our 3% revenue growth in Q4, while down from the trend of the past four quarters, represents a 17% growth rate over the last two years, a result that puts us among the faster-growing large retailers in the U.S. We saw continued strong performance in our beauty, accessories, kitchen and cook, household and consumer electronics categories, partially offset by softness in jewelry. Net revenue was also affected by higher return rates, primarily in our electronics and accessories categories, and lower shipping and handling revenue due to a mix shift to higher ASP products. Revenues from new customers grew 19% in the quarter on top of the 60% growth last Q4, as we continued to broaden the appeal and accessibility of our brand.  Our U.S. eCommerce business grew 17%, well above the comScore sales growth of 11% for Internet retailers. QVC.com represented 36% of our sales, up from 31% last year. Over 50% of our revenue on QVC.com came from products not recently on air, and 64% of our new customers came through QVC.com, continuing to highlight the success of our eCommerce platform in both creating additional purchase occasions with existing customers and attracting new customers. Adjusted OIBDA declined 1% due to the impact of the previously disclosed change in the terms of our agreement with GE Money Bank, as well as challenging comparisons to the prior year when adjusted OIBDA increased 32%. Under the new contract, we share the economics from the credit card program with GE Money Bank. If the prior contract had been in place for the fourth quarter, our adjusted OIBDA would have been $9 million higher, or a 1% increase over the prior year. We expect to see a similar level of impact until we anniversary this change in August. Excluding the impact of the new GE Money Bank contract, operating margins declined 27 basis points with favorability in freight and inventory obsolescence partially offsetting softness in initial margins driven by the continued growth in consumer electronics. Upon the termination of the prior contract with GE, a $501 million deposit with GE Money Bank was returned to QVC. These funds were used to lower interest cost by paying down a portion of QVC's bank facilities. Now looking at the U.K. They had another strong quarter with revenues up 6% in local currency on strength in apparel, accessories, fashion jewelry and beauty. Our eCommerce revenue grew 17%, and revenue from new customers grew 29%. That's one of the strongest new customer performances in several years. Adjusted OIBDA increased 16% in local currency, driven by warehouse and freight efficiencies and fixed-cost leverage. Our German business delivered an outstanding quarter with total revenue growth of 9% and eCommerce revenue growth of 22% in local currency. We saw balanced growth across our home, beauty, apparel and accessories businesses. Adjusted OIBDA increased 18% in local currency, driven in part by strong improvements in initial product margins as we successfully shifted the mix from consumer electronics to the fashion categories. Our Japan business continued to post strong results with revenue up 7% and adjusted OIBDA up 12% in local currency. Our beauty, apparel and accessories categories were especially strong and eCommerce revenues increased 20%. And for the full year, as Greg noted, our Japan business exceeded $1 billion in revenue our first market outside the U.S. to achieve that milestone. And looking at Italy, in our first quarter of operations, we achieved net revenue of EUR 1 million and an adjusted OIBDA loss of EUR 10 million. For the full year, we incurred an adjusted OIBDA loss of EUR 24 million or $32 million. That's on the low end of our guidance of a $30 million to $40 million loss. As I mentioned on the last earnings call, our initial sales were softer than we anticipated due in part to the challenges associated with launching the channel in the midst of Italy's transition from an analog to a digital environment. Nonetheless, we remain very confident about the potential of the market. We see several encouraging signs in our first few months of operation, including strong week-over-week sales increases, 96% customer satisfaction rates, a level of repeat-customer purchasing that already rivals or exceeds that of our established markets and one of the lowest return rates of any country. So we can see that the Italian consumer is responding favorably to our format, which is unique in the market. We expect sales to continue ramping strongly as more viewers discover our channel and as we continue to adjust the product and programming mix to the needs of the market. Now looking at the full year. Now, we're very pleased with our progress broadening the relevance and accessibility of our brand across those countries and platforms and driving strong financial results despite the continued economic uncertainty. For the year, we grew revenues 6% and adjusted OIBDA 10% in constant currency, excluding the onetime impacts of the Italy launch and the new GE Money Bank contract. And we had one of the most balanced results across markets that we've seen in many years, with each market growing revenue in local currency between 5% and 10%, each market increasing their adjusted OIBDA margins and each market growing adjusted OIBDA from 5% to 18 -- to 15%. eCommerce growth worldwide increased 20% to $2.2 billion, making QVC one of the largest and fastest growing general merchandise retailers on the Internet, and every market contributed to the strong eCommerce growth. The count of new customers increased 8% worldwide with strong customer-count growth in every market, and our revenue from new customers increased 11%. Our active customer base in the year was over 11 million globally, including 3 million new customers worldwide. We continued to expand our platforms, launching multiple new smartphone and iPad applications in the U.S.; second broadcast channels in the U.K. and Germany; and broadcast simulcasts on ITV in the U.K. and BS NTV, a leading satellite channel in Japan. And we are now in the process of rolling out iPhone applications in every established market as well as testing several interactive or Internet TV features, and we have close to 40 million homes in the U.S. with access to a second channel placement in the HD tier. We continue to enhance our product lineup with several prestige brand launches in the year. In fashion, we added Liz Claiborne New York, K-Dash by the Kardashians, MOD, and expanded our Isaac Mizrahi and Rachel Zoe brands. In cook, we added chefs Gordon Ramsay, Lidia Bastianich and David Burke, joining Rachel Ray, Paula Deen and others. Our strong beauty lineup expanded with the additions of Josie Maran, Bliss Spa, Fresh Beauty [ph] and Neutrogena's skin care among many others. And we added Dyson vacuums and Vita Mix blenders to our housewares and kitchen mix. We engaged our viewers with several high-profile events, including our pop-up store in Rockefeller Center for Fashion's Night Out and remotes from the Academy Awards, the Aspen Food and Wine Festival and the Smithsonian's National Gem Gallery among many others. We established or broadened partnerships with several leading media outlets, including Vogue, InStyle and Food & Wine.  We successfully launched our business in Italy, our first new market in nearly 10 years, and we continued to actively explore several other markets for potential expansion.  And we continued our multiyear program to remake our global technology infrastructure to better support our growth goals across platforms and countries, personalize the shopping experience and extend our competitive advantage. In 2010, we launched new warehouse-management systems in two of our distribution centers and began rolling out new digital workflow and media-asset-management systems. And this month, we began a phased rollout of our new Websphere eCommerce platform. For the full year, our capital expenditures were $220 million, including investments in our technology platform, the launch of Italy and shifting jewelry to our South Carolina distribution center. We anticipate our capital expenditures for 2011 will be in the range of $280 million to $300 million, including continued investments associated with our technology program, a 1 million square foot expansion of our North Carolina distribution center to handle our growing hard goods volumes in the U.S., and new headquarters facilities in the U.K. and in Japan. With that, I'll turn it back to Chris. Christopher Shean Thanks, Mike. Let's take a look at Liberty Starz. With the attribution of Starz Media to Liberty Starz, the results for Liberty Starz going forward primarily represents the results of Starz LLC. Starz LLC is managed based on the business units of the Starz channels, which is the legacy Starz Entertainment business and as well as home video, television, digital media and theatrical businesses which is the legacy Starz Media business. Liberty Starz-attributed revenue grew 33% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the year, while adjusted OIBDA increased 43% in the quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding Starz Media and corporate and other, revenue for the legacy Starz business increased 5% from 2009 to $1.2 billion and adjusted OIBDA increased to $407 million, up 6% for the year.  At quarter end, Liberty Starz had attributed cash and public holdings of $1.1 billion and attributed debt of $105 million. These cash and debt figures are post the change of attribution of Starz Media to Liberty Starz, as well as a net settlement of $150 million paid to the Starz founder and former CEO, the final settlement of his SAR agreement. Now I'll have Chris Albrecht comment more specifically on events in Starz. Chris Albrecht Thanks, Chris. Good morning. Starz completed a strong 2010 that saw Starz Entertainment, our premium TV business, achieve historical highs in revenue, OIBDA and year-end subscribers to the flagship Starz and Encore channels. Having completed my first year at the company, I'm pleased to note the continued positive momentum our businesses are achieving heading into 2011. Starz enjoys a robust share of exclusive, first-run movie programming and with the increased visibility of our Starz Original series, we're positioned favorably in the overall, competitive marketplace. We continue to look at the online, video distribution market for opportunities to distribute our programming while remaining mindful of historical relationships with our traditional distribution affiliates. We'll approach new opportunities creatively, yet prudently, with an eye towards seeking agreements that specifically price and package our content in ways on par with that of our traditional distributors. Shifting to specific performance and discussion. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, Starz Media became attributed to the Liberty Starz tracking stock group. As a result, Starz Entertainment and Starz Media businesses are now more closely aligned. Specifically linking the two companies provides us a cleaner operating and financial structure. Unless otherwise specified, the 2010 financial performance metrics I'll share are for Starz LLC and contains Starz Entertainment results for the full year and Starz Media results for the three months ended December 31, 2010. Those used for comparison in 2009 are only that of Starz Entertainment. Starz 2010 financial and operating performance showed growth across the board. With respect to our two flagship services, Starz ended the year at 18.2 million subs and Encore at 32.8 million subscribers, which are both all-time highs. Revenue for Starz LLC increased in comparison to 2009 by 11% to $1.3 billion, primarily due to the fourth quarter addition of the Starz Media businesses. Starz Entertainment's 2010 revenue increased 5% to $1.2 billion for the year, largely due to the increases in the average number of subscribers to our channels; associated increases in subscription rates; and ancillary revenue from our original programming driven substantially by Spartacus: Blood and Sand, the international television syndication and North American home video sales. Starz LLC's OIBDA grew by 8% to $415 million. Starz Entertainment's OIBDA rose 6% to a total of $407 million. The increase in OIBDA is due to increases in the average number of subscriptions to our channels; associated increases in subscription rates; ancillary revenue from our original programming, partially offset by higher programming expenses related to increased airings of original programming in 2010; and the addition of Starz Media businesses in the fourth quarter. Starz LLC's operating and SG&A expenses increased in 2010 by $105 million to $914 million, an increase of 13%, of which $74 million was specific to the reattribution of Starz Media. The majority of the remaining increase of $31 million was attributable to higher programming expenses related to increased airings of original programming in 2010. We believe that, subject to inherent risks associated in forecasting theatrical output content, our total programming expenses should rise by modest amounts for the foreseeable future. Our expanded investment in original programming is important on many levels, including driving new subscriber growth, decreasing churn levels, increasing Star (sic) [Starz] brand awareness, creating a hedge against changes in the economics and consumption patterns of movie programming, and raising the profile of our entire suite of premium channels and services.  We continue to make progress in evaluating potential alternative financing models to assist in our acceleration into originals. While dialogues with potential partners continues in earnest, the process is ongoing and could take several months before conclusion. Our goal is to expand Starz Originals over the next few years in order to deliver 50 to 60 hours of new content annually.  Regarding relationships with distributors, we recently extended our affiliation deal with AT&T U-Verse. This agreement includes rights to our suite of authenticated online services, Starz online, Encore online, and Movieplex online. We look forward to capitalizing on ongoing discussions with other multichannel affiliates on the TV Everywhere initiative in 2011 and extending the distribution of our movies and original programming across all platforms. Now let's take a little finer, closer look at our 2011 original programming efforts, our first as the year-round original programming service. The Starz franchise -- The Spartacus franchise continues to be a true success story for the company. Spartacus returned in January with the Spartacus: Gods of the Arena prequel. The series’ performance picked up right where Spartacus: Blood and Sand left off in terms of buzz and viewership. It averaged 3.3 million viewers per episode on the flagship Starz channel for the first half of the six-episode prequel. This original series was a true success story for Starz, receiving more viewers per episode, on average, than any other series in premium television this winter.  In the digital space, this series is also a success in the social media arena, as we registered our millionth fan for the show on Facebook earlier this month. The Spartacus: Gods of the Arena Facebook social media game, announced in early January, is also performing well with approximately 870,000 registered users. Spartacus: Blood and Sand, season one, had a very strong video and DVD and Blu-ray in both hard goods and electronic formats. The title was one of the most successful DVD season one TV launches since 2008, trailing only True Blood and Glee in its first 10 weeks. Spartacus: Gods of the Arena will arrive later this year on DVD, Blu-ray and in digital retail. As to the future of the franchise, we were delighted to introduce Liam McIntyre as the new title character. Production will get underway this spring, and we expect the second season of Spartacus to return to Starz next year.  Now to Starz's next original series, Camelot. This is a modern day reimagining of the Arthurian mythology. The new series debuts on Starz April 1 with a special two-hour block. It stars Joseph Fiennes, Eva Green, Jamie Campbell Bower. And Starz retains all the U.S. pay-TV rights, including digital and home entertainment, for the 10 episodes. Torchwood will follow this summer, entitled Torchwood: Miracle Day. It's a 10-episode original series, which is the next chapter and a new starting point for the hip BBC science fiction franchise. Starz own the exclusive U.S. pay TV rights for Torchwood.  The original series Boss will round out our 2011 original programming schedule. It's going to air in fourth quarter. Boss was a much sought-after media property that we're fortunate to have secured for our original slate. It stars Kelsey Grammer. It’s a political drama focused on the Machiavellian politics of Chicago and the vaunted political machine. And for that one, we also own the exclusive U.S. pay-TV rights. We also made news in December on a future project entitled Magic City. And although this won't air until 2012, we're committed to 10 episodes of a first season. Magic City is set in the heart of Miami at the close of the 1950s. It’s a sexy, exciting drama that’s character-rich and reflective of the times and locale. Now over to Starz Media. In early January, we entered into a multiyear, multiplatform distribution agreement with The Weinstein Company for up to 20 titles per year. This comprehensive home video and digital entertainment deal leverages the distribution and sales infrastructure of Anchor Bay and covers DVD, Blu-ray and electronic digital distribution but does not include television rights. As Greg mentioned, the critically acclaimed, Oscar award-winning film, King's Speech, will be the first title distributed through the agreement. We were also pleased with a separate transaction selling a 25% stake in Starz Media to The Weinstein Company. As for our animation businesses, the previously announced agreement to sell Film Roman did not close, and we are exploring other expressions of interest in our animation businesses. Of course, we'll update you with our progress on the next call. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris. Christopher Shean Thanks, Chris. Turning to Liberty Capital. Liberty Capital group's revenue decreased 41% to $91 million in the fourth quarter and increased 9% to $708 million for the year. Adjusted OIBDA loss decreased $76 million for the fourth quarter and $98 million for the year. Liberty Capital group had attributed cash and public investments of $9.1 billion and attributed debt of $1.9 billion pro forma for the change in attribution of the exchangeable debt. In February, cash and public investments will decrease $1.4 billion and the face amount of debt will decrease by $1.1 billion as they were valued at December 31, 2010. From October 30, 2010, through January 31, 2011, Liberty repurchased 3 million shares of LCAPA common stock at an average price of $60.76 per share for total cash consideration of $185.1 million. Cumulative repurchases since reclassification of the tracker represent 39% of the original shares outstanding.  I want to point out that our Form 10-K will be filed later today. And as you will see in that 10-K, Liberty Capital recorded an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter, a rather large one. This was due to the settlement that we had mentioned with the IRS in last quarter's call, as well as the following transaction: In 2005, we acquired all of the equity in two corporations in tax reorganizations. For tax purposes, our outside tax basis in the shares of these corporations was approximately $1.3 billion. We were required to recognize as a deferred tax asset only the tax basis of the assets held by the two corporations, which is known as “inside tax basis,” and this was a significantly lower amount than the outside tax basis. As of December 2010 -- or in December 2010, we sold all of the stock of these two corporations and realized a capital loss, which is now sitting as a capital loss carryforward, of approximately $1.3 billion. For financial statement purposes, this resulted in the recognition of this federal income tax benefit of $462 million, but such amount is based on the difference between the outside tax basis realized and the inside tax basis which was recorded historically. I should point out that our 2010 income tax return positions are being reviewed by the IRS, and although we believe these positions that we intend to take are appropriate, there is no assurance that we will prevail if the IRS and we were to dispute these positions. With that said, I'll turn the call back over to Greg for some concluding remarks. Gregory Maffei Thanks, Chris, and thank you, Mike and Chris, for your respective updates. I believe that our businesses are continuing to perform well and to post strong results in despite what is still a challenging and uncertain environment for the consumer, particularly here in the United States. Our priorities for the balance of 2011 include, at the corporate level, continue to make progress on the split-off between Liberty Capital and Liberty Starz. We're seeking a private letter ruling; we’re out with a proxy; the trial is moving forward. On all fronts, we believe we're progressing towards the goal we sought. At Liberty Interactive, I think you saw QVC continues to exploit growth opportunities both in new markets and on new platforms, and that's the focus for the balance of the year. We'll continue to grow our eCommerce business’ strong organic growth, and we continue to look for new opportunities to build those businesses with acquisitions or investments. We'll continue to focus on rationalizing on noncore investments in Liberty Interactive, and we'll look for ways to invest what I believe will be the large amount of liquidity that Liberty Interactive will be generating over the next two and three years.  At Liberty Starz, you've heard a lot about our original programming efforts. We believe that finding ways to cost-effectively develop compelling, original programming is critical to differentiating and strengthening Starz, and we're on our way. We're looking to build and enhance our existing relationships with existing and new distributors, and we will evaluate opportunities for cash and balance sheet management at Liberty Starz as well. And lastly, at Liberty Capital, first and foremost, we have much excess capital and liquidity to invest, thinking of ways to the deploy out of our noncore investments, reinvest smartly that cash, that liquidity is job one. And as I mentioned, we still have noncore investments which we need to rationalize efficiently.  We appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media and your support. Stay tuned, and thank you for listening. And operator, let's turn it over to some calls. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets. Barton Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC The first thing I was interested in asking about was the sub growth at Starz, which was remarkable, adding so many subs, really I think the most subs since the third quarter 2007. I was wondering if you could you talk about what was behind that and the sustainability of it. I mean, is this something that is attributable to excitement around originals and successful renewals? Or is it just kind of a lumpy phenomenon that doesn't really continue into the first quarter in particular? And then, secondly, you've got revenue leverage on this. Or are these really subs coming through flat rate deals? So if you could address that, that'd be helpful. Gregory Maffei I'll let Chris Albrecht handle that. Chris Albrecht Yes, we are optimistic about continued growth because we believe that this growth just sort of demonstrates what we've been talking about, which we think that there is for Starz a real opportunity in the existing premium-television universe. And we have been able to work with our distributors to market our products, I think, more effectively and more consistently. And I think in part that's because we have a good story to tell, not with just our theatricals but obviously with our emerging originals.  Obviously, we are managing our expenses into this original programming expansion. And so, certainly, the increased revenue does help our ability to create leverage room for Starz.  This isn't attributable to any one thing. This is just really good business on the part of the Starz sales team and their corresponding teams that are distributors. Barton Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC And part of my question there was the visibility into the first quarter. Is this continuing, the sub growth? Chris Albrecht Bill? Bill Myers is there and will have any information. They don't report. I think it's probably too early to have any new information. But if we do, Bill Myers will be the one who has seen whatever emails. William Myers Chris, I agree with you. It's too early at this point in time. I guess the one thing I would say is that if you would look at the Starz growth over the last 12 months, it's about 50-50 between a fixed-rate deal and what we're seeing in consignment because we're having continued strong growth with our telco [telecommunications] partners. And if you look at Encore, it's probably more like 65% is really on the consignment side as we're starting to see some of our consignment affiliates really use the Encore products as it is a terrific product. But it's too early for us to tell what's going on in the first quarter. Gregory Maffei So Barton, to summarize, we've got -- I think, original programming has helped. The structure of our contracts had driven some of the sub growth, but there is true organic, real sub growth as well. Operator From BTIG, we'll hear from Richard Greenfield. Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC I just wanted to follow up on Barton's question, then I have one other. There's been fear over the past year that Comcast and some of your other distributors were upset or didn't like the fact that Starz's content appeared on Netflix. But with Starz and Encore subs growing so nicely, is that investor concern simply misplaced? And then, two, you've got -- including marketable securities, I think we tally around $1.3 billion, actually, of net cash and securities on your balance sheet now for Starz. Given the sub growth, the EBITDA growth, when should we expect you to make a decision on using some of that cash either to return to shareholders or simply to do something with it versus just sitting there? Gregory Maffei So on the first point I think we -- this is Greg -- we discussed in the past that the entrant of over-the-top competitors, Netflix being the most visible, has caused friction with our existing distributors the way that new entrants often do, and it's incumbent upon us to try and work with the existing distributors and the new entrants. I give credit to the Starz team for having improved the general tone of those relationships and set the right direction that we want to be a good partner, because it's in our interest to be a good partner. Most of our product is on consignment, and we need those cable partners, those telco partners, those satellite partners to drive our business and make both of us money. So we're very conscious of that. We're working through that and I think you're seeing some of the good results. Does that mean that all the friction is gone? No. But it's something that we're trying to manage and be thoughtful about. I'll let Chris comment and add anything on that, and then I'll come back and talk about the cash. Chris Albrecht Yes. I mean, we realize that the original Netflix deal was controversial. Certainly, it has attracted a lot of attention. As it’s been widely reported, we're having an opportunity to look at that deal going forward in these next months. And we maintain that what we need to work on is a product-price parity for the different Starz, Encore and MoviePlex products. And that's the focus that we have. I don't think that our numbers show anything other than “this is a strong category; these are strong brands” and we look to improve performance and growth in all of these sectors. Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC But there's nothing that seems to show that Netflix is hurting Starz, is there, from a subscriber standpoint. Gregory Maffei Our belief is that the vast majority of the people who are subscribing to Starz and subscribing to Netflix are not in competition. It’s either additive or it's a different segment. Now we're not trying to tell the cable guys or the telcos or the satellite guys we know their business better than they do. But that's our perception. Whatever we think, though, is not as important as what our partners think, and we need to work with them to make sure that we're minimizing as much as possible the natural channel conflict that exists. And that's our goal. And I think we've had some success with that. Not perfect but some good success in 2010 and hopefully more in 2011. Now turning to the cash question. Rich, we're just an inherently very conservative company. We don't like leverage much, and we're just hoarding that cash for the day when who-knows-what happens. Now I think we've said before, that was firmly tongue-in-cheek, that we are thoughtful enough what opportunities exist in the marketplace. We're thoughtful about where the business is. And we're going to make a decision, as when we're ready, about what to do with the liquidity at Liberty Starz. And we are mindful of the fact that we have quite a lot of liquidity there, as I noted. No dates today, sorry. Operator Your next question will come from Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc. First of all, Q’s [QVC] really in a unique position relative to the other cable networks, more or less world-turned-upside-down and over-the-top since you're actually paying your cable and satellite partners a percentage of your sales. Is there any benefit over time from all that media distribution conduits you're getting as far as that goes? And can you just talk about it in a broad context? And then also, you said that new customer activity at Q [QVC] was up about 18% on a global basis, which is a pretty resounding number. I mean, is it really just a halo you're getting from all the new apps that are out there? Or what specifically is driving that because that's pretty nice step function improvement? Gregory Maffei Mike, do you want to handle that? Michael George Yes. On the first question about over-the-top and new forms of distribution and whether that benefits Q [QVC], I think over time it does. Clearly, our traditional cable and satellite and now telco partners are critical to us, and we continued to have very good relationships with them. And to your point, it's certainly financially attractive relationships for them as well. But as we add more and more nodes of distribution, I think it just gives us more flexibility to kind of go to wherever the customer is. So we don't -- the nice thing about our model is we don't have a stake in the spite in terms of what form of distribution wins. We just want to be wherever the distribution is. And some forms of distribution are more directed at the customers and therefore less costly for us. But our goal is to be on every relevant platform and wherever the customer is looking for video. And as long as we can sell the product through that platform, we benefit. And certainly, the growth of -- the rapid growth, from a standing start, of platforms like tablets, which are a more attractive viewing option for longer sales -- I think all of that will really benefit us over time. So we think we're in kind of a sweet spot as it relates to this transformation of the distribution environment. In terms of what drove the 18% growth in new customers, we are now on about a, probably a six-, eight-quarter run of really healthy new-customer growth. And I think it continues to be a combination of factors. Part of it is just what products and categories we're offering where, as we to move and more leading brands in categories like consumer electronics and beauty, those or well-known personalities in the fashion arena. Those brands and personalities bring customers with them. A recognizable brand in electronics or a recognizable personality with a big fan following. Those things matter to us, and it's very powerful when some of the personalities we've added to the channel can reach out to their fan base through Twitter and Facebook and expose more people to QVC. So it's the mix of products. It's more new-name, friendly products. It's the power of brands and personalities to drive traffic. And it also points to, I think, a better job that the team is doing with online marketing. Our online marketing team has really risen to the challenge of trying to find creative and ROI-attractive ways. We've always been conservative in online marketing because the ROIs haven't been great. But I will say we're getting better at that and seeing better results. Finally, I would just point to sort of a general increase in the brand halo, positive PR around the brand. I think the brand is just more credible. And some of that historic stigma associated with our format, I think in the last couple of years we've really seen that diminish quite rapidly with the things we've done to elevate our product offerings. So long answer to say I think all of those factors ultimately contribute to the expanded reach. Operator That will come from James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital. James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital Two on Starz, if I could. First of all on Starz Media, it looks like it actually generated positive EBITDA in the quarter, and I'm wondering if that's a trend that we'll see going forward. Is this now a profitable entity? Or is there some onetime stuff going on there, because that certainly hasn't been the pattern in the past? And secondly, Chris, if you could talk about -- for original content, I know you've got an array of the deals on the table that you're working on. But broadly, what sort of rights do you see as you need to have versus ones that you would take on such as DVD and the like, should it make sense? But other than U.S. pay TV rights, are there others that you absolutely need to have in any sort of cooperative deal? Chris Albrecht With regards to the first one, we spent a lot of time and effort this year rationalizing the Starz Media businesses. We've decided to get out of the Overture theatrical film business. And we looked at Anchor Bay as a real strategic asset that, if reattributed to Starz -- we could have that as a growing business, even though, as I said before, maybe the overall sector in the hard goods side isn't necessarily growing. We look at that as a positive growth business for our company. So I would think that with the Weinstein deal, with the growth of originals, certainly the good performance of Spartacus, which we hope to continue, that Starz Media should be a positive story for us for the foreseeable future. Gregory Maffei No, I totally agree with Chris on the direction. We re-architect-ed that business and, I give credit to the Starz team for doing that. Q4 was somewhat of a positive anomaly just because of the timing of events of how expenses were recognized in 2010 and how revenue came in, in Q4. So I don't think you should necessarily extrapolate Q4 as all the good for the future. I agree entirely that we re-architect-ed the business, and I give credit to the Starz management team for that. Chris Albrecht With regards to the right that we're looking to retain, certainly U.S. pay-TV rights are imperative. But as a follow-along to what we just talked about, certainly retaining at least the North American DVD rights seems to be a good strategy for us. Those were rights that we think that we can monetize on their own, but also go to help continue to strengthen the overall Anchor Bay business, which, as I said, is not just a strategic asset for us but one that we hope will be a positive story. And Anchor Bay also supplies the Starz Channels with many films through the Anchor Bay Films division, which go to help us to meet our quotients (sic) for theatrical films with our cable and satellite and telco affiliates. Operator From Morgan Stanley, we'll hear from David Gober. David Gober - Morgan Stanley A couple for Greg, if I could. On the LINTA side, you noted the strong liquidity and cash flow that you guys have at that business. And I was just wondering how you think about the optimal leverage, longer-term, given the cost of capital these days. And also, any sense of when you would consider starting to buy back stuff again, and any blackout periods you might have if you do get -- assuming that you go forward with the spend of LCAPA and Liberty Starz? And then on the SIRIUS side, as the first -- the second anniversary of that deal, I was just wondering if you can kind of walk us through what changes in your flexibility there, and any sense if it would make sense to potentially collar a portion of that stake or take up the overall size of that position. Gregory Maffei First on the LINTA point. LINTA had, like many businesses, a challenging financial picture on the liquidity side right after the Lehman bankruptcy. And at that time, our net leverage in LINTA was $9.6 billion. Today, while EBITDA is up something like $100 million on an annual basis compared to 2008, the net leverage is down to $4.4 billion. So we have significantly de-levered this business, and we now have a very conservatively financed company in my judgment. I think we will wait and see how our split-off transpires before we make any decisions about how liquidity is utilized and what we want to do. But I agree that there's a lot of liquidity and a lot of strength in the operations and balance sheet at Liberty Interactive. How we'll utilize that, whether it's incremental investments, more debt paydown, more opportunistic debt issuance and retirement or share repurchase, we'll weigh all those possibilities as the split-off and this progresses. On the SIRIUS side, just to review, we can buy our way up to 49 9, just under 50 today. At the end of next month, there's a change in the terms and we can make an offer for all the company's stock. We must make it for all the company's stock and go over 50 in an offer for all. And in March 12, we could bypass the 50. So those are all opportunities that exist. We fundamentally like the direction of the business. We fundamentally have confidence in the business, so we're probably not looking to collar our exposure, and I think it's a practical matter despite contract limitations. When you have a 40% stake in a company like that, it'll be very difficult to collar a meaningful percentage of our equity in any case. But we remain optimistic on the direction of SIRIUS, and the options we're looking at largely involve us being supportive of SIRIUS and being believers in SIRIUS, probably not collaring our stake. Operator Your next question will come from Doug Mitchelson with the Deutsche Bank. Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG A couple questions. First, for Greg or Chris. I guess I shouldn't be surprised at the tax NOL you were able to create. But any other potential tax benefits embedded within the company that are not readily apparent to investors? Gregory Maffei Well, I'll just say we are -- obviously have a need to comply with disclosure regulations regarding our tax positions. And so anything that we are obligated to disclose, we do disclose. We, as a company, work to maximize the value, after-tax value, to our shareholders, and much of that involves trying to be thoughtful about our tax-planning positions, but we have obviously disclosed anything that we need to disclose. Chris, do you want to add anything to that? Chris Albrecht No, that's a fair statement. Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG If you look at the benefit that was created, is that something where you're going to get a refund on the 2010 tax filing? Maybe should we expect cash come in the door for that soon. Or is this add-on to an NOL balance that carries forward as other events take place? Gregory Maffei I think it's more the latter, Doug. Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG And then on the Starz side, for the other Chris, you said you had an opportunity to look at the Netflix deal these next few months, I think was quote. Netflix indicated the current deal expires in the middle of first quarter 2012. Do you think the discussions you're having with Netflix have enough momentum for an early renewal to take place? Chris Albrecht I can't really comment on the timing of the discussions. Just to reiterate what we've said and what Rita [ph] said, the deal expires first quarter 2012, and it's an important deal for us, an important relationship, and we are in constant thought and discussion, although it is complex, and we'll certainly let you guys to be the first to know when we have anything concrete to tell you. Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG Just for final, I'll ask it another way. Are you optimistic they'll embrace the style of deal that you need to do? Gregory Maffei Look, this is Greg. The reality is we think there's a great opportunity to work with Netflix and, potentially, other over-the-top distributors, but it can only be on terms that work for Liberty and for Starz in terms of our existing content relationships and our existing distributor relationships. That's the only way it's going to happen. Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG Fair enough. Operator Moving on, we'll hear from Jason Blair [ph] with Telsey Advisory Group [ph]. Unidentified Analyst How should we think about scenarios for a potential reattribution across your companies if you don't get a favorable ruling on the Delaware hearing? It seems as though the cash at Starz may have something to do with that. And also, can you tell us how the growth of subscribers at Netflix may require Starz to make payments to Disney or Sony and how we should think about the scope and impact of that in 2011 and beyond? Gregory Maffei This is Greg. I'll do the first part. We really haven't spent a lot of time modeling the what-if scenario if we're not successful in Delaware. I think we're optimistic about Delaware or we believe we're correct on the law and the facts and that we're progressing well on the trial. So we really haven't done a lot of modeling and I'd be loathe to speculate on what we would do in the event we're not successful. Unidentified Analyst But the cash on the Starz balance sheet, is that directly related to Delaware? Gregory Maffei I think we've noted that Starz is underleveraged. What we do with that cash is somewhat a separate question unrelated to Delaware in my mind. Now bondholders may see it differently. But from us looking at what we want to do, I think that's an unrelated question and we think there's underleverage at Starz, and we're thinking about the best and most clever ways that they're beneficial to all parties in terms of what to do with that cash. So that's our focus. Not a what-if scenario about the trial. Chris, you want to talk about... Chris Albrecht Yes. With regard to the alpha [ph] deals and Netflix, all I can say is that we are not anticipating any issues with regards to that during our existing agreement. And obviously, our studio contracts are an important factor as we look to the different scenarios that we can put into place not just with Netflix but with any of our -- any of the potential OBD [ph] affiliate partners. Unidentified Analyst So your comment earlier about not expecting your programming expense to increase meaningfully -- I think you said 2011 or you highlighted that it would be on a going forward basis -- that would include any payments to Disney and Sony for sub increases at Netflix. It might also -- and it would imply that, I guess, your rate card was coming down on those deals, which would offset your increasing hours of original programming. Chris Albrecht Well, those are two separate questions. I've answered the first one, is yes, we are not looking at an increase in our programming costs due to the Netflix studio issue. And as we've said before, there are a lot of changes that are going on in the theatrical output world. Studios are making less films. And as some of these deals have been renegotiated or deals have been extended, I should say -- we're always looking at the formula or, as you called it, the rate card for the theatricals. And we do think that those trends are going to allow us room to absorb the increased investment in original programming to a great extent. Gregory Maffei But I think it’s -- we've talked about in the past, to just confirm and agree with Chris, we've got a lot of moving parts. What's the box office? We can see some of that now. What happens with partnerships like turbo [ph] that we've talked about before? What's the rate that we roll out the original programming? It's an uncertain. We have a lot of scripts. We have a lot of pilots. We have a lot of ideas. How fast that rolls out. And then lastly, where are we in some of these other ancillary issues? Things like incremental payments to content partners are weighted on the list in terms of driving that number. Company Speaker Maybe this is our last question since we're past the top of the hour. Operator And your final question will come from Tom Eagan with Collins Stewart. Thomas Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC I guess first question on the deal with the Weinsteins. Could you give us some sense of the incremental revenue from the distribution of those titles? And then on a reported basis, you're going to report 100% of the revenue from Starz Media. And will it also include the full amount of the cash in that? Then I have a quick follow-up. Gregory Maffei With regard to the Weinstein deal, we have a deal to distribute up to 20 titles. We are distributing those. We're not investing in the films and investing in the P&A. So for us, it is a deal that's hard to project right now because this is the first film in the deal, although we're certainly off to a great start. And as we look at Anchor Bay's business, it was really important for us to be able to get some theatricals to distribute along with the historical Anchor Bay business and hopeful increase in Starz's original content. So it's one that we think will be a positive story, given the nature of our relationship and given the investment that the Weinstein Company is going to be making in theatricals and the kinds of theatricals that we think will perform well in the DVD market. We also look to not have traditional ups and downs that you have in a theatrical investment business. So for us, without being able to give you any specifics, we are in a distribution-only relationship with -- and as we said before, we are going to be reporting the Starz Entertainment and the Starz Media businesses together as one number going forward. Thomas Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC So does that mean that you're going to be reporting 100% of the Starz Media revenue and cash flow? Christopher Shean We will be reporting 100% of it. There will be an allocation of net income to the minority interest, this case the Weinstein. Gregory Maffei So there's a minority interest element that's below the line that will be taken out. Thomas Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC And then just, lastly, on any kind of renewal of Time Warner Cable and Netflix. So what levers do you have to try to get Netflix to raise its retail price? Is it possible that you could have one rate for the output deals in terms of what they pay for and then a separate deal for the originals? Gregory Maffei You mean in terms of Netflix having two different deals, one for theatricals and one for originals? Thomas Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC Right. Gregory Maffei Look, at this point, the only thing that I can say is that we are looking at all of the potential scenarios with Netflix and with any of the new entrants in the over-the-top space. We believe it is extremely important for us to maintain the integrity of our brands across the different distribution platforms. I think one of the things that Starz has been successful at is creating different brands. Obviously, we mentioned Starz, Encore and MoviePlex. Is it possible that there are other brands that could be added to that suite of products? I guess it's certainly possible, although at this time, there are no specific plans that we can talk to you about. Company Speaker Well, operator, thank you. I think we're done.

Barton Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC And part of my question there was the visibility into the first quarter. Is this continuing, the sub growth? Chris Albrecht Bill? Bill Myers is there and will have any information. They don't report. I think it's probably too early to have any new information. But if we do, Bill Myers will be the one who has seen whatever emails. William Myers Chris, I agree with you. It's too early at this point in time. I guess the one thing I would say is that if you would look at the Starz growth over the last 12 months, it's about 50-50 between a fixed-rate deal and what we're seeing in consignment because we're having continued strong growth with our telco [telecommunications] partners. And if you look at Encore, it's probably more like 65% is really on the consignment side as we're starting to see some of our consignment affiliates really use the Encore products as it is a terrific product. But it's too early for us to tell what's going on in the first quarter. Gregory Maffei So Barton, to summarize, we've got -- I think, original programming has helped. The structure of our contracts had driven some of the sub growth, but there is true organic, real sub growth as well. Operator From BTIG, we'll hear from Richard Greenfield. Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC I just wanted to follow up on Barton's question, then I have one other. There's been fear over the past year that Comcast and some of your other distributors were upset or didn't like the fact that Starz's content appeared on Netflix. But with Starz and Encore subs growing so nicely, is that investor concern simply misplaced? And then, two, you've got -- including marketable securities, I think we tally around $1.3 billion, actually, of net cash and securities on your balance sheet now for Starz. Given the sub growth, the EBITDA growth, when should we expect you to make a decision on using some of that cash either to return to shareholders or simply to do something with it versus just sitting there? Gregory Maffei So on the first point I think we -- this is Greg -- we discussed in the past that the entrant of over-the-top competitors, Netflix being the most visible, has caused friction with our existing distributors the way that new entrants often do, and it's incumbent upon us to try and work with the existing distributors and the new entrants. I give credit to the Starz team for having improved the general tone of those relationships and set the right direction that we want to be a good partner, because it's in our interest to be a good partner. Most of our product is on consignment, and we need those cable partners, those telco partners, those satellite partners to drive our business and make both of us money. So we're very conscious of that. We're working through that and I think you're seeing some of the good results. Does that mean that all the friction is gone? No. But it's something that we're trying to manage and be thoughtful about. I'll let Chris comment and add anything on that, and then I'll come back and talk about the cash. Chris Albrecht Yes. I mean, we realize that the original Netflix deal was controversial. Certainly, it has attracted a lot of attention. As it’s been widely reported, we're having an opportunity to look at that deal going forward in these next months. And we maintain that what we need to work on is a product-price parity for the different Starz, Encore and MoviePlex products. And that's the focus that we have. I don't think that our numbers show anything other than “this is a strong category; these are strong brands” and we look to improve performance and growth in all of these sectors. Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC But there's nothing that seems to show that Netflix is hurting Starz, is there, from a subscriber standpoint. Gregory Maffei Our belief is that the vast majority of the people who are subscribing to Starz and subscribing to Netflix are not in competition. It’s either additive or it's a different segment. Now we're not trying to tell the cable guys or the telcos or the satellite guys we know their business better than they do. But that's our perception. Whatever we think, though, is not as important as what our partners think, and we need to work with them to make sure that we're minimizing as much as possible the natural channel conflict that exists. And that's our goal. And I think we've had some success with that. Not perfect but some good success in 2010 and hopefully more in 2011. Now turning to the cash question. Rich, we're just an inherently very conservative company. We don't like leverage much, and we're just hoarding that cash for the day when who-knows-what happens. Now I think we've said before, that was firmly tongue-in-cheek, that we are thoughtful enough what opportunities exist in the marketplace. We're thoughtful about where the business is. And we're going to make a decision, as when we're ready, about what to do with the liquidity at Liberty Starz. And we are mindful of the fact that we have quite a lot of liquidity there, as I noted. No dates today, sorry. Operator Your next question will come from Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc. First of all, Q’s [QVC] really in a unique position relative to the other cable networks, more or less world-turned-upside-down and over-the-top since you're actually paying your cable and satellite partners a percentage of your sales. Is there any benefit over time from all that media distribution conduits you're getting as far as that goes? And can you just talk about it in a broad context? And then also, you said that new customer activity at Q [QVC] was up about 18% on a global basis, which is a pretty resounding number. I mean, is it really just a halo you're getting from all the new apps that are out there? Or what specifically is driving that because that's pretty nice step function improvement? Gregory Maffei Mike, do you want to handle that? Michael George Yes. On the first question about over-the-top and new forms of distribution and whether that benefits Q [QVC], I think over time it does. Clearly, our traditional cable and satellite and now telco partners are critical to us, and we continued to have very good relationships with them. And to your point, it's certainly financially attractive relationships for them as well. But as we add more and more nodes of distribution, I think it just gives us more flexibility to kind of go to wherever the customer is. So we don't -- the nice thing about our model is we don't have a stake in the spite in terms of what form of distribution wins. We just want to be wherever the distribution is. And some forms of distribution are more directed at the customers and therefore less costly for us. But our goal is to be on every relevant platform and wherever the customer is looking for video. And as long as we can sell the product through that platform, we benefit. And certainly, the growth of -- the rapid growth, from a standing start, of platforms like tablets, which are a more attractive viewing option for longer sales -- I think all of that will really benefit us over time. So we think we're in kind of a sweet spot as it relates to this transformation of the distribution environment. In terms of what drove the 18% growth in new customers, we are now on about a, probably a six-, eight-quarter run of really healthy new-customer growth. And I think it continues to be a combination of factors. Part of it is just what products and categories we're offering where, as we to move and more leading brands in categories like consumer electronics and beauty, those or well-known personalities in the fashion arena. Those brands and personalities bring customers with them. A recognizable brand in electronics or a recognizable personality with a big fan following. Those things matter to us, and it's very powerful when some of the personalities we've added to the channel can reach out to their fan base through Twitter and Facebook and expose more people to QVC. So it's the mix of products. It's more new-name, friendly products. It's the power of brands and personalities to drive traffic. And it also points to, I think, a better job that the team is doing with online marketing. Our online marketing team has really risen to the challenge of trying to find creative and ROI-attractive ways. We've always been conservative in online marketing because the ROIs haven't been great. But I will say we're getting better at that and seeing better results. Finally, I would just point to sort of a general increase in the brand halo, positive PR around the brand. I think the brand is just more credible. And some of that historic stigma associated with our format, I think in the last couple of years we've really seen that diminish quite rapidly with the things we've done to elevate our product offerings. So long answer to say I think all of those factors ultimately contribute to the expanded reach. Operator That will come from James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital. James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital Two on Starz, if I could. First of all on Starz Media, it looks like it actually generated positive EBITDA in the quarter, and I'm wondering if that's a trend that we'll see going forward. Is this now a profitable entity? Or is there some onetime stuff going on there, because that certainly hasn't been the pattern in the past? And secondly, Chris, if you could talk about -- for original content, I know you've got an array of the deals on the table that you're working on. But broadly, what sort of rights do you see as you need to have versus ones that you would take on such as DVD and the like, should it make sense? But other than U.S. pay TV rights, are there others that you absolutely need to have in any sort of cooperative deal? Chris Albrecht With regards to the first one, we spent a lot of time and effort this year rationalizing the Starz Media businesses. We've decided to get out of the Overture theatrical film business. And we looked at Anchor Bay as a real strategic asset that, if reattributed to Starz -- we could have that as a growing business, even though, as I said before, maybe the overall sector in the hard goods side isn't necessarily growing. We look at that as a positive growth business for our company. So I would think that with the Weinstein deal, with the growth of originals, certainly the good performance of Spartacus, which we hope to continue, that Starz Media should be a positive story for us for the foreseeable future. Gregory Maffei No, I totally agree with Chris on the direction. We re-architect-ed that business and, I give credit to the Starz team for doing that. Q4 was somewhat of a positive anomaly just because of the timing of events of how expenses were recognized in 2010 and how revenue came in, in Q4. So I don't think you should necessarily extrapolate Q4 as all the good for the future. I agree entirely that we re-architect-ed the business, and I give credit to the Starz management team for that. Chris Albrecht With regards to the right that we're looking to retain, certainly U.S. pay-TV rights are imperative. But as a follow-along to what we just talked about, certainly retaining at least the North American DVD rights seems to be a good strategy for us. Those were rights that we think that we can monetize on their own, but also go to help continue to strengthen the overall Anchor Bay business, which, as I said, is not just a strategic asset for us but one that we hope will be a positive story. And Anchor Bay also supplies the Starz Channels with many films through the Anchor Bay Films division, which go to help us to meet our quotients (sic) for theatrical films with our cable and satellite and telco affiliates. Operator From Morgan Stanley, we'll hear from David Gober. David Gober - Morgan Stanley A couple for Greg, if I could. On the LINTA side, you noted the strong liquidity and cash flow that you guys have at that business. And I was just wondering how you think about the optimal leverage, longer-term, given the cost of capital these days. And also, any sense of when you would consider starting to buy back stuff again, and any blackout periods you might have if you do get -- assuming that you go forward with the spend of LCAPA and Liberty Starz? And then on the SIRIUS side, as the first -- the second anniversary of that deal, I was just wondering if you can kind of walk us through what changes in your flexibility there, and any sense if it would make sense to potentially collar a portion of that stake or take up the overall size of that position. Gregory Maffei First on the LINTA point. LINTA had, like many businesses, a challenging financial picture on the liquidity side right after the Lehman bankruptcy. And at that time, our net leverage in LINTA was $9.6 billion. Today, while EBITDA is up something like $100 million on an annual basis compared to 2008, the net leverage is down to $4.4 billion. So we have significantly de-levered this business, and we now have a very conservatively financed company in my judgment. I think we will wait and see how our split-off transpires before we make any decisions about how liquidity is utilized and what we want to do. But I agree that there's a lot of liquidity and a lot of strength in the operations and balance sheet at Liberty Interactive. How we'll utilize that, whether it's incremental investments, more debt paydown, more opportunistic debt issuance and retirement or share repurchase, we'll weigh all those possibilities as the split-off and this progresses. On the SIRIUS side, just to review, we can buy our way up to 49 9, just under 50 today. At the end of next month, there's a change in the terms and we can make an offer for all the company's stock. We must make it for all the company's stock and go over 50 in an offer for all. And in March 12, we could bypass the 50. So those are all opportunities that exist. We fundamentally like the direction of the business. We fundamentally have confidence in the business, so we're probably not looking to collar our exposure, and I think it's a practical matter despite contract limitations. When you have a 40% stake in a company like that, it'll be very difficult to collar a meaningful percentage of our equity in any case. But we remain optimistic on the direction of SIRIUS, and the options we're looking at largely involve us being supportive of SIRIUS and being believers in SIRIUS, probably not collaring our stake. Operator Your next question will come from Doug Mitchelson with the Deutsche Bank. Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG A couple questions. First, for Greg or Chris. I guess I shouldn't be surprised at the tax NOL you were able to create. But any other potential tax benefits embedded within the company that are not readily apparent to investors? Gregory Maffei Well, I'll just say we are -- obviously have a need to comply with disclosure regulations regarding our tax positions. And so anything that we are obligated to disclose, we do disclose. We, as a company, work to maximize the value, after-tax value, to our shareholders, and much of that involves trying to be thoughtful about our tax-planning positions, but we have obviously disclosed anything that we need to disclose. Chris, do you want to add anything to that? Chris Albrecht No, that's a fair statement. Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG If you look at the benefit that was created, is that something where you're going to get a refund on the 2010 tax filing? Maybe should we expect cash come in the door for that soon. Or is this add-on to an NOL balance that carries forward as other events take place? Gregory Maffei I think it's more the latter, Doug. Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG And then on the Starz side, for the other Chris, you said you had an opportunity to look at the Netflix deal these next few months, I think was quote. Netflix indicated the current deal expires in the middle of first quarter 2012. Do you think the discussions you're having with Netflix have enough momentum for an early renewal to take place? Chris Albrecht I can't really comment on the timing of the discussions. Just to reiterate what we've said and what Rita [ph] said, the deal expires first quarter 2012, and it's an important deal for us, an important relationship, and we are in constant thought and discussion, although it is complex, and we'll certainly let you guys to be the first to know when we have anything concrete to tell you. Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG Just for final, I'll ask it another way. Are you optimistic they'll embrace the style of deal that you need to do? Gregory Maffei Look, this is Greg. The reality is we think there's a great opportunity to work with Netflix and, potentially, other over-the-top distributors, but it can only be on terms that work for Liberty and for Starz in terms of our existing content relationships and our existing distributor relationships. That's the only way it's going to happen. Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG Fair enough. Operator Moving on, we'll hear from Jason Blair [ph] with Telsey Advisory Group [ph]. Unidentified Analyst How should we think about scenarios for a potential reattribution across your companies if you don't get a favorable ruling on the Delaware hearing? It seems as though the cash at Starz may have something to do with that. And also, can you tell us how the growth of subscribers at Netflix may require Starz to make payments to Disney or Sony and how we should think about the scope and impact of that in 2011 and beyond? Gregory Maffei This is Greg. I'll do the first part. We really haven't spent a lot of time modeling the what-if scenario if we're not successful in Delaware. I think we're optimistic about Delaware or we believe we're correct on the law and the facts and that we're progressing well on the trial. So we really haven't done a lot of modeling and I'd be loathe to speculate on what we would do in the event we're not successful. Unidentified Analyst But the cash on the Starz balance sheet, is that directly related to Delaware? Gregory Maffei I think we've noted that Starz is underleveraged. What we do with that cash is somewhat a separate question unrelated to Delaware in my mind. Now bondholders may see it differently. But from us looking at what we want to do, I think that's an unrelated question and we think there's underleverage at Starz, and we're thinking about the best and most clever ways that they're beneficial to all parties in terms of what to do with that cash. So that's our focus. Not a what-if scenario about the trial. Chris, you want to talk about... Chris Albrecht Yes. With regard to the alpha [ph] deals and Netflix, all I can say is that we are not anticipating any issues with regards to that during our existing agreement. And obviously, our studio contracts are an important factor as we look to the different scenarios that we can put into place not just with Netflix but with any of our -- any of the potential OBD [ph] affiliate partners. Unidentified Analyst So your comment earlier about not expecting your programming expense to increase meaningfully -- I think you said 2011 or you highlighted that it would be on a going forward basis -- that would include any payments to Disney and Sony for sub increases at Netflix. It might also -- and it would imply that, I guess, your rate card was coming down on those deals, which would offset your increasing hours of original programming. Chris Albrecht Well, those are two separate questions. I've answered the first one, is yes, we are not looking at an increase in our programming costs due to the Netflix studio issue. And as we've said before, there are a lot of changes that are going on in the theatrical output world. Studios are making less films. And as some of these deals have been renegotiated or deals have been extended, I should say -- we're always looking at the formula or, as you called it, the rate card for the theatricals. And we do think that those trends are going to allow us room to absorb the increased investment in original programming to a great extent. Gregory Maffei But I think it’s -- we've talked about in the past, to just confirm and agree with Chris, we've got a lot of moving parts. What's the box office? We can see some of that now. What happens with partnerships like turbo [ph] that we've talked about before? What's the rate that we roll out the original programming? It's an uncertain. We have a lot of scripts. We have a lot of pilots. We have a lot of ideas. How fast that rolls out. And then lastly, where are we in some of these other ancillary issues? Things like incremental payments to content partners are weighted on the list in terms of driving that number. Company Speaker Maybe this is our last question since we're past the top of the hour. Operator And your final question will come from Tom Eagan with Collins Stewart. Thomas Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC I guess first question on the deal with the Weinsteins. Could you give us some sense of the incremental revenue from the distribution of those titles? And then on a reported basis, you're going to report 100% of the revenue from Starz Media. And will it also include the full amount of the cash in that? Then I have a quick follow-up. Gregory Maffei With regard to the Weinstein deal, we have a deal to distribute up to 20 titles. We are distributing those. We're not investing in the films and investing in the P&A. So for us, it is a deal that's hard to project right now because this is the first film in the deal, although we're certainly off to a great start. And as we look at Anchor Bay's business, it was really important for us to be able to get some theatricals to distribute along with the historical Anchor Bay business and hopeful increase in Starz's original content. So it's one that we think will be a positive story, given the nature of our relationship and given the investment that the Weinstein Company is going to be making in theatricals and the kinds of theatricals that we think will perform well in the DVD market. We also look to not have traditional ups and downs that you have in a theatrical investment business. So for us, without being able to give you any specifics, we are in a distribution-only relationship with -- and as we said before, we are going to be reporting the Starz Entertainment and the Starz Media businesses together as one number going forward. Thomas Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC So does that mean that you're going to be reporting 100% of the Starz Media revenue and cash flow? Christopher Shean We will be reporting 100% of it. There will be an allocation of net income to the minority interest, this case the Weinstein. Gregory Maffei So there's a minority interest element that's below the line that will be taken out. Thomas Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC And then just, lastly, on any kind of renewal of Time Warner Cable and Netflix. So what levers do you have to try to get Netflix to raise its retail price? Is it possible that you could have one rate for the output deals in terms of what they pay for and then a separate deal for the originals? Gregory Maffei You mean in terms of Netflix having two different deals, one for theatricals and one for originals? Thomas Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC Right. Gregory Maffei Look, at this point, the only thing that I can say is that we are looking at all of the potential scenarios with Netflix and with any of the new entrants in the over-the-top space. We believe it is extremely important for us to maintain the integrity of our brands across the different distribution platforms. I think one of the things that Starz has been successful at is creating different brands. Obviously, we mentioned Starz, Encore and MoviePlex. Is it possible that there are other brands that could be added to that suite of products? I guess it's certainly possible, although at this time, there are no specific plans that we can talk to you about. Company Speaker Well, operator, thank you. I think we're done. Thank you all for joining us this morning or afternoon depending on your time zone, and thank you for interest in Liberty Media.

(Operator Instructions) I’d like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Robert Williams Thanks [Kristen]. With me today are Chairman and CEO, Michael Dell and CFO, Brian Gladden. Brian will review our second quarter results then Michael will follow with his perspective. When we get to Q&A please limit your questions to one with one follow up. Our Investor Relations activities for the balance of this year include the Citigroup Technology Conference in New York in early September. We have a group investor meeting with Michael and Brian and one of them later in the month and two events in December including the CSFB Technology Conference and the Raymond James IT Supply Chain Conference. I’d like to remind you that all growth comparisons made on this call are year-over-year unless otherwise stated and that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from these projected in the forward-looking statements because of the number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement contained in our press release and on our website. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.  I’d now like to turn it over to Brian. Brian T. Gladden Thanks, Rob. We’re generally pleased with the results of our second quarter. We believe that they demonstrate continued strong execution and broad progress on key initiatives we’ve shared over the last few quarters. Specifically, our cost reduction programs have never been more crucial than during this weaker demand environment. Our results are driven by accelerating COGS improvements including better manufacturing efficiencies, continued OpEx controls and disciplined commercial execution. We also should highlight very strong working capital results for the quarter. Michael will talk about relatively solid aggregate first half performance and I’d just like to reiterate that we’re still in a very tough environment with weak demand continuing, and we have a lot of work to do to continue to transform the company. So let’s get right into the P&L and key performance metrics that you’ll find on Pages 6 and 7 of the posted web deck. Revenue was down 22% to $12.8 billion on unit shipments that were down 14%. Sequentially, revenue was up 3% versus the first quarter with unit shipments up 10%. This sequential improvement is consistent with our view that our demand environment has stabilized and while still mixed globally and by segment, it is improving somewhat. Gross margins were 18.7%. Solid progress on our COGS initiatives, disciplined pricing particularly in July and a buy-out of a revenue sharing agreement with a vendor and growth in enterprise products more than offset the pressure we saw from component costs, dependent pricing and client mix dynamics. The vendor transaction was worth about 50 basis points in the rate.  Much of the COGS progress was related to manufacturing and logistics actions associated with our $4 billion cost savings initiative. I’ll cover these items in more detail in a moment. OpEx was down 14% and was 13.5% of revenue. Organizational effectiveness expense or OE was $87 million or $0.04 after tax, with the majority of this expense related to OpEx. Excluding the impact of $73 million in costs related to OE in Q2, adjusted OpEx was down $347 million or 17% year-over-year.  Intangibles amortization was $40 million and primarily affected our COGS. Expense related to our broader performance based long term compensation plan, which is primarily equity, was $92 million, split roughly 15% in COGS and 85% in OpEx. Financing and other income was negative $42 million, driven in part by lower investment yields and higher interest expense related to the $1.5 billion in debt issuances we’ve done this year. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 25% and overall GAAP earnings per share were $0.24.  We had a strong cash quarter. Referring to Slide 8 and 9 in the web deck, we generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations. Our cash conversion cycle improved 7 days sequentially to a negative 35 days. As we’ve said, we continue to see opportunities to sustain and even improve our cash conversion cycle. For the quarter receivables increased 8 days as a result of an increased mix of public and consumer retail related to back-to-school, though the quality of our receivables in the quarter and aging improved. Payables increased 84 days, driven by structural improvements in our supply chain and our transition to contract manufacturing. We continue to believe that over time we can generate cash flow from operations in excess of net income, and that we can operate our cash conversion cycle at negative 30 days or better. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10, we ended the quarter with $12.7 billion in cash and investments and after improvements in the capital markets in June we issued $1 billion in three and 10 year notes. We’ll continue to monitor the overall capital and financial markets for any future cash needs. Referring to Slide 11, we’re pleased with our progress in Dell Financial Services. As you know we’ve been actively working this business over the past several quarters to reduce risk, improve returns and diversify our exposure, and we’re seeing the results of those efforts in the results of DFS. During the quarter we saw improvements in managed portfolio delinquency and loss rates, but we remain cautious. Additionally, we continue to take actions that will further reduce our business exposure to specific partners in Q3. Our cost out initiatives played a critical role in our second quarter financial performance. Specifically, let me share with you some of the key details of our COGS initiatives. We continue to make progress in our product redesign cost reduction programs, which you can see on Slide 12. Although we’re pleased with these results, the good news is that we still have significant work and opportunity in this area. In Supply Chain 2.0 our goal is to optimize our global supply chain to effectively serve our different customers around the world. Earlier this year we shifted to a segmented supply chain strategy that provides different ways of fulfilling customers orders and creating differentiated value aligned to their specific needs. We’ll continue to balance our configured order supply chain capabilities with significant utilization of contract manufacturing. Approximately 40% of our volume is now going to contract manufacturing as of the end of the second quarter, and this will continue to grow. As mentioned earlier, our efforts in optimizing manufacturing and logistics contributed to the sequential uplift in gross margins during the quarter, as we held on to these benefits as opposed to passing them through to the customer base. As I’ve said before these realized savings may not be linear and we may choose to reinvest some or all these benefits in the business. Our business units had mixed results in the quarter and some are seeing better market conditions than others. The business unit results can be found on Pages 13 through 16 of the web deck.  Large enterprise had a revenue decline of 32% and 3% decline sequentially to $3.3 billion.  Operating income as a percentage of revenue was down 20 basis points to 5.2%, driven by global demand weakness and aggressive pricing activities on the demand we do see in the market right now. Despite this we continue to invest in our enterprise product, service and sales capabilities to help customers drive down the total cost of ownership, and we’re well positioned to benefit from a return to more normal demand in this segment. Public was the best performing commercial business this quarter, with revenue down 16% and up 20% sequentially to $3.8 billion. Seasonal growth in our education segment was a key contributor to the improvement. Operating profit dollars were up 16%, while operating income percent was up 280 basis points as we exercised pricing and OpEx discipline. We remain focused on tailoring vertical solutions for our unique customer base in public and balancing our geographic expansion by leveraging best practices.  Our small and medium business revenue was down 29% and 5% sequentially to $2.8 billion in the quarter, with IT demand strongest in Asia and weaker in EMEA, where it appears that much of the industry demand was at the lower end of the product portfolio.  Operating income percent was up 40 basis points as we managed to improve gross margins despite the weak demand. Our efforts in SMB are still centered on delivering high value offerings and expanding our relationships through increase coverage. Our consumer business posted a 17% year-over-year increase in unit volume, had revenue of $2.9 billion, up 2% sequentially and 9% decline from last year. Operating income was $89 million including a $53 million benefit from the vendor transaction we talked about. Similar transactions could occur periodically and as we work to expand sources of revenue and margins in this business we will see this variability in margins. This is similar to the dynamics we saw last year in the third quarter, when we had other vendor transactions in the quarter. I want to reiterate that our operating margin outlook for consumer, we continue to believe that the 1 to 2% is the right range to think about for this business in the current fiscal year. A few weeks ago we showed a mobile device prototype at an event in China. We are working with China Mobile and this effort is consistent with our plans to explore opportunities in small screen devices, as we’ve discussed. Just to make sure you have the appropriate context, our primary focus and our investment priorities remain focused on enterprise and solutions. On a regional basis, America’s revenue was down 19%, EMEA was down 33% and APJ was down 21%. Our total revenue from BRIC countries was down 17% and made up about 10% of our total global revenue. In the BRIC, Brazil and China were better on a sequential basis while declines in Russia were the most pronounced year-over-year. Revenue outside the U.S. was 45% of our total mix in the quarter. Moving briefly to product highlights, in the client space mobility units were down 1% and revenue was down 21%, due to the soft demand in commercial segments and average selling price declines in consumer and SMB. Desktop units were down 23% with revenue declining 33%.  For enterprise products and services, our server revenue was down 19% on a 23% decline in units, while sequentially revenue and units were up 9 and 12% respectively. Our worldwide X86 server share was up both year-over-year and sequentially by 60 and 200 basis points respectively, as we remain in the number two position worldwide and number one in the U.S. Storage revenue was down 20%. Our EqualLogic revenue was up 42% with continued strength in margin performance. During the quarter we launched our new PS4000 virtualized Storage Array with performance and capacity for branch office and smaller SAN deployments. Enhanced services revenue declined 11% to $1.2 billion, while our deferred revenue balance grew 2% to $5.8 billion in the quarter. Although we continue to move towards more standalone services, a significant portion of our portfolio is made up of support services, which tend to correlate with hardware unit growth causing the year-over-year decline. Software and peripherals revenue declined 15% in the quarter, driven by overall client unit declines as well as softness in displays and imaging.  Turning to the outlook, much of what we said at the July analysts meeting continues to hold true. From a priority standpoint, we’ll prioritize those initiatives and opportunities that drive a balance of liquidity, profitability and growth. We have a strong bias towards delivering cash returns. By disciplined execution on working capital and our ongoing cost initiatives, we’ll continue to fuel our results here. The second quarter saw better demand sequentially, particularly in the U.S. and parts of Asia where we are seeing some signs of stabilization, albeit lower levels of demand. We do believe it’s too early to say we’ve hit an inflection point, particularly given our mix of commercial accounts in large enterprise and SMB, where we continue to see significant year-over-year demand declines. For our third quarter we expect to see some seasonal demand improvements from our federal government and consumer businesses, but it’s also important to note that the first part of the third quarter is generally a period of slower demand for our large commercial customers in the U.S. and Europe.  From a trending standpoint we do expect overall revenue for the second half of the fiscal year to be stronger than the first half, assuming that the current demand trends continue. We believe that a refresh cycle in commercial accounts will be a calendar 2010 story. We remain confident that the significant majority of commercial customers are deferring purchases and will accelerate IT spending to take advantage of technology driven productivity improvements. This acceleration remains predicated on an improving economy and related improvements in customer profits and government tax receipts. While pleased with our gross margin performance and the ability to offset component and pricing pressures we saw in the second quarter, we continue to see headwinds in component costs, where we have line of sight to see increases in panels and memory in the current quarter. Finally, we also expect to continue to absorb organizational effectiveness expenses this year as we continue to realign our business and improve our competitiveness. With that, I’ll turn it over to Michael. Michael S. Dell Thank you, Brian. We’re pleased with our progress in an uneven demand environment globally. We also want to reiterate our commitment to optimizing operating income and cash flow growth over time. The first half of this year saw our revenues down 23%, but up sequentially in the second quarter with order rates improving in July and that’s extended into August, that particular strength in our enterprise products and services, with our EqualLogic storage and our 11G server platform.  Excluding $272 million in OE expense, we delivered first half EPS of $0.52. Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion and we built a solid cash position. Our results demonstrate the power of separating our commercial businesses. Our public business for example had strong sequential growth in almost every product group and customer vertical.  Now, when we look ahead, we see a pretty powerful new product cycle. When you think about the new Halo Processor family from Intel, Windows 7 to replace effectively in many customers Windows XP which is soon to be an eight-year-old operating system, Office 2010 which comes in the first half of next year which we think is a very significant addition to the client portfolio and tremendous progress in both client and server virtualization, all of these add up to what we see is a powerful new product cycle going into calendar 2010. And from our EqualLogic offering to our 11G racks and blades to our data center solutions, we are well positioned to integrate and deliver the best value for enterprise customers. As we explained in July at our analysts meeting, the large majority of the current and future data center and server and storage opportunities are going to be based on simpler, more open solutions, the very kind that Dell can provide. With our position, our installed base, our tremendous access to customers of all sizes and our growing capabilities, this is where we’re focused, where we’re winning and where we expect to continue to win. Continued progress on our $4 billion cost reduction program and progress on expanding our business across the globe and ongoing investments in enterprise products and solutions, taken together, we believe we can deliver solid operating income and cash flow to growth over time.  So now let me open it up for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital. Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital Wanted to ask what happened since the analyst’s day on gross margins? It sounded like they were going to be in the mid-17s and excluding the gain around 18.2, so 70 basis points or so of better than expected progress towards the end of the quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk about what happened and the sustainability of things that surprised you there. Brian T. Gladden Yes, Ben, you know first thing I’d say is you know we’re committed to transparency. We at the time saw pretty clear pressure after about eight weeks into the quarter. We talked about component costs. We talked about what we were seeing in pricing. We had already at that point when we talked to you initiated actions to try and offset that. We said that during the meeting, and I would just say we’re pleased with the execution of the teams. We worked with tightened pricing. We accelerated some of our COGS actions. We managed discretionary costs. We worked through managing the mix. You know I think those are some nice accomplishments to get gross margins back where they should be. You know going forward I would just say as I said in the comments that we still see some challenges around component costs and I think pricing is going to continue to be challenging, and you know we’re working hard to offset those and improve profitability. I think as we’ve said we’ve managed gross margins within a range. There are clearly some things that we’re going to do over time to try and get gross margins up, as we invest in the enterprise and the solutions that Michael talked about. That may cause us to invest in OpEx and you know change the dynamics a bit, but for the short term we’re focused on trying to maintain gross margins. Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital So to be clear, was accelerating your cost savings and managing the mix at the end of the quarter and was there anything in services or were those the main things? And anything in any particular geo? Brian T. Gladden You know if you look inside the business what you saw was real strength in the enterprise portfolio and the high margin elements of it. And that was a significant contributor to the margins in the quarter. Michael S. Dell Yes, mix in the last month of the quarter was significantly better. Brian T. Gladden And I think what we’re also seeing as we start to win more enterprise business, you know it is typically in the industry more you know last month’s in nature and we certainly saw a fair bit of that in July. Operator Your next question comes from Brian Alexander - Raymond James. Brian Alexander - Raymond James Just in terms of the upgrade cycle comments, I’m just curious why you think PCs will be a huge priority for CIOs next year given we’re coming out of a period where spending on almost any technology has been deferred and there are arguably more important investments for companies to make. And then just following on, how strong do you think that refresh opportunity will be in the commercial sector, specifically what percentage of the PC install base do you think will turn over next year and into 2011 for the industry? Michael S. Dell I think the data center virtualization is going to continue to be a high priority. What I would tell you is that when you look at the age of the install base, we know that after a certain period of time the cost just becomes pretty onerous and the percentage of these machines out there that are based on Windows XP, which again is an eight-year-old operating system in another month or two, you know also what many of you may not have done and I would encourage you to do is go to dell.com, buy a modern PC, put Windows 7 on it, put Office 2010 on it, you will love your PC again. And as more and more people do that, I’m here to tell you there’s going to be a refresh cycle next year. It’s not all going to come in the first month or the second month, but over the course of the year there will be a big refresh cycle. Brian Alexander - Raymond James Can you be a little bit more specific, Michael, in terms of what percentage of the install base do you think will get turned over next year versus kind of your normal expectation for a replacement cycle? Michael S. Dell I don’t think we really know. You know we do know that we have a large install base and we have pervasive customer relationships, and certainly we’ve built the product lines to go serve that up. I would also tell you that you know we’re gaining share in servers and storage. And you know building the solution portfolio to win and in the data center. So I wouldn’t focus only on the client comment. Operator Your next question comes from Maynard Um – UBS. Maynard Um – UBS Can you just talk about the process for these PC refreshes in 2010? Because it sounds like it’s going to be a fairly you know so you may get some enterprises kind of refreshing in large orders. Do you anticipate new RFPs that are going to be put out? Have you seen any of those RFPs yet or when do you anticipate those will be there? And just in terms of the competition for those RFPs, should we anticipate that the ASPs and margins might be a little bit lower, given the increase in competition? Michael S. Dell You know what we’ve seen so far is there have been a number of large RFPs, and we’ve actually won quite a few, but they’ve been delayed in deployment because of the kind of state of the economy and budgets. You know we’re certainly expecting as the economy is kind of stabilizing and giving some signs of improvement, that where those wins have occurred will start to go from kind of won to actually being deployed. What the process looks like next year I don’t think we really have any way of knowing at this stage. As Brian said it will depend on kind of larger economic factors. But we do know that after a certain period of time, people will replace their machines and there’s a large install base. The average life has extended and whenever you get an alignment of technology as powerful as this, and an old install base, you know we have every reason to believe that there will be a strong refresh. Maynard Um – UBS If I could just follow up on that, just on these RFPs that you’ve won, is there any sense of what percentage of the install bases within those RFPs are being refreshed or upgraded? Michael S. Dell No. I don’t have any data like that. But you know I could tell you anecdotally that you know we have customers that have you know install bases of four and five year old machines. And you know they’ve planned to deploy new machines and for budget reasons haven’t done it yet. So we’re convinced those will occur, but they’re delayed. Operator Your next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein I wanted to ask you about operating expense. It was down about 17% year-over-year. Revenues were down 22% so I realize it’s difficult to keep cutting OpEx at the rate that revenue is falling. But on a sequential basis it was essentially flat, despite the fact that it seems like you took a lot of organizational effectiveness expense last quarter, I think about $180 million, and another $73 million this quarter. Is that organizational expense not principally workforce reduction? If we work backwards from that math, that would kind of imply 4,500 people have come out over the last two quarters, yet we saw OpEx actually marginally go up when you make the one time adjustment sequentially. So I guess the questions are one, can you explain what this organizational effectiveness charges are? You’ve stated that you expect them to continue and accordingly should we expect operating dollars in the second half to be materially lower than they were in the first half of this fiscal year? Michael S. Dell Do you mean OpEx for the second half, Toni? Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein Correct. Michael S. Dell Yes, you know I would say as you know as we look at these organizational effectiveness activities, they do span both OpEx and COGS. We have made some changes in our manufacturing footprint as part of the transition and incurred some costs there. And that has contributed to our benefits on the COGS line as well. And there were also some facilities related costs that show up in those numbers, so that’s kind of one perspective around OE. I think as you look at OpEx and you look sequentially, you know there are things that we’re investing in. And I think as we talked about the strategy and gain more confidence in our ability to invest in solutions and building out capability organically, we’re doing some of that. I think you’ll see that going forward and as I said we would hope over time that has an impact as well on gross margins, and you’ll see gross margins expand. So we’ll continue to make those trade-offs. There are costs continuing to come out of OpEx, but we are selectively as we see some stabilization in demand we are selectively making some OpEx investments in the business as well. Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein If I could just follow up, for the organizational effectiveness charges that you took in Q1 and Q2, what percentage benefit did you get? So did you get 50% of the benefit from those charges in Q2? Did you get 25? You know I often realize that once you take workforce charges you don’t get any benefits for a little while, so what percentage of the roughly $250 million that you spent on operating organizational effectiveness charges have you received benefits from through the end of Q2? And I don’t think you answered the question on whether you expect OpEx in dollar terms to be lower in the second half or not. Michael S. Dell You know in general we think about these organizational effectiveness programs, I mean we tend to look for in aggregate a one year sort of payback. And when you get into the details of you know where these programs are and you know in some cases when they’re in Europe you have to deal with Workers Councils and you have a bit longer process, your payback isn’t nearly that immediate. So as we look at the second half of the year and some of the actions that we took even in the first part of the year that have involved our European operations, you’ll see some of those benefits kick in then. So I mean it varies. But again in general in aggregate we’re looking for kind of a one year payback on these kinds of programs. And in terms of second half, you know again we’ll continue to see costs coming out of OpEx. The question is you know how much are we going to make organic investments in the business to offset that given our confidence in where we see demand going. So we’ll continue to make those trade-offs. You know it’s hard to say at this point, Toni. Operator Your next question comes from David Bailey - Goldman Sachs. David Bailey - Goldman Sachs  Can you give us a little bit more detail on the improvements that you saw in demand, particularly in July and August, either by product area or geography? Michael S. Dell Well you know U.S. and Asia minus Japan were up sequentially in revenues, you know 11% in Americas and 11% in Asia minus Japan. China was up 9%. The total was 3. BRIC was up 16% so you know emerging and U.S. was quite strong. And you know challenges in EMEA. EMEA down 13%, Japan down 24 although sequentially Japan always has a down second quarter. And as we’ve talked about the mix into some of the enterprise products was very healthy. David Bailey - Goldman Sachs But that was for the full quarter, but you made a comment that July was I think the strongest month of the quarter and that continued into August. Are those areas that continue to be the strength or did you see something different? Michael S. Dell Yes, I think the strong areas continue to be strong. You know U.S. and Asia you know had strong Julys. David Bailey - Goldman Sachs And any comment on back-to-school so far? Michael S. Dell Back-to-school looks pretty good. Operator Your next question comes from Richard Gardner – Citigroup. Richard Gardner – Citigroup I just wanted to follow up on all the discussion regarding the corporate upgrade cycle next year and ask you, Michael and Brian, whether your confidence in a refresh next year is based on actual conversations that you’re having with your customers and you know what you see in terms of RSP activity or whether it’s more based on you know just the aging of the installed base that you see out there. Michael S. Dell Yes, you know when we survey our field teams and talk to you know CIOs out there, this is what we hear. And you know I think it’s not 2010 and it hasn’t started yet. And certainly there are risks here. You know customers may look at Windows 7 and say well maybe I’ll wait or it has a problem or not good enough. Everything we see right now tells us it’s actually quite positive and we also think there’s an overlooked piece of this that most people haven’t paid attention to and that’s Office 2010. And you know for those of you who are into this sort of thing you might go check it out. Richard Gardner – Citigroup And just as a follow up, I was wondering, Michael, if you have a view on what percentage of the installed base is capable of running Windows 7 or Windows Vista at this point, based on your own customer installed base? And also I think historically a lot of large corporates have upgraded their PC and their operating system infrastructure separately and as long as the PCs were good enough for the new OS in many cases they would put the new OS on the existing hardware base. So I’d be interested to get your thoughts on what percentage of the hardware base is ready for Windows 7? Michael S. Dell Well, it’s always a subject of debate in terms of you know do you put the new OS on the old hardware. I think that the difference now is the size of the installed base of old hardware has never been greater. And again you’re talking about you know a change from an eight-year-old operating system, so it’s a significant you know change over in terms of capability and you know we just see a lot of old machines out there that are going to be replaced. Certainly some people will put Windows 7 on the installed base. You know generally the larger customers don’t like to touch a machine once they’ve put it out there. It’s just more expensive for them to just leave it in place and do a rolling upgrade. Brian T. Gladden Hey, Rich, I’d just jump in there to just kind of remind everyone that we’ve always believed that you know the cycle would be predicated on an improvement in the economy and kind of related improvements in customer profits, etc. If you look at you know the commercial accounts, you know probably across the globe, you’ve still got some commercial businesses that are down you know 20 to 30% literally across the globe and that’s just not [audio impairment], that’s across many companies that we look at. And people are pretty convinced that budgets are locked for the back half of this year. That will be a little bit better because they didn’t spend as much in the first half. Yes, so I mean we’re going to continue to remind you guys that we believe this is a 2010 event. We’re excited about it, but this is something that will begin gradually and build through the year and we’ll just have to see how things break in terms of you know the improvements in underlying economic conditions and corporate profitability. Operator Your next question comes from Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley Six weeks ago you sounded more concerned about gross margins dropping with the higher competitive cost environment than you do today. Is it fair to extrapolate that it’s the strength in server and storage sales that you saw in July and that should continue into the next couple of quarters that gives you you know more confidence and less volatility on the gross margin line? Michael S. Dell Well I think we’ve also raised prices and I think we’ve also done some work on COGS. So I think it’s a combination really of all three that are helping to offset that pressure we see. Operator Your next question comes from Bill Shope - Credit Suisse. Bill Shope - Credit Suisse Yes, I have another question as well on gross margins. Just to be clear, outside of the issues you mentioned in the release and so far on this call, were there any noticeable late quarter improvements in the component pricing environment, whether it’s through price breaks on traditional components or through volume incentives from Microsoft or Intel that provided the benefits to margins after the analysts day? Michael S. Dell So, Bill, to clarify, you’re asking if there were vendor based incentives that benefited gross margins? Bill Shope - Credit Suisse Well looking at all the components, right, so traditional components including panels, memory and as well as the prices you pay through Intel and Microsoft, I’m just wondering, I understand the overall basket you know was headed in the wrong direction at the analysts day. I’m wondering if there was any change in that direction at the tail end of the quarter, whether one time in nature or whether something that you’re going to continue to see offset some of the pressure in coming quarters? Michael S. Dell Nothing surprising. I mean we generally have you know a lot of volume based deals where we have rebates that are tied to specific commitments, but I would tell you nothing in the quarter that surprised. One you know deal that we talked about that we called out relative to consumer business would be the only thing that I would call out. Everything else was generally typical. Bill Shope - Credit Suisse And then ex that vendor buyout, would you characterize the current gross margins as within a sustainable range in the near term? Michael S. Dell Yes, I think if you take that buyout out you know it’s probably in the range. Sure. Operator Your next question comes from Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal Brian, I wanted to ask you about the services line item if I could. It was down sequentially. I know it’s highly correlated to units, but units were generally up across the board. What conclusions should we draw about the revenue run rate of services as we look out the next couple quarters? And related to that, is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of mix that would impact services profitability going out the next couple of quarters as well? Brian T. Gladden Well I think you know services revenue at sold we’ve got 11% year-over-year. I think on a sequential basis you know pretty close to what we saw with units. We did. The deferred services balance actually grew in the quarter on a sequential basis. Michael S. Dell To its highest ever level. Brian T. Gladden Yes, $5.8 billion. So I mean obviously that’s something that we look at in terms of upsell, in terms of the tax rates and you know really a good sign in terms of our progress of building the services business. So you know that’s I think encouraging for the future and as we continue to build that deferred services balance, you know that’s obviously a positive for us going forward. In terms of mix that we would expect anything different, I don’t think so. I mean I think we continue to grow you know some of the higher ended enhanced services as well, faster than the core business, and that will help. Those will be higher margin. We feel pretty good about the services progress. Operator Your next question comes from Shannon Cross - Cross Research. Shannon Cross - Cross Research Wanted to talk a little bit about what’s going on in sort of the notebook ASP range. Can you, Michael and Brian, can you talk a little bit about you know the mix shift that you’re seeing to lower ASP notebooks and netbooks? How much of it you sort of attribute to the weak economy versus you know a more permanent shift down in ASPs? And then if you can talk a little bit about how you’re thinking about market share. I know you’re balancing profits versus market share but is there a level of market share that you don’t want to slip below and that you’ll sort of fight to maintain? Michael S. Dell Yes, I think there is with the economic pressure some trading down. You know we also have seen that customers you know will get enticed by the price point or the size of a 10” or 11” platform and then you know decide that the screen is not big enough. They can’t see enough of the things they want to do and they want to go back to a bigger screen. You know we’re going to be disciplined in managing around operating profit and cash flow here. We’re not driving for market share. We’re driving for profit. Shannon Cross - Cross Research But there’s no level that you’re sort of watching? You just sort of take it quarter-by-quarter? Michael S. Dell We’re focused on profit share, we’re not focused on market share. Operator Your next question comes from Bill Fearnley - FTN Equity Capital Markets. Bill Fearnley - FTN Equity Capital Markets Michael and Brian, I wanted to ask you guys what’s the latest on the upsell part of the direct sales model? How is it working versus your expectations and is it a factor in the gross margins performance this quarter? Do you have any additional color on the attach of additional PC features, service attach, S&P attach would be helpful in the upsell model. Michael S. Dell Well services attach has had a lot of success. And you see that in the deferred services balance. You know generally attach rates have been good on other items and we continue to build out the portfolio of other things. You know our pro support type attach rate has kind of gone from the low 30s to the mid-30s, and actually a little north of the mid-30s. And we built some you know industry leading features now into the pro support offering, particularly for the enterprise products, and that seems to be resonating. You know we were up kind of mid double-digits on blades this quarter which seems to be pretty different from the industry. Bill Fearnley - FTN Equity Capital Markets And what about add-ons though to the PCs themselves, you know how are you seeing the customer take on upgrades for memory, upgrades to hard disk drive size, you know better graphics? How are you seeing that upsell of those components versus historically? Is it more cash-and-carry or how’s the upsell working for the components themselves on the custom built PCs? Michael S. Dell I haven’t really seen any big changes there. You know on the enterprise side the memory footprints have expanded considerably as virtualization has become a bigger part of the demand. Brian T. Gladden And in our S&P business for the quarter actually performed better than the overall hardware business. Operator Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan. Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan I have a question and then a follow up. Just trying to understand more about the sustainability within the public sector, could you give us a little more color, Brian or Michael, about the drivers there? Is this including China and the stimulus activity over there? Was this just U.S. federal government? And then also was the government piece a big driver of the DSO spike at the end of the quarter? Michael S. Dell You know it’s typical in the second quarter. We generally have a pretty strong, seasonal, education driven sector, you know strong growth in the quarter. We enjoyed that quite a bit. That came as expected. I think it’s important to understand and you know that put us in the context of an opportunity. We’re still pretty focused you know in terms of the majority of our business is very much domestic U.S. business, so it’s a real opportunity for us to continue to expand that model and do that globally. Most of it was driven by the U.S. and I would say that again education. It’s typically driven, you know education in Q2 and then the federal budget timeframe forces a strong demand in the third quarter. And then it drops off in the fourth. So I think in terms of sustainability we would expect pretty strong third quarter and then fourth quarter decline. Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan This is the follow up. You did a nice job in terms of expanding your retail outlet footprint in terms of going to 40,000 versus 30,000 in the prior quarter. Can you guys just comment a little on the quality of the sales velocity you’re seeing with these expanded stores? Is it starting to take a little longer before you see kind of a same store sale improvement? Michael S. Dell It’s pretty good. I think we’re in a little over 43,000 you know retail locations, you know up a little over 22% from the first quarter. And you know we’re seeing good traction inside those retail outlets. Brian T. Gladden And I think for the first time we’re getting to the point where internally we’re measuring same-store sales with these partners. We actually went through the process over the last quarter of changing out some of the poorer performers there for the first time. So I think we’ve got a robust process to make sure we’re getting you know what we need from each of these outlets. Michael S. Dell Picking up particularly strong in China. Operator Your next question comes from David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC. David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Can you give us some feel for the percentage of your notebook sales that are currently netbooks? And also what your plans are to introduce CULV machines? Michael S. Dell In terms of netbooks, we’ll have to check on that for you, David. You know the penetration in the commercial accounts which is the majority of our business is really you know almost non-existent. It’s in the teens in consumer so then you kind of say well what is that overall? Well the teens of you know 25% of your units is a small number. Brian T. Gladden It would be less than 5%. Michael S. Dell So it’s a small number. Brian T. Gladden Yes, again we’re focused on profit share not unit share. If we wanted unit share we’d go sell a whole bunch of netbooks but we wouldn’t have the operating income we have. David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC And CULV? Do you plan to roll out CULV machines in the second half of this year? Michael S. Dell We’ve already introduced our first CULV. In fact we were first to market with the Inspiron 11z. Go check it out. Operator Your next question comes from Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Michael, a question on client virtualization you mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks. Maybe if you could talk about your expectations around timing of PC virtualization and then the likely financial impact. Michael S. Dell Well you know we’ve had a great practice around server virtualization and some activity around client virtualization has started. I think it got a little bit slowed down with the economic issues and you know there are certain kind of applications and environments where client virtualization works really well, but it’s not every customer and every environment. You know the offerings are coming together and I think in line with this refresh and all the new technology elements that there’ll be some good opportunities there. But I wouldn’t view client virtualization as pervasive yet as the idea of server virtualization. Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. And is it less attractive from a financial standpoint, even if it’s just more tactical? Michael S. Dell Well I mean of course the way we’ve structured this is we intend to earn more when we virtualize the client than when we don’t virtualize the client. And of course that’s all about offering the whole solution for us. The solution stack kind of starts with the storage and server and then goes to the devices. The device is the least important part of the profit picture. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities. Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities I had one more gross margin question. First can you confirm that you expect gross margins to be about flat sequentially, in the low 18s? And what’s the component price assumption to get you there in terms of specific components? Can you provide some color? Brian T. Gladden   Yes, I’m not going to give you any specific guidance around gross margin rates. I think what I said is we’ve been pretty effective even over a period of multiple years at managing within a range. And I think you can look at that range and you know we’ll be within that. I think that’s what we would say.  The dynamics we see around component pricing, I think you know we’ve called out LCDs and memory as the key problem areas. I think everything else would be more around typical sort of deflationary trends. So you know we expect as I said to see continued pressure on those two key components in the third quarter and probably get a little bit better into the fourth. Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities A follow up question on the storage business, EqualLogic continues to go quite nicely. That implies the EMC business is declining materially. Can you comment on the health of that relationship and the health of that product line? Michael S. Dell Well look, you know the Dell EMC partnership is still an important part of our business and we continue to build and work that relationship. You know the EqualLogic platform is a big one for us. Certainly we’re attracted by having our own IP and the profit that that brings. But these products are somewhat different. You know when a customer is a fiber channel customer, we tend to focus them on the EMC platform. And you know obviously EqualLogic is ISCSI platform today. We’re investing further to extend that into broader areas. But you know I think you can expect to see you know Dell EMC continue for quite some time. And you know we’re working with them on how we create the kind of products that we need, that fit with our enterprise offering, because they’ve got a solid position. We’ve built a great alliance together. Operator Your next question comes from Richard Kugele - Needham & Company. Richard Kugele - Needham & Company Since you brought up your mobile solution in China, I just wanted to follow up on that. You know in particular what it is that you see is attractive to that market, what can Dell bring to the table? And you know if it winds up being solely an Asian solution for you or if you think you can broaden it to other regions. And then within that context obviously your Cupertino competitor is talking about a tablet again. That market has never really taken off. It’s always been a relatively small percentage of total units. And so if you have any perspective on whether you think the tablet market is worth materially chasing or not. Michael S. Dell You know the way I think about this is that first of all you know our primary focus is on the enterprise and the server and storage and solutions area that we’ve talked about. Within our consumer business we have a carrier-centric strategy where we work with the major carriers around the world and you’ve probably seen you know commercials and relationships with companies like AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, China Mobile, etc. And you know within that carrier strategy you know we’ll go and build products that those great carrier partners want to see and the prototype demonstration that was referred to earlier is one of those products. Richard Kugele - Needham & Company Any thoughts on the tablet in that sense? Michael S. Dell No thanks. Operator Your last question comes from Robert Cihra - Caris and Company. Robert Cihra - Caris and Company Just had a question on your consumer margins, I guess if you ex out items it looks like consumer operating margin was still just over 1%, which was better. Are you still targeting sort of a 1 to 2% operating margin in consumer and sort of more specifically if you or if I let’s say assume that your consumer direct is certainly over that, what does that really mean for your retail margins that are now are in kind of as a target? I mean is that something you’re almost targeting as just over breakeven or is it that retail can be 2% and consumer direct maybe even more than that? Brian T. Gladden   I think Rob it depends on the timeframe. As we talk about the consumer business this year, you know we think given the investments we’re making in growing the business and gaining share yes 1 to 2% is what we’ve talked about. That’s pretty consistent with the messaging we’ve had all year. Over time, as we, you know, not only grow that direct business which is a very profitable business for us, but improving the margins in the retail business we think it can be better than 1 to 2% and you know significantly better than that. So we’ve got a plan. We’re working through that plan and I think we’re on track towards the kind of profitability we would expect with that business. Operator We’ll now turn the call over to Rob Williams for closing remarks. Robert Williams Thanks a lot. I hope you’ve heard this afternoon that we continue to work on the core business in what is still a pretty challenging demand environment, particularly as we roll through the back half of the year with challenged commercial businesses around the globe. But at the same time there’s a big focus on our enterprise products and solutions portfolio and we believe that that will help us drive our operating income and cash flow growth over the long term. And so thanks for joining us and we look forward to talking to you again soon. Operator This concludes today’s conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital. Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital Wanted to ask what happened since the analyst’s day on gross margins? It sounded like they were going to be in the mid-17s and excluding the gain around 18.2, so 70 basis points or so of better than expected progress towards the end of the quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk about what happened and the sustainability of things that surprised you there. Brian T. Gladden Yes, Ben, you know first thing I’d say is you know we’re committed to transparency. We at the time saw pretty clear pressure after about eight weeks into the quarter. We talked about component costs. We talked about what we were seeing in pricing. We had already at that point when we talked to you initiated actions to try and offset that. We said that during the meeting, and I would just say we’re pleased with the execution of the teams. We worked with tightened pricing. We accelerated some of our COGS actions. We managed discretionary costs. We worked through managing the mix. You know I think those are some nice accomplishments to get gross margins back where they should be. You know going forward I would just say as I said in the comments that we still see some challenges around component costs and I think pricing is going to continue to be challenging, and you know we’re working hard to offset those and improve profitability. I think as we’ve said we’ve managed gross margins within a range. There are clearly some things that we’re going to do over time to try and get gross margins up, as we invest in the enterprise and the solutions that Michael talked about. That may cause us to invest in OpEx and you know change the dynamics a bit, but for the short term we’re focused on trying to maintain gross margins. Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital So to be clear, was accelerating your cost savings and managing the mix at the end of the quarter and was there anything in services or were those the main things? And anything in any particular geo? Brian T. Gladden You know if you look inside the business what you saw was real strength in the enterprise portfolio and the high margin elements of it. And that was a significant contributor to the margins in the quarter. Michael S. Dell Yes, mix in the last month of the quarter was significantly better. Brian T. Gladden And I think what we’re also seeing as we start to win more enterprise business, you know it is typically in the industry more you know last month’s in nature and we certainly saw a fair bit of that in July. Operator Your next question comes from Brian Alexander - Raymond James. Brian Alexander - Raymond James Just in terms of the upgrade cycle comments, I’m just curious why you think PCs will be a huge priority for CIOs next year given we’re coming out of a period where spending on almost any technology has been deferred and there are arguably more important investments for companies to make. And then just following on, how strong do you think that refresh opportunity will be in the commercial sector, specifically what percentage of the PC install base do you think will turn over next year and into 2011 for the industry? Michael S. Dell I think the data center virtualization is going to continue to be a high priority. What I would tell you is that when you look at the age of the install base, we know that after a certain period of time the cost just becomes pretty onerous and the percentage of these machines out there that are based on Windows XP, which again is an eight-year-old operating system in another month or two, you know also what many of you may not have done and I would encourage you to do is go to dell.com, buy a modern PC, put Windows 7 on it, put Office 2010 on it, you will love your PC again. And as more and more people do that, I’m here to tell you there’s going to be a refresh cycle next year. It’s not all going to come in the first month or the second month, but over the course of the year there will be a big refresh cycle. Brian Alexander - Raymond James Can you be a little bit more specific, Michael, in terms of what percentage of the install base do you think will get turned over next year versus kind of your normal expectation for a replacement cycle? Michael S. Dell I don’t think we really know. You know we do know that we have a large install base and we have pervasive customer relationships, and certainly we’ve built the product lines to go serve that up. I would also tell you that you know we’re gaining share in servers and storage. And you know building the solution portfolio to win and in the data center. So I wouldn’t focus only on the client comment. Operator Your next question comes from Maynard Um – UBS. Maynard Um – UBS Can you just talk about the process for these PC refreshes in 2010? Because it sounds like it’s going to be a fairly you know so you may get some enterprises kind of refreshing in large orders. Do you anticipate new RFPs that are going to be put out? Have you seen any of those RFPs yet or when do you anticipate those will be there? And just in terms of the competition for those RFPs, should we anticipate that the ASPs and margins might be a little bit lower, given the increase in competition? Michael S. Dell You know what we’ve seen so far is there have been a number of large RFPs, and we’ve actually won quite a few, but they’ve been delayed in deployment because of the kind of state of the economy and budgets. You know we’re certainly expecting as the economy is kind of stabilizing and giving some signs of improvement, that where those wins have occurred will start to go from kind of won to actually being deployed. What the process looks like next year I don’t think we really have any way of knowing at this stage. As Brian said it will depend on kind of larger economic factors. But we do know that after a certain period of time, people will replace their machines and there’s a large install base. The average life has extended and whenever you get an alignment of technology as powerful as this, and an old install base, you know we have every reason to believe that there will be a strong refresh. Maynard Um – UBS If I could just follow up on that, just on these RFPs that you’ve won, is there any sense of what percentage of the install bases within those RFPs are being refreshed or upgraded? Michael S. Dell No. I don’t have any data like that. But you know I could tell you anecdotally that you know we have customers that have you know install bases of four and five year old machines. And you know they’ve planned to deploy new machines and for budget reasons haven’t done it yet. So we’re convinced those will occur, but they’re delayed. Operator Your next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein I wanted to ask you about operating expense. It was down about 17% year-over-year. Revenues were down 22% so I realize it’s difficult to keep cutting OpEx at the rate that revenue is falling. But on a sequential basis it was essentially flat, despite the fact that it seems like you took a lot of organizational effectiveness expense last quarter, I think about $180 million, and another $73 million this quarter. Is that organizational expense not principally workforce reduction? If we work backwards from that math, that would kind of imply 4,500 people have come out over the last two quarters, yet we saw OpEx actually marginally go up when you make the one time adjustment sequentially. So I guess the questions are one, can you explain what this organizational effectiveness charges are? You’ve stated that you expect them to continue and accordingly should we expect operating dollars in the second half to be materially lower than they were in the first half of this fiscal year? Michael S. Dell Do you mean OpEx for the second half, Toni? Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein Correct. Michael S. Dell Yes, you know I would say as you know as we look at these organizational effectiveness activities, they do span both OpEx and COGS. We have made some changes in our manufacturing footprint as part of the transition and incurred some costs there. And that has contributed to our benefits on the COGS line as well. And there were also some facilities related costs that show up in those numbers, so that’s kind of one perspective around OE. I think as you look at OpEx and you look sequentially, you know there are things that we’re investing in. And I think as we talked about the strategy and gain more confidence in our ability to invest in solutions and building out capability organically, we’re doing some of that. I think you’ll see that going forward and as I said we would hope over time that has an impact as well on gross margins, and you’ll see gross margins expand. So we’ll continue to make those trade-offs. There are costs continuing to come out of OpEx, but we are selectively as we see some stabilization in demand we are selectively making some OpEx investments in the business as well. Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein If I could just follow up, for the organizational effectiveness charges that you took in Q1 and Q2, what percentage benefit did you get? So did you get 50% of the benefit from those charges in Q2? Did you get 25? You know I often realize that once you take workforce charges you don’t get any benefits for a little while, so what percentage of the roughly $250 million that you spent on operating organizational effectiveness charges have you received benefits from through the end of Q2? And I don’t think you answered the question on whether you expect OpEx in dollar terms to be lower in the second half or not. Michael S. Dell You know in general we think about these organizational effectiveness programs, I mean we tend to look for in aggregate a one year sort of payback. And when you get into the details of you know where these programs are and you know in some cases when they’re in Europe you have to deal with Workers Councils and you have a bit longer process, your payback isn’t nearly that immediate. So as we look at the second half of the year and some of the actions that we took even in the first part of the year that have involved our European operations, you’ll see some of those benefits kick in then. So I mean it varies. But again in general in aggregate we’re looking for kind of a one year payback on these kinds of programs. And in terms of second half, you know again we’ll continue to see costs coming out of OpEx. The question is you know how much are we going to make organic investments in the business to offset that given our confidence in where we see demand going. So we’ll continue to make those trade-offs. You know it’s hard to say at this point, Toni. Operator Your next question comes from David Bailey - Goldman Sachs. David Bailey - Goldman Sachs  Can you give us a little bit more detail on the improvements that you saw in demand, particularly in July and August, either by product area or geography? Michael S. Dell Well you know U.S. and Asia minus Japan were up sequentially in revenues, you know 11% in Americas and 11% in Asia minus Japan. China was up 9%. The total was 3. BRIC was up 16% so you know emerging and U.S. was quite strong. And you know challenges in EMEA. EMEA down 13%, Japan down 24 although sequentially Japan always has a down second quarter. And as we’ve talked about the mix into some of the enterprise products was very healthy. David Bailey - Goldman Sachs But that was for the full quarter, but you made a comment that July was I think the strongest month of the quarter and that continued into August. Are those areas that continue to be the strength or did you see something different? Michael S. Dell Yes, I think the strong areas continue to be strong. You know U.S. and Asia you know had strong Julys. David Bailey - Goldman Sachs And any comment on back-to-school so far? Michael S. Dell Back-to-school looks pretty good. Operator Your next question comes from Richard Gardner – Citigroup. Richard Gardner – Citigroup I just wanted to follow up on all the discussion regarding the corporate upgrade cycle next year and ask you, Michael and Brian, whether your confidence in a refresh next year is based on actual conversations that you’re having with your customers and you know what you see in terms of RSP activity or whether it’s more based on you know just the aging of the installed base that you see out there. Michael S. Dell Yes, you know when we survey our field teams and talk to you know CIOs out there, this is what we hear. And you know I think it’s not 2010 and it hasn’t started yet. And certainly there are risks here. You know customers may look at Windows 7 and say well maybe I’ll wait or it has a problem or not good enough. Everything we see right now tells us it’s actually quite positive and we also think there’s an overlooked piece of this that most people haven’t paid attention to and that’s Office 2010. And you know for those of you who are into this sort of thing you might go check it out. Richard Gardner – Citigroup And just as a follow up, I was wondering, Michael, if you have a view on what percentage of the installed base is capable of running Windows 7 or Windows Vista at this point, based on your own customer installed base? And also I think historically a lot of large corporates have upgraded their PC and their operating system infrastructure separately and as long as the PCs were good enough for the new OS in many cases they would put the new OS on the existing hardware base. So I’d be interested to get your thoughts on what percentage of the hardware base is ready for Windows 7? Michael S. Dell Well, it’s always a subject of debate in terms of you know do you put the new OS on the old hardware. I think that the difference now is the size of the installed base of old hardware has never been greater. And again you’re talking about you know a change from an eight-year-old operating system, so it’s a significant you know change over in terms of capability and you know we just see a lot of old machines out there that are going to be replaced. Certainly some people will put Windows 7 on the installed base. You know generally the larger customers don’t like to touch a machine once they’ve put it out there. It’s just more expensive for them to just leave it in place and do a rolling upgrade. Brian T. Gladden Hey, Rich, I’d just jump in there to just kind of remind everyone that we’ve always believed that you know the cycle would be predicated on an improvement in the economy and kind of related improvements in customer profits, etc. If you look at you know the commercial accounts, you know probably across the globe, you’ve still got some commercial businesses that are down you know 20 to 30% literally across the globe and that’s just not [audio impairment], that’s across many companies that we look at. And people are pretty convinced that budgets are locked for the back half of this year. That will be a little bit better because they didn’t spend as much in the first half. Yes, so I mean we’re going to continue to remind you guys that we believe this is a 2010 event. We’re excited about it, but this is something that will begin gradually and build through the year and we’ll just have to see how things break in terms of you know the improvements in underlying economic conditions and corporate profitability. Operator Your next question comes from Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley Six weeks ago you sounded more concerned about gross margins dropping with the higher competitive cost environment than you do today. Is it fair to extrapolate that it’s the strength in server and storage sales that you saw in July and that should continue into the next couple of quarters that gives you you know more confidence and less volatility on the gross margin line? Michael S. Dell Well I think we’ve also raised prices and I think we’ve also done some work on COGS. So I think it’s a combination really of all three that are helping to offset that pressure we see. Operator Your next question comes from Bill Shope - Credit Suisse. Bill Shope - Credit Suisse Yes, I have another question as well on gross margins. Just to be clear, outside of the issues you mentioned in the release and so far on this call, were there any noticeable late quarter improvements in the component pricing environment, whether it’s through price breaks on traditional components or through volume incentives from Microsoft or Intel that provided the benefits to margins after the analysts day? Michael S. Dell So, Bill, to clarify, you’re asking if there were vendor based incentives that benefited gross margins? Bill Shope - Credit Suisse Well looking at all the components, right, so traditional components including panels, memory and as well as the prices you pay through Intel and Microsoft, I’m just wondering, I understand the overall basket you know was headed in the wrong direction at the analysts day. I’m wondering if there was any change in that direction at the tail end of the quarter, whether one time in nature or whether something that you’re going to continue to see offset some of the pressure in coming quarters? Michael S. Dell Nothing surprising. I mean we generally have you know a lot of volume based deals where we have rebates that are tied to specific commitments, but I would tell you nothing in the quarter that surprised. One you know deal that we talked about that we called out relative to consumer business would be the only thing that I would call out. Everything else was generally typical. Bill Shope - Credit Suisse And then ex that vendor buyout, would you characterize the current gross margins as within a sustainable range in the near term? Michael S. Dell Yes, I think if you take that buyout out you know it’s probably in the range. Sure. Operator Your next question comes from Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal Brian, I wanted to ask you about the services line item if I could. It was down sequentially. I know it’s highly correlated to units, but units were generally up across the board. What conclusions should we draw about the revenue run rate of services as we look out the next couple quarters? And related to that, is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of mix that would impact services profitability going out the next couple of quarters as well? Brian T. Gladden Well I think you know services revenue at sold we’ve got 11% year-over-year. I think on a sequential basis you know pretty close to what we saw with units. We did. The deferred services balance actually grew in the quarter on a sequential basis. Michael S. Dell To its highest ever level. Brian T. Gladden Yes, $5.8 billion. So I mean obviously that’s something that we look at in terms of upsell, in terms of the tax rates and you know really a good sign in terms of our progress of building the services business. So you know that’s I think encouraging for the future and as we continue to build that deferred services balance, you know that’s obviously a positive for us going forward. In terms of mix that we would expect anything different, I don’t think so. I mean I think we continue to grow you know some of the higher ended enhanced services as well, faster than the core business, and that will help. Those will be higher margin. We feel pretty good about the services progress. Operator Your next question comes from Shannon Cross - Cross Research. Shannon Cross - Cross Research Wanted to talk a little bit about what’s going on in sort of the notebook ASP range. Can you, Michael and Brian, can you talk a little bit about you know the mix shift that you’re seeing to lower ASP notebooks and netbooks? How much of it you sort of attribute to the weak economy versus you know a more permanent shift down in ASPs? And then if you can talk a little bit about how you’re thinking about market share. I know you’re balancing profits versus market share but is there a level of market share that you don’t want to slip below and that you’ll sort of fight to maintain? Michael S. Dell Yes, I think there is with the economic pressure some trading down. You know we also have seen that customers you know will get enticed by the price point or the size of a 10” or 11” platform and then you know decide that the screen is not big enough. They can’t see enough of the things they want to do and they want to go back to a bigger screen. You know we’re going to be disciplined in managing around operating profit and cash flow here. We’re not driving for market share. We’re driving for profit. Shannon Cross - Cross Research But there’s no level that you’re sort of watching? You just sort of take it quarter-by-quarter? Michael S. Dell We’re focused on profit share, we’re not focused on market share. Operator Your next question comes from Bill Fearnley - FTN Equity Capital Markets. Bill Fearnley - FTN Equity Capital Markets Michael and Brian, I wanted to ask you guys what’s the latest on the upsell part of the direct sales model? How is it working versus your expectations and is it a factor in the gross margins performance this quarter? Do you have any additional color on the attach of additional PC features, service attach, S&P attach would be helpful in the upsell model. Michael S. Dell Well services attach has had a lot of success. And you see that in the deferred services balance. You know generally attach rates have been good on other items and we continue to build out the portfolio of other things. You know our pro support type attach rate has kind of gone from the low 30s to the mid-30s, and actually a little north of the mid-30s. And we built some you know industry leading features now into the pro support offering, particularly for the enterprise products, and that seems to be resonating. You know we were up kind of mid double-digits on blades this quarter which seems to be pretty different from the industry. Bill Fearnley - FTN Equity Capital Markets And what about add-ons though to the PCs themselves, you know how are you seeing the customer take on upgrades for memory, upgrades to hard disk drive size, you know better graphics? How are you seeing that upsell of those components versus historically? Is it more cash-and-carry or how’s the upsell working for the components themselves on the custom built PCs? Michael S. Dell I haven’t really seen any big changes there. You know on the enterprise side the memory footprints have expanded considerably as virtualization has become a bigger part of the demand. Brian T. Gladden And in our S&P business for the quarter actually performed better than the overall hardware business. Operator Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan. Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan I have a question and then a follow up. Just trying to understand more about the sustainability within the public sector, could you give us a little more color, Brian or Michael, about the drivers there? Is this including China and the stimulus activity over there? Was this just U.S. federal government? And then also was the government piece a big driver of the DSO spike at the end of the quarter? Michael S. Dell You know it’s typical in the second quarter. We generally have a pretty strong, seasonal, education driven sector, you know strong growth in the quarter. We enjoyed that quite a bit. That came as expected. I think it’s important to understand and you know that put us in the context of an opportunity. We’re still pretty focused you know in terms of the majority of our business is very much domestic U.S. business, so it’s a real opportunity for us to continue to expand that model and do that globally. Most of it was driven by the U.S. and I would say that again education. It’s typically driven, you know education in Q2 and then the federal budget timeframe forces a strong demand in the third quarter. And then it drops off in the fourth. So I think in terms of sustainability we would expect pretty strong third quarter and then fourth quarter decline. Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan This is the follow up. You did a nice job in terms of expanding your retail outlet footprint in terms of going to 40,000 versus 30,000 in the prior quarter. Can you guys just comment a little on the quality of the sales velocity you’re seeing with these expanded stores? Is it starting to take a little longer before you see kind of a same store sale improvement? Michael S. Dell It’s pretty good. I think we’re in a little over 43,000 you know retail locations, you know up a little over 22% from the first quarter. And you know we’re seeing good traction inside those retail outlets. Brian T. Gladden And I think for the first time we’re getting to the point where internally we’re measuring same-store sales with these partners. We actually went through the process over the last quarter of changing out some of the poorer performers there for the first time. So I think we’ve got a robust process to make sure we’re getting you know what we need from each of these outlets. Michael S. Dell Picking up particularly strong in China. Operator Your next question comes from David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC. David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Can you give us some feel for the percentage of your notebook sales that are currently netbooks? And also what your plans are to introduce CULV machines? Michael S. Dell In terms of netbooks, we’ll have to check on that for you, David. You know the penetration in the commercial accounts which is the majority of our business is really you know almost non-existent. It’s in the teens in consumer so then you kind of say well what is that overall? Well the teens of you know 25% of your units is a small number. Brian T. Gladden It would be less than 5%. Michael S. Dell So it’s a small number. Brian T. Gladden Yes, again we’re focused on profit share not unit share. If we wanted unit share we’d go sell a whole bunch of netbooks but we wouldn’t have the operating income we have. David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC And CULV? Do you plan to roll out CULV machines in the second half of this year? Michael S. Dell We’ve already introduced our first CULV. In fact we were first to market with the Inspiron 11z. Go check it out. Operator Your next question comes from Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Michael, a question on client virtualization you mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks. Maybe if you could talk about your expectations around timing of PC virtualization and then the likely financial impact. Michael S. Dell Well you know we’ve had a great practice around server virtualization and some activity around client virtualization has started. I think it got a little bit slowed down with the economic issues and you know there are certain kind of applications and environments where client virtualization works really well, but it’s not every customer and every environment. You know the offerings are coming together and I think in line with this refresh and all the new technology elements that there’ll be some good opportunities there. But I wouldn’t view client virtualization as pervasive yet as the idea of server virtualization. Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. And is it less attractive from a financial standpoint, even if it’s just more tactical? Michael S. Dell Well I mean of course the way we’ve structured this is we intend to earn more when we virtualize the client than when we don’t virtualize the client. And of course that’s all about offering the whole solution for us. The solution stack kind of starts with the storage and server and then goes to the devices. The device is the least important part of the profit picture. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities. Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities I had one more gross margin question. First can you confirm that you expect gross margins to be about flat sequentially, in the low 18s? And what’s the component price assumption to get you there in terms of specific components? Can you provide some color? Brian T. Gladden   Yes, I’m not going to give you any specific guidance around gross margin rates. I think what I said is we’ve been pretty effective even over a period of multiple years at managing within a range. And I think you can look at that range and you know we’ll be within that. I think that’s what we would say.  The dynamics we see around component pricing, I think you know we’ve called out LCDs and memory as the key problem areas. I think everything else would be more around typical sort of deflationary trends. So you know we expect as I said to see continued pressure on those two key components in the third quarter and probably get a little bit better into the fourth. Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities A follow up question on the storage business, EqualLogic continues to go quite nicely. That implies the EMC business is declining materially. Can you comment on the health of that relationship and the health of that product line? Michael S. Dell Well look, you know the Dell EMC partnership is still an important part of our business and we continue to build and work that relationship. You know the EqualLogic platform is a big one for us. Certainly we’re attracted by having our own IP and the profit that that brings. But these products are somewhat different. You know when a customer is a fiber channel customer, we tend to focus them on the EMC platform. And you know obviously EqualLogic is ISCSI platform today. We’re investing further to extend that into broader areas. But you know I think you can expect to see you know Dell EMC continue for quite some time. And you know we’re working with them on how we create the kind of products that we need, that fit with our enterprise offering, because they’ve got a solid position. We’ve built a great alliance together. Operator Your next question comes from Richard Kugele - Needham & Company. Richard Kugele - Needham & Company Since you brought up your mobile solution in China, I just wanted to follow up on that. You know in particular what it is that you see is attractive to that market, what can Dell bring to the table? And you know if it winds up being solely an Asian solution for you or if you think you can broaden it to other regions. And then within that context obviously your Cupertino competitor is talking about a tablet again. That market has never really taken off. It’s always been a relatively small percentage of total units. And so if you have any perspective on whether you think the tablet market is worth materially chasing or not. Michael S. Dell You know the way I think about this is that first of all you know our primary focus is on the enterprise and the server and storage and solutions area that we’ve talked about. Within our consumer business we have a carrier-centric strategy where we work with the major carriers around the world and you’ve probably seen you know commercials and relationships with companies like AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, China Mobile, etc. And you know within that carrier strategy you know we’ll go and build products that those great carrier partners want to see and the prototype demonstration that was referred to earlier is one of those products. Richard Kugele - Needham & Company Any thoughts on the tablet in that sense? Michael S. Dell No thanks. Operator Your last question comes from Robert Cihra - Caris and Company. Robert Cihra - Caris and Company Just had a question on your consumer margins, I guess if you ex out items it looks like consumer operating margin was still just over 1%, which was better. Are you still targeting sort of a 1 to 2% operating margin in consumer and sort of more specifically if you or if I let’s say assume that your consumer direct is certainly over that, what does that really mean for your retail margins that are now are in kind of as a target? I mean is that something you’re almost targeting as just over breakeven or is it that retail can be 2% and consumer direct maybe even more than that? Brian T. Gladden   I think Rob it depends on the timeframe. As we talk about the consumer business this year, you know we think given the investments we’re making in growing the business and gaining share yes 1 to 2% is what we’ve talked about. That’s pretty consistent with the messaging we’ve had all year. Over time, as we, you know, not only grow that direct business which is a very profitable business for us, but improving the margins in the retail business we think it can be better than 1 to 2% and you know significantly better than that. So we’ve got a plan. We’re working through that plan and I think we’re on track towards the kind of profitability we would expect with that business. Operator We’ll now turn the call over to Rob Williams for closing remarks. Robert Williams Thanks a lot. I hope you’ve heard this afternoon that we continue to work on the core business in what is still a pretty challenging demand environment, particularly as we roll through the back half of the year with challenged commercial businesses around the globe. But at the same time there’s a big focus on our enterprise products and solutions portfolio and we believe that that will help us drive our operating income and cash flow growth over the long term. And so thanks for joining us and we look forward to talking to you again soon. Operator This concludes today’s conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

Baird & Co., Inc. Operator Welcome to the Dell Inc. third quarter fiscal year 2010 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Robert Williams Thanks. With me today are Chairman and CEO, Michael Dell and CFO, Brian Gladden. Brian will review our third quarter results then Michael will follow with his perspective. When we get to Q&A please just a reminder to limit your questions to one with one follow up. We posted a web deck on Dell.com and we have also released a [vlog] with Brian so I encourage you to view these as there is additional perspective on the quarter provided in those materials.  Our investor relations activities for the balance of the year include the CS First Boston Conference in the Raymond James IT supply chain conference, both in December; our Perot Integration call which is scheduled for the morning of December 16 th  and the JP Morgan technology and UBS Retail Conferences at CEF.  Next I would like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking that are based on our current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from these projected in the forward-looking statements because of the number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement contained in our press release and on our website. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.  With that I would like to turn it over to Brian. Brian Gladden Thanks, Rob. We are encouraged by our third quarter results especially in our large enterprise and SMB businesses where we saw sequential growth for the first time in seven quarters. This is of particular significance for Dell given our higher mix of commercial business relative to the industry and key competitors and the nature of the consumer-led recovery.  We also made solid progress on our key strategic initiatives this quarter. This including the cost structure of the company through our COGS efforts and continued OpEx control, executing a differentiated enterprise strategy and delivering strong cash flow from operations. Overall, we grew sequentially for the second quarter in a row and we expect the fourth quarter to again be sequentially bigger than the third quarter. We saw improving demand momentum in our large enterprise and small and medium businesses later in the quarter and this appears to be carrying over into our fourth quarter.  With that let’s move to the third quarter P&L and the key performance metrics which you will find on pages six and seven of the posted web deck. Revenue was up 1% sequentially while down 15% year-over-year to $12.9 billion. This year-over-year comparison is improved versus our first half year-over-year performance which was a 23% decline. The commercial business, excluding a seasonally down public business, grew 4% sequentially on improving demand as we said in SMB and large enterprise.  Our third quarter reported revenue was adversely affected by the timing of the Windows 7 launch and our SMB and consumer businesses where we did build more backlog than normal due to the later quarter order dynamics. We expect our backlog to return to more normal levels in the fourth quarter assuming we manage through some of the component shortages which I will discuss in a moment.  The gross margin for the quarter was 17.3%. OpEx was 12.8%. Operating income was 4.5% of revenue and our EPS was $0.17 on a GAAP basis. Organizational effectiveness expense was $123 million or $0.05 after tax in the quarter with a majority of this expense related to COGS. The biggest item driving this expense this quarter was the closure of our Winston Salem, North Carolina manufacturing facility which was announced earlier in the quarter. $59 million of this expense is non-cash which represents the majority of the Winston Salem closure expense.  Intangible amortization was $40 million or $0.01 after tax and primarily [due to] effective COGS. Adjusting for these items, our gross margin was 18.3%. OpEx was 12.5% of revenue and our adjusted operating income was $740 million with a relatively strong rate of 5.8%. Frankly we had some challenges below the operating income line on the P&L. Financing and other expenses were $63 million driven by the higher interest expense related to the $3.8 billion in debt we are now carrying, lower investment yields on our invested cash and the heightened foreign exchange rate volatility which is reflected in mark to market on our currency hedges in F&O.  As we look forward, we expect to incur approximately $50 million per quarter in interest expense going forward and our investments are currently returning about 30 basis points per year in return. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 34.5% which was driven by an increased mix of profits in higher tax jurisdictions and our mix shift to enterprise products and services. Our current view for the full-year tax rate is 28-30% which is the same as our year-to-date rate.  When you adjust earnings per share for the organizational effectiveness expense and intangible amortization we delivered $0.23 per share in the quarter. Expenses related to our broad performance based long-term compensation plan which is primarily equity based were $78 million split roughly 15% in COGS and 85% in OpEx.  We had another strong operating cash quarter. Referring to slides eight and nine in the web deck we generated $801 million in cash flow from operations which is significantly in excess of our net income for the quarter. Year-to-date we have generated $2.6 billion in cash flow from ops and over the past four quarters we have generated $3.4 billion in operating cash flow which is up 42% versus the prior four quarters.  Our cash conversion cycle improved again by one day sequentially to negative 36 days. For the quarter receivables decreased two days and inventory increased one day consistent with the seasonal consumer ramp especially given the Windows 7 timing. Payables remained flat at 84 days as a result of structural supply chain improvements and our ongoing transition to contract manufacturing.  We continue to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income and a task conversion cycle that is negative 30 days or better before the impact of the Perot acquisition.  Turning to the balance sheet on slide 10, we ended the quarter with $14 billion in cash and investments. As a result this balance has already been decreased by $4 billion as of November 3 rd  when we closed the Perot transaction. Moving to slide 11, we are pleased with our progress in Dell Financial Services. This business is a strategic asset for us and generated $900 million in new originations in the quarter. We saw third quarter managed basis losses decline from 8.2% to 7.2% driven by favorable delinquency performance in the first half of the year.  We continue to intensely manage credit and take the necessary actions. With respect to our CIT relationship and their recent bankruptcy filing there has been no impact on DFS and our CIT international operations are continuing to be fully operational and able to fund new business as we move forward.  On the COGS line, we continue to make great progress in our overall $4 billion cost savings efforts and we have accomplished a significant amount of work. We still have more to do. Our product redesign driven cost reductions and progress to the point where 65% of our business client and 75% of our consumer platforms have been cost optimized and re-designed as you can see on slide 12. This program will continue as we cycle through our product portfolio and further reduce the total cost of the bill of material on our key hardware products.  In supply chain 2.0 we are ramping work to optimize our global supply chain in order to effectively serve our different customer fulfillment models. We have improved logistics capabilities in areas such as freight where we have increased the utilization of ocean shipping and are beginning to drive complexity reduction and reducing significant numbers of SKUs with product design simplification activities.  Approximately 43% of our manufacturing volume shipped in the quarter has now gone through contract manufacturing partners. We are also seeing improved cycle times across our new manufacturing footprint. As we mentioned during our second quarter earnings call we did see pressure in the overall component cost environment during the third quarter and we expect a number of components to be similarly challenged in the fourth quarter.  Turning to the business units, we had mixed results in the business units but we did see positive momentum in many places. The business unit results can be found on pages 13-16 of the web deck. Large enterprise had revenue growth of 4% sequentially and was down 23% year-over-year to $3.4 billion in revenue. This business is down from a quarterly peak of $4.9 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and as a result has suffered from de-leveraging on the cost side.  Operating income as a percentage of revenue was down 10 basis points sequentially to 5.1% driven by this lack of scale. We saw sequential growth in server revenue which was up double digits along with increases in mobility and services. We remain confident this segment is well positioned for significantly better operating leverage going forward and we continue to make critical investments in R&D in areas like EqualLogic and our next generation services as we manage costs tightly.  Public had another great quarter with revenue down 3% sequentially and 7% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. Seasonal federal strength in the US was a key contributor to revenue while we saw the typical seasonal decline in our education business. Operating income percent was up 40 basis points year-over-year to 9.5% as we continue to sell higher valued solutions to our customers in the public space.  Like last quarter this was our best performing business on a year-over-year basis. Our small and medium business revenue increased 5% sequentially and was down 19% year-over-year to $3 billion. We saw demand strengthen through the quarter in a number of areas and the third quarter was our first quarter of sequential growth in seven quarters in SMB. Positive trends in the Americas and Asia continued through the quarter while EMEA is challenged but picked up in the very end of the quarter.  Operating income percent improved 80 basis points sequentially to 9.5% of revenue as we improved mix and scaling in SMB. Our efforts remain focused on delivering high value offerings and expanding our relationships through increased coverage. We are especially excited in SMB about our Take Your Own Path campaign which highlights entrepreneurs who use Dell technology and solutions to solve their business problems.  Our consumer business posted a 17% year-over-year increase in unit volume and revenue of $2.8 billion, down 1% sequentially and 10% from a year ago. While profitability in the quarter was sequentially down, operating income for the year is at 1.2% of revenue which is consistent with our full-year target of between 1-2%. Though demand in our direct business moderated during October in anticipation of the Windows 7 operating system launch, we have seen strong momentum since that launch  which has carried over into our current quarter order book.  As you know, Dell and Perot Services were separate companies at the end of the third quarter and we closed the acquisition early in our fourth quarter. I did want to touch on a few items from their third quarter results as you begin to factor these into your models going forward. For the third quarter Perot Systems revenue was $629 million which was down 12% while flat sequentially. Gross margins were 19.4% and operating income was 6.8% of revenue.  As a reminder, approximately 72% of Perot’s quarterly revenue comes from their backlog so you should expect to see a similar result in the fourth quarter as they do typically see some softness in billings in the fourth quarter. Perot also delivered $85 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter. Again, we are pleased to have the Perot team onboard and we will have a lot of additional details to provide on our combined services business and Perot synergy plans update next month on December 16 th .  On a regional basis, sequential revenue declined in the Americas by 2% while EMEA and APJ were up 6% and 7% respectively. We saw signs of momentum in Asia and the Americas while EMEA continued to encounter more challenging economic conditions. Our total revenue from BRIC countries was up 18% sequentially and made up nearly 12% of our total global revenue. In BRIC, China, India and Russia all demonstrated strong sequential growth while Brazil was also positive but more moderate.  Our total revenue outside the US was 47% of our total business. Moving quickly to some product highlights, in the client space mobility units were up 11% sequentially and revenue was up 8% due to increased demand in all segments while year-over-year revenue declined 14%. Average selling prices in mobility declined by 2%. Desktop units were down 10% sequentially with a revenue decline of 9%. On enterprise products and services server revenue was up 10% sequentially while unit increase of 1% while revenue and units were down 6% and 7% respectively on a year-over-year basis.  Our worldwide X86 server share was up year-over-year by 180 basis points while down 90 basis point sequentially as we remain in the number two position worldwide and number one in the US. Storage revenue was down 8% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. EqualLogic revenue was up 31% with continued strength from a margin standpoint. Our overall storage margin rates are up over 30% versus where they were last year.  Enhanced services revenue rose 2% sequentially to $1.2 billion while our deferred revenue balance decreased 2% from Q2 to $5.9 billion. This is also up 6% year-over-year. The dynamics of the service business will change beginning in the fourth quarter as we integrate Perot Systems. Perot we extend the Dell Services Business into hosting, consulting, application development and business process outsourcing and we anticipate expanding our managed and modular services businesses as part of the integration.  Software and peripherals revenue grew 1% sequentially and was down 7% year-over-year. Q3 saw some sequential improvements in revenues in both display and imaging.  Turning to the outlook, our focus remains unchanged since last quarter and our analyst meeting in July. We remain intent on driving improvements in our core business, making strategic investments in our enterprise assets and using liquidity, profitability and growth as our framework to drive long-term value creation. We are seeing improvements in the underlying market demand trends on a sequential basis in a number of areas including a significant portion of our commercial business. These improvements have sustained themselves into the first part of our fourth quarter. We believe we are well positioned to benefit.  For our fourth quarter we expect to see typical demand improvements in our consumer business. While businesses [coupling] are seasonally lower during the quarter. We are confident that revenue in the fourth quarter will be stronger than the third given the demand trends we are seeing today. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate some tightness and component cost pressure particularly from memory and LCDs. You should also consider our higher mix of lower margin consumer revenue in your seasonality assumptions as we look at our fourth quarter.  We continue to see a significant majority of commercial customers that defer purchases. While the average installed base continues to age beyond historical norms, recent technology introductions, indications of improving overall economic activity and the prospect of a lift in associated IT spending position the company well particularly as commercial customers upgrade their IT assets over the next year.  In order to provide more information to shareholders, we have made the decision to provide additional Regulation G disclosure which bridges GAAP and non-GAAP information beginning in our fourth quarter. This will allow us to provide investors with a clear view of items such as acquisition, intangible amortization, acquisition related expenses and organizational effectiveness charges.  With that I will turn it over to Michael for a few comments.  Michael Dell  Thank you Brian. While we are in the midst of a significant transformation in our business we remain biased towards expanding profitability and cash flow generation. Overall, adjusted operating income without organizational effectiveness and amortization of intangibles was 5.8%. Our public and small, medium businesses operated with 9.5% operating income. We believe we have opportunities in large enterprise as the growth returns to that business and as we accelerate our enterprise solutions including services.  Free cash flow year-to-date was $2.9 billion and was $3.9 billion over the last four quarters. We are focused on expanding our recurring revenue and profit streams with a differentiated view of how to win in the enterprise. Storage and server revenues were up 5% sequentially as we continue to bring our customers an expanding portfolio of best value enterprise solutions.  EqualLogic grew 31% year-over-year with a strong pipeline heading into Q4 including demand for our recently launched PS4000 virtualized storage array. We have now added over 10,000 new customers to the EqualLogic platform bringing almost 15,000 customers and we continue to invest in the R&D, solutions and sales resources to expand this platform.  We continue to make progress in the data center. Our data center solutions group achieved record revenue with triple digit growth both sequentially and year-over-year. This brings our total share in the United States for X86 servers to an industry-leading 38% in the most recent quarter. We are also excited to welcome the Perot team and the platform this provides would now combined Dell Services business to $8 billion in annual revenue with $13 billion in combined backlog and deferred services revenue.   Together the expanded Dell Services supports approximately 30 million computer systems and manages over two million seats. In healthcare we have over 2,500 accounts but just 130 overlap. Overall we see significant opportunities to grow horizontally, vertically and by geography. We will discuss this in much more detail in our call next month.  We also expanded two key partnerships in networking with Juniper and Brocade and we remain on track with our cost optimization activities and remain committed to targeted investments in the business to bolster our enterprise capabilities. Our third quarter OpEx was down nearly $200 million versus the third quarter of the prior year and down over $400 million versus the third quarter of 2008.  We also saw very significant progress in costs.  Now let me turn it over to the operator for questions.   Question-and-Answer Session   Operator (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein.  Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein Brian you had mentioned because of Windows 7 you had experienced a larger than usual backlog in this quarter exiting the quarter. Can you help quantify how material that was and how we should be thinking about potentially making an adjustment for revenue that maybe would have recognized this quarter had it been more normal and not had that Windows 7 bump and ostensibly how much benefit you might have starting next quarter because of that?  Brian Gladden  I think as you know, we run the business generally with a pretty minimal backlog. I think what we saw was the order patterns especially in SMB and consumer where order rates were somewhat depressed, probably in the two weeks prior to the launch of Windows 7. So the middle two weeks of October. Once we saw the launch happen the order rates picked up significantly. That contributed to some orders that came in the last couple of weeks that obviously we just couldn’t get out given the timing. I wouldn’t call it material enough to impact how you are thinking about the fourth quarter. Again, we do think it is going to be a sequentially improved fourth quarter just based on the order rates we see.  Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein The follow-up for Michael, you had mentioned two quarters ago you expected a powerful PC replacement cycle. Do you still hold that view and should we be thinking about materially above a normal trend PC unit market growth of 10% for 2010?  Michael Dell  I would not be surprised to see it well into the teens. I think there is an aging installed base for sure. You just have an accumulation of new technologies at the hardware, software, virtualized client and these IT managers really know they cannot extend the life of these client assets forever. While I don’t think it is all going to occur at once, I think it will be a rolling refresh that occurs over perhaps 18 months, I can’t remember a time when a very high percentage of them skipped an entire operating system. So what we remind them, and they know this, Windows XP is eight years old. So yes I think it is going to be a pretty possible cycle.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Bill Shope - Credit Suisse.  Bill Shope - Credit Suisse My question is on the potential corporate upgrade cycle as well. Once this cycle begins potentially sometime next year, I suspect other large OEMs will be jockeying for a share of the pie as well. In that instance will you still focus on gross margin preservation over market share stability or does the strategy change somewhat to a more growth oriented focus?  Michael Dell  We think we are holding or gaining share in the right kind of price points. Our efforts on the cost side should expand our ability to profitably compete in a larger portion of the price points. What I would also tell you is that the pipeline of client opportunities we are already seeing more client activity in the last 30-60 days than we have in a long time and the pipeline for client activity kind of going forward into next year is the strongest it has been in a long time as well. So if I look at our commercial businesses the second quarter was kind of a bottom. The third quarter was certainly better. October was the best and November will be better than October. So the length of the turn is good.  Brian Gladden  I would also say when you think about the share dynamics we have faced as we have seen consumer growing much faster than commercial, remember our business is 80% commercial. So by virtue of that mix we have seen share losses that frankly should reverse themselves when commercial comes back in a refresh cycle. So I think just by nature of our mix you should see our overall share position improve but we will absolutely stay biased towards profit.  Bill Shope - Credit Suisse Can you comment on how you think about cash usage as we enter a recovery? Should we expect to see you possibly resume some share repurchase activity or is your priority still on acquisitions and other investments with the cash?  Brian Gladden  I think we will continue to look at that. I think clearly we have been through a cycle where we wanted to protect the liquidity and make sure we had adequate cash for survival and obviously some strategic activities. We continue to look at that. As we have opportunities in the marketplace for acquisitions that clearly might be part of the strategy and we will continue to revisit opportunities with the share repurchase as well.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Maynard Um – UBS.  Maynard Um - UBS A question first on gross margins please. McAfee talked about accelerated payments to Dell in their September and December quarters. Can you just talk about any benefit from that and maybe one or two accruals in the quarter?  Brian Gladden  We don’t really talk about…those are competitive discussions and actually we would rather not talk about that. So I think what you have is pretty much all we are going to talk about.  Maynard Um - UBS But just from an accounting perspective do vendor payments flow through the COGS line?  Brian Gladden  That depends on the structure of the agreement and how we would arrange that transaction.  Maynard Um - UBS In terms of in the past I guess the street didn’t strip out the amortization of intangibles from pro forma numbers. Given the way you have broken down the pro forma reconciliation should we be excluding those from our pro forma calculations going forward?  Brian Gladden  I think as we said we are going to introduce a Reg G reconciliation next quarter and when we do that we will explain really all the details of that. That will be one element of our reconciliation.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner – Citigroup.  Richard Gardner - Citigroup Just given your comments regarding components I wanted to get a sense number one of how this will affect gross margins in the fourth quarter if we take mix out of the equation? Do you feel like you have a pretty good handle on what component prices are going to do in the fourth quarter and how are you approaching pricing decisions now? I know that in the past pricing decisions have been made by the business divisions and sometimes haven’t necessarily agreed with the corporate view of what component pricing is going to do and if you could also talk about whether component availability will be a significant limiter of upside for you in the fourth quarter if demand continues to come back strongly?  Brian Gladden  I think we do have a pretty good grip on where component pricing is going for the quarter. In many cases have negotiated deals that for us provide some level of protection versus where the market is going. I think we are in a reasonable position in terms of availability of components. I do know the industry will have some shortages but I think we are maybe in an advantage position there given some of the negotiations we have done over the last couple of months. I would also say that I think our pricing process given what we know about components is pretty well integrated and the linkage between our teams in the field and knowing what our component costs are and what our product costs are is pretty good. So given we know where these prices are going we are taking actions right now from a price standpoint to try and protect margins.  Richard Gardner - Citigroup So we should really be thinking about mix as being the primary factor on gross margins then going into the fourth quarter?  Brian Gladden  I think that is right. We are going to be doing everything we can to protect the fundamental profitability and mix will be what mix will be.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital.  Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital I have two questions that I guess weren’t addressed. First, it is obviously all out there in the press and everything on what is going on with Intel and AMB. There is the NYAG report about $1 billion or so of rebates flowing particularly to you and obviously your competitors benefited and then I know you can’t really comment on that but is there any sort of change that has taken place over the last years and even accelerated into the quarter that hurts gross margins given your dealings with that vendor? Is there something artificially that also hurts margins in the quarter or over the last year that we should be thinking about with regard to that particular component? Or is it fully anniversaried and we don’t…how should we be thinking about it because we all are. We all saw the numbers and it is the elephant in the room. That is my first question.  Brian Gladden  We generally don’t comment on these kinds of legal litigation activities. This is a case where we are not even involved in the litigation so it would be difficult to comment in a lot of detail. I would tell you to answer your question around modeling and thinking about the financials, no change in the way we think about how our component costing is related to processors. The issues that have been raised in these various legal proceedings about Dell and other systems manufacturers and the rebates for purchases, I think they miss a very important point and that point is that it is really about the net cost of the components, not the rebate. It is really just the net cost that matters. As you know, we do everything we can to negotiate the lowness of that cost and the best value to our customers. Obviously this is a very competitive industry and it demands that. That is really our perspective on the issue. We are not going to comment any further on it.  Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital I guess if it just changed to lower pricing over time…the other thing I was going to ask you was on the tax rate. It was higher than expected and you said due to mix. You also have a Malaysian facility that had a very favorable tax structure. I was wondering if the mix shift towards more contract manufacturing was also impacting the tax rate and making it higher over the long term as the mix maybe moves away from that Malaysian facility maybe you will pay higher taxes elsewhere. If you could explain that effect on your tax rate that would be great.  Brian Gladden  Without getting into a lot of tax planning dialogue, there is not necessarily differentiated tax rate between contract manufacturers and some of our facilities. A lot of it has to do with where the products are ultimately sold. So it is really a mix of geographic and product line mix changes that drive the tax rate changes.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley.  Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley On Windows 7 there has been a relatively clear expectation that the consumer demand uptick is relatively near-term and the enterprise uptick will come sometime later next year but I find your comments around commercial as interesting in terms of the strength you saw in October. Do you think that SMB will act more like consumers and upgrade in the next couple of quarters or do you think they will act more like enterprises?  Brian Gladden  Well the small ones act more like a consumer and the big ones operate more like enterprise. If you push it together SMB is about 50% of Windows 7 today and we think they tend to go first. I should say the momentum we are seeing in the enterprise customer is around client, has nothing to do with Windows 7 at this point. We are seeing a pipeline of Windows 7 that is starting to build for enterprise customers really next year.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan.  Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan In the enterprise accounts where you are seeing improvements right now can you talk a little bit more about the mix? Are these customers targeting more of your higher end or lower end SKUs? Are they also seeking heavier than usual discounts?  Brian Gladden  It is biased towards the enterprise portfolio so the services, solutions, storage, servers are definitely a lot of virtualization type projects are going on. A lot of mission critical activity going on in those accounts. But we are starting to see more client activity than we have in quite some time. There is definitely a bias in all these accounts towards value and they are looking for builds to bring best value solutions.  Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan In PCs you talked earlier about expecting the consumer to be exhibiting the typical seasonal patterns. I am just curious if there anything on the part of Dell or your PC tiers in terms of a concerted push to try to emphasize notebooks over net books this holiday season in terms of driving the improved mix with respect to ASPs? Is there any type of phenomenon taking place?  Brian Gladden  Well I can tell you from our standpoint as we look at retail opportunities we are prioritizing opportunities where margins are best and we would walk away from deals where margin isn’t so good. Netbooks actually is one of the areas that is most challenged given the pricing dynamics right now. So that would tell you we are trying to prioritize higher end products with better profit.  Michael Dell  You can see in our average selling prices ours are more than twice that of some of our competitors.  Operator The next question comes from the line of David Bailey - Goldman Sachs.  David Bailey - Goldman Sachs The non-EqualLogic storage sales were weak this quarter. What are you doing to reverse this trend and how long do you think it will take?  Michael Dell  There is a shift going on there where we are moving away from non-Dell branded storage offerings. You can think of this as dual margin pass through revenue. So our margin on storage continues to increase and with the additional, better mix of sales also comes service annuities which obviously are valuable over time to us. So we are moving more and more to the portfolio f Dell IP, Dell branded and in some cases co-branded products. That is the direction. That is why you see the shift in the mix and the increased margins.  David Bailey - Goldman Sachs Then you said you are starting to see more client activity in the commercial space. Is that RFPs or are you actually starting to ship some PCs into them and if it is RFPs when do you think it will start to kick in?  Brian Gladden  We are seeing orders and shipments increase pretty substantially in kind of the last 30-60 days in those enterprise customers and the pipeline is also increasing.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal.  Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal OpEx, you have taken several hundred million in charges in the April/July and now the October quarter and if we net out some of the charges it looks like OpEx has been about flattish over the three quarters. Can you give any color on what are the OpEx trends we should be thinking about near-term?  Brian Gladden  I think as you know we took out an awful lot coming into the year and that continued through the first quarter. We have continued to, as you know, incurred some organizational effectiveness charges that further reduced the OpEx but a lot of that has moved to COGS during the course of this year as we have addressed some of the manufacturing footprint. I think what you see is we are making some selective investments as I have mentioned and as Michael has mentioned, whether that is in R&D or around some of our key enterprise products. Some of it is around rebuilding sales force capability in certain markets and solutions capability there. Those are things we will continue to do.  As we see some revenue growth return to the business, we think again I think you also see it mix up phenomenon with our move to enterprise products that ultimately will require more OpEx as we think about the shape of the P&L going forward.  Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal My follow-up relates to that. Large enterprise is the lower operating margin business as compared to public and small/medium business with obviously consumers running at a lower level but as smaller relevant size of the pie. So as large enterprise ramps does that end up putting pressure on the operating margin or do you have some scale there that ramps at the same time? I’m just trying to understand what the mix will do if and when large enterprise ramps.  Brian Gladden  We really think that the large enterprise business will scale. It has been the hardest hit in terms of volume. So when that business comes back we expect it will be slightly or pretty flat and we will see some nice improvement in margin rate there.  Operator The next question comes from the line of  Scott Craig – Bank of America.  Scott Craig – Bank of America When you talk about seasonal for the next quarter, maybe a bit of a clarification there. If I exclude the fiscal fourth quarter of 2009 the last couple of years before that seasonality was sort of low single digits on the revenue side. But if you go back a little farther from there you are talking about off typically 5-10%. So maybe some clarification about what you would think sort of normal seasonal patterns would be obviously excluding any impact from Perot. Then I have a quick follow-up.  Brian Gladden  I think it is really hard to look at history given one of the changes in our portfolio so that our consumer mix is going to be bigger than historical and I think consumer is one of the bigger drivers of the fourth quarter. You also have very, very different dynamics in the marketplace in terms of people coming back to buy and some of the refresh stuff taking off and some of the improvements in demand we haven’t seen. So I think it is very hard to tell based on historical demand what you would expect going into the fourth quarter. We do, as we said, think it is going to be sequentially bigger.  Scott Craig – Bank of America With regard to the larger enterprise business, I know this is just one quarter but it was up quarter-over-quarter from a revenue standpoint but operating margin actually declined a little bit so there didn’t appear to be scale there. Can you maybe talk about the dynamics of what happened there from an operating margin perspective quarter-to-quarter?  Brian Gladden  I think it is hard to pull out one quarter and sort of break that apart. Some of it is mix of the business. Some of it is the timing of services as we get some of the balance sheet and some of that comes off. I don’t have specific details on what the margin change would have been.  Michael Dell  I think there are a couple of things that they are trying to accomplish in this environment. That is to continue to make investments in some of their enterprise solutions. A big piece of the EqualLogic investment and next generation platforms is born by the large enterprise group. As you know they are very focused on making investments in their services portfolio and their enterprise solutions portfolio. So they are really committed to kind of biting the bullet here and committed to those investments that they believe are going to pay off as the growth comes back. I will remind you that business was at a peak at about $5 billion quarterly rate and is down significantly to the current levels. So it is just now starting to come back. What we are seeing is the beginnings of some improvement in demand in these commercial accounts and the first time in a number of quarters we have seen sequential growth. So as that sequential growth gradually comes back and hopefully it builds maybe through the middle of next year and the back half of next year that is when some of the operating margin leverage begins to kick in those businesses.  Brian Gladden  Operating income rates were 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter down so pretty flat with gross margin rates up year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. So I think it will scale if we get some volume back.  Operator The next question comes from the line of  Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities.  Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities I wanted to follow-up on that last point. Do you have a target margin which you think about for the commercial business and the enterprise business? Do you think you can take it back somewhere close to where SMB and public currently run?  Brian Gladden  I would just go back to the long-term framework we have given you around operating margin of 7% plus and when we look at all of the things we are doing around COGS and operating expenses and shifting the portfolio here we think that is a good mock up framework to think about but it will go with that portfolio of businesses.  Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities What is implied in that 7% operating margin target for the enterprise business? What is the key variable that gets you there? Is it bigger volume on the existing structure?  Brian Gladden  I think it will be a combination of mix and scale, improved services and more solutions focus. Michael Dell  I think a lot of the things we are doing on costs will ultimately enable some of that growth to help us get the scaling we need for the improvement in the business.  Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities On the M&A strategy, what are the top two or three priorities from a capability standpoint or a technology standpoint you are interested in?  Michael Dell  We are pleased with the Perot acquisition and believe that is a great platform for us. I would say most of our focus would be on smaller targets than Perot. So you shouldn’t be surprised to see a portfolio of small to midsized acquisitions that we think add capability along the themes that we have talked about in terms of solutions and delivering or bringing best value solutions to our customers.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani – RBC Capital Markets.  Amit Daryanani – RBC Capital Markets  Inventory was up about 14% sequentially and while I was expecting some uptick in sales next quarter but the [inaudible]. I am wondering is that some of the backlog you had exiting the quarter or did you have to build some of the component inventory that you foresee some shortages for?  Brian Gladden  I wouldn’t say there is anything unusual in inventory other than we had a traditional seasonal retail staging that happens in the third quarter. So as you look at being in position to serve the retail channel for the holiday season that is really what typically happens. We did mention the fact that we have incremental product on the water in terms of ocean shipments but I would say that was pretty minor at the end of the quarter.  Amit Daryanani – RBC Capital Markets  In your outsourcing strategy I think you mentioned 46 of the units are manufactured by CMs today or OEMs. Is there a target you can share with us in terms of what you want for the units to be outsourced and is there a time for this target to get there?  Michael Dell  It is a big part of our ongoing discussion around the $4 billion of costs we have talked about this initiative. I don’t think we have shared a specific target for percentage of units. I think there are still decisions to be made in terms of where we go with that. It will be more than 43% and will increase over time. It will increase over the next 12-18 months is really what we are focused on.   Operator The next question comes from the line of [Stephen Fox – CLSA].  [Stephen Fox – CLSA] A question on the SMB segment. As you look at the quarter and look forward I know you have talked about being under penetrated in that market. How much of the growth and the expectation for growth is being driven by go initiatives roughly versus say the market recovery? Then within that how much faster do you think SMB can grow than the large enterprise over the next few quarters?  Michael Dell  What was the first question again?  [Stephen Fox – CLSA] Qualitatively if you could talk about the Dell initiatives to penetrate the SMB market better. How much of that delivered during the quarter and how much are you expecting that to continue in the next couple of quarters? Just trying to understand Dell versus the market in SMB.  Michael Dell  I think for the quarter we maintained our number two share position in SMB with about flat year-over-year share. We are sort of moving with the market right now. We are trying to focus, as we have said, specifically on the more profitable parts of the market and I think you see that in the margin rates that we see in the SMB business which are very good. I think that is sort of how we are thinking about it. There are some places where we will, I think, be well positioned to take some share with SMB as we move forward with some of the solutions that we do.  Brian Gladden  Mix is improving in that business and there is also a bias towards emerging countries where we saw, for example, in China 20% sequential growth and in India I believe it was 26% sequential growth. So BRIC countries revenue grew double digits. On a year-over-year basis India was 68%. China was 16%. We see a lot of opportunity with new business formation in those countries and our direct access to those customers allowing us to provide a full suite of products, services and solutions.  [Stephen Fox – CLSA] Are you more optimistic about SMB versus large enterprise if the cycle continues to improve?  Michael Dell  I think if you look at it from a size of opportunity they are both quite large opportunities. We have different opportunities across the different businesses and we are pursuing them independently and we think they can both deliver nice growth and returns.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Jeff Fidacaro – Susquehanna Financial Group.  Jeff Fidacaro – Susquehanna Financial Group  If we look at EMEA can we talk about the strategy there and your outlook I guess going forward? It has been a little bit more of a challenging environment especially on the PC ASPs. I am just wondering what is the strategy there?  Michael Dell  Well we think it continues to be a great market opportunity for us to grow. We are under penetrated in EMEA. We saw for the first time in awhile some quarter-over-quarter strength with the overall region up 7%. Still down year-over-year but we continue…we have had to make cut backs in EMEA. That is part of our cost action to reposition the business there. I think we are through the majority of that. Continuing to focus on our cost position there is something that is important for us. A very important market and one we will continue to invest in.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. A question on the timing of various hardware categories. It seems like Dell storage and server has seen fairly positive trends over the past couple of quarters. If you could talk about how your customers are thinking about investment in data center hardware versus investment in the client?  Michael Dell  Well as I said earlier I think the mission critical data center activity has been high and the [inaudible] processor brought out the virtualization wave in a big way because it accelerated the number of servers you could virtualize in one platform. We have been particularly strong with our blade offering, with our data center custom solutions, with our storage offerings. We think our 11G combined server and really management solution that goes with that is a fantastic offering that is really resonating with customers. It is a place where there is a bias for investment inside these accounts.  We have also done particularly well I think in some of the mega build outs of the 25 largest web farms in the world. I think we have captured a disproportionate share there with the VCS business. In fact that business if it were a standalone business would probably be the third largest server provider in the US in the fourth quarter, surpassing another brand with three letters.  Again thanks to everyone for joining us. I think you have heard us talk about the beginnings of some sequential improvement in our commercial business and a clear focus on continuing to build out our enterprise solutions portfolio. We look forward to talking to you later this evening and over the course of the next quarter. Thanks.  Operator This concludes today’s conference call. We appreciate your participation.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "  Operator (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein.  Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein Brian you had mentioned because of Windows 7 you had experienced a larger than usual backlog in this quarter exiting the quarter. Can you help quantify how material that was and how we should be thinking about potentially making an adjustment for revenue that maybe would have recognized this quarter had it been more normal and not had that Windows 7 bump and ostensibly how much benefit you might have starting next quarter because of that?  Brian Gladden  I think as you know, we run the business generally with a pretty minimal backlog. I think what we saw was the order patterns especially in SMB and consumer where order rates were somewhat depressed, probably in the two weeks prior to the launch of Windows 7. So the middle two weeks of October. Once we saw the launch happen the order rates picked up significantly. That contributed to some orders that came in the last couple of weeks that obviously we just couldn’t get out given the timing. I wouldn’t call it material enough to impact how you are thinking about the fourth quarter. Again, we do think it is going to be a sequentially improved fourth quarter just based on the order rates we see.  Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein The follow-up for Michael, you had mentioned two quarters ago you expected a powerful PC replacement cycle. Do you still hold that view and should we be thinking about materially above a normal trend PC unit market growth of 10% for 2010?  Michael Dell  I would not be surprised to see it well into the teens. I think there is an aging installed base for sure. You just have an accumulation of new technologies at the hardware, software, virtualized client and these IT managers really know they cannot extend the life of these client assets forever. While I don’t think it is all going to occur at once, I think it will be a rolling refresh that occurs over perhaps 18 months, I can’t remember a time when a very high percentage of them skipped an entire operating system. So what we remind them, and they know this, Windows XP is eight years old. So yes I think it is going to be a pretty possible cycle.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Bill Shope - Credit Suisse.  Bill Shope - Credit Suisse My question is on the potential corporate upgrade cycle as well. Once this cycle begins potentially sometime next year, I suspect other large OEMs will be jockeying for a share of the pie as well. In that instance will you still focus on gross margin preservation over market share stability or does the strategy change somewhat to a more growth oriented focus?  Michael Dell  We think we are holding or gaining share in the right kind of price points. Our efforts on the cost side should expand our ability to profitably compete in a larger portion of the price points. What I would also tell you is that the pipeline of client opportunities we are already seeing more client activity in the last 30-60 days than we have in a long time and the pipeline for client activity kind of going forward into next year is the strongest it has been in a long time as well.

Bill Shope - Credit Suisse Can you comment on how you think about cash usage as we enter a recovery? Should we expect to see you possibly resume some share repurchase activity or is your priority still on acquisitions and other investments with the cash?  Brian Gladden  I think we will continue to look at that. I think clearly we have been through a cycle where we wanted to protect the liquidity and make sure we had adequate cash for survival and obviously some strategic activities. We continue to look at that. As we have opportunities in the marketplace for acquisitions that clearly might be part of the strategy and we will continue to revisit opportunities with the share repurchase as well.

Brian Gladden  We don’t really talk about…those are competitive discussions and actually we would rather not talk about that. So I think what you have is pretty much all we are going to talk about.  Maynard Um - UBS But just from an accounting perspective do vendor payments flow through the COGS line?  Brian Gladden  That depends on the structure of the agreement and how we would arrange that transaction.  Maynard Um - UBS In terms of in the past I guess the street didn’t strip out the amortization of intangibles from pro forma numbers. Given the way you have broken down the pro forma reconciliation should we be excluding those from our pro forma calculations going forward?  Brian Gladden  I think as we said we are going to introduce a Reg G reconciliation next quarter and when we do that we will explain really all the details of that. That will be one element of our reconciliation.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner – Citigroup.  Richard Gardner - Citigroup Just given your comments regarding components I wanted to get a sense number one of how this will affect gross margins in the fourth quarter if we take mix out of the equation?

I know that in the past pricing decisions have been made by the business divisions and sometimes haven’t necessarily agreed with the corporate view of what component pricing is going to do and if you could also talk about whether component availability will be a significant limiter of upside for you in the fourth quarter if demand continues to come back strongly?  Brian Gladden  I think we do have a pretty good grip on where component pricing is going for the quarter. In many cases have negotiated deals that for us provide some level of protection versus where the market is going. I think we are in a reasonable position in terms of availability of components. I do know the industry will have some shortages but I think we are maybe in an advantage position there given some of the negotiations we have done over the last couple of months.

So given we know where these prices are going we are taking actions right now from a price standpoint to try and protect margins.  Richard Gardner - Citigroup So we should really be thinking about mix as being the primary factor on gross margins then going into the fourth quarter?  Brian Gladden  I think that is right. We are going to be doing everything we can to protect the fundamental profitability and mix will be what mix will be.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital.  Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital I have two questions that I guess weren’t addressed.

Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital I guess if it just changed to lower pricing over time…the other thing I was going to ask you was on the tax rate. It was higher than expected and you said due to mix. You also have a Malaysian facility that had a very favorable tax structure. I was wondering if the mix shift towards more contract manufacturing was also impacting the tax rate and making it higher over the long term as the mix maybe moves away from that Malaysian facility maybe you will pay higher taxes elsewhere. If you could explain that effect on your tax rate that would be great.  Brian Gladden  Without getting into a lot of tax planning dialogue, there is not necessarily differentiated tax rate between contract manufacturers and some of our facilities. A lot of it has to do with where the products are ultimately sold. So it is really a mix of geographic and product line mix changes that drive the tax rate changes.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley.  Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley On Windows 7 there has been a relatively clear expectation that the consumer demand uptick is relatively near-term and the enterprise uptick will come sometime later next year but I find your comments around commercial as interesting in terms of the strength you saw in October. Do you think that SMB will act more like consumers and upgrade in the next couple of quarters or do you think they will act more like enterprises?  Brian Gladden  Well the small ones act more like a consumer and the big ones operate more like enterprise. If you push it together SMB is about 50% of Windows 7 today and we think they tend to go first. I should say the momentum we are seeing in the enterprise customer is around client, has nothing to do with Windows 7 at this point. We are seeing a pipeline of Windows 7 that is starting to build for enterprise customers really next year.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan.  Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan In the enterprise accounts where you are seeing improvements right now can you talk a little bit more about the mix? Are these customers targeting more of your higher end or lower end SKUs? Are they also seeking heavier than usual discounts?  Brian Gladden  It is biased towards the enterprise portfolio so the services, solutions, storage, servers are definitely a lot of virtualization type projects are going on. A lot of mission critical activity going on in those accounts. But we are starting to see more client activity than we have in quite some time. There is definitely a bias in all these accounts towards value and they are looking for builds to bring best value solutions.  Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan In PCs you talked earlier about expecting the consumer to be exhibiting the typical seasonal patterns. I am just curious if there anything on the part of Dell or your PC tiers in terms of a concerted push to try to emphasize notebooks over net books this holiday season in terms of driving the improved mix with respect to ASPs? Is there any type of phenomenon taking place?  Brian Gladden  Well I can tell you from our standpoint as we look at retail opportunities we are prioritizing opportunities where margins are best and we would walk away from deals where margin isn’t so good. Netbooks actually is one of the areas that is most challenged given the pricing dynamics right now. So that would tell you we are trying to prioritize higher end products with better profit.  Michael Dell  You can see in our average selling prices ours are more than twice that of some of our competitors.  Operator The next question comes from the line of David Bailey - Goldman Sachs.  David Bailey - Goldman Sachs The non-EqualLogic storage sales were weak this quarter. What are you doing to reverse this trend and how long do you think it will take?  Michael Dell  There is a shift going on there where we are moving away from non-Dell branded storage offerings. You can think of this as dual margin pass through revenue. So our margin on storage continues to increase and with the additional, better mix of sales also comes service annuities which obviously are valuable over time to us. So we are moving more and more to the portfolio f Dell IP, Dell branded and in some cases co-branded products. That is the direction. That is why you see the shift in the mix and the increased margins.  David Bailey - Goldman Sachs Then you said you are starting to see more client activity in the commercial space. Is that RFPs or are you actually starting to ship some PCs into them and if it is RFPs when do you think it will start to kick in?  Brian Gladden  We are seeing orders and shipments increase pretty substantially in kind of the last 30-60 days in those enterprise customers and the pipeline is also increasing.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal.  Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal OpEx, you have taken several hundred million in charges in the April/July and now the October quarter and if we net out some of the charges it looks like OpEx has been about flattish over the three quarters. Can you give any color on what are the OpEx trends we should be thinking about near-term?  Brian Gladden  I think as you know we took out an awful lot coming into the year and that continued through the first quarter. We have continued to, as you know, incurred some organizational effectiveness charges that further reduced the OpEx but a lot of that has moved to COGS during the course of this year as we have addressed some of the manufacturing footprint. I think what you see is we are making some selective investments as I have mentioned and as Michael has mentioned, whether that is in R&D or around some of our key enterprise products. Some of it is around rebuilding sales force capability in certain markets and solutions capability there. Those are things we will continue to do.  As we see some revenue growth return to the business, we think again I think you also see it mix up phenomenon with our move to enterprise products that ultimately will require more OpEx as we think about the shape of the P&L going forward.  Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal My follow-up relates to that. Large enterprise is the lower operating margin business as compared to public and small/medium business with obviously consumers running at a lower level but as smaller relevant size of the pie. So as large enterprise ramps does that end up putting pressure on the operating margin or do you have some scale there that ramps at the same time? I’m just trying to understand what the mix will do if and when large enterprise ramps.  Brian Gladden  We really think that the large enterprise business will scale. It has been the hardest hit in terms of volume. So when that business comes back we expect it will be slightly or pretty flat and we will see some nice improvement in margin rate there.  Operator The next question comes from the line of  Scott Craig – Bank of America.  Scott Craig – Bank of America When you talk about seasonal for the next quarter, maybe a bit of a clarification there. If I exclude the fiscal fourth quarter of 2009 the last couple of years before that seasonality was sort of low single digits on the revenue side. But if you go back a little farther from there you are talking about off typically 5-10%. So maybe some clarification about what you would think sort of normal seasonal patterns would be obviously excluding any impact from Perot. Then I have a quick follow-up.  Brian Gladden  I think it is really hard to look at history given one of the changes in our portfolio so that our consumer mix is going to be bigger than historical and I think consumer is one of the bigger drivers of the fourth quarter. You also have very, very different dynamics in the marketplace in terms of people coming back to buy and some of the refresh stuff taking off and some of the improvements in demand we haven’t seen. So I think it is very hard to tell based on historical demand what you would expect going into the fourth quarter. We do, as we said, think it is going to be sequentially bigger.  Scott Craig – Bank of America With regard to the larger enterprise business, I know this is just one quarter but it was up quarter-over-quarter from a revenue standpoint but operating margin actually declined a little bit so there didn’t appear to be scale there. Can you maybe talk about the dynamics of what happened there from an operating margin perspective quarter-to-quarter?  Brian Gladden  I think it is hard to pull out one quarter and sort of break that apart. Some of it is mix of the business. Some of it is the timing of services as we get some of the balance sheet and some of that comes off. I don’t have specific details on what the margin change would have been.  Michael Dell  I think there are a couple of things that they are trying to accomplish in this environment. That is to continue to make investments in some of their enterprise solutions. A big piece of the EqualLogic investment and next generation platforms is born by the large enterprise group. As you know they are very focused on making investments in their services portfolio and their enterprise solutions portfolio. So they are really committed to kind of biting the bullet here and committed to those investments that they believe are going to pay off as the growth comes back. I will remind you that business was at a peak at about $5 billion quarterly rate and is down significantly to the current levels. So it is just now starting to come back. What we are seeing is the beginnings of some improvement in demand in these commercial accounts and the first time in a number of quarters we have seen sequential growth. So as that sequential growth gradually comes back and hopefully it builds maybe through the middle of next year and the back half of next year that is when some of the operating margin leverage begins to kick in those businesses.  Brian Gladden  Operating income rates were 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter down so pretty flat with gross margin rates up year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. So I think it will scale if we get some volume back.  Operator The next question comes from the line of  Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities.  Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities I wanted to follow-up on that last point. Do you have a target margin which you think about for the commercial business and the enterprise business? Do you think you can take it back somewhere close to where SMB and public currently run?  Brian Gladden  I would just go back to the long-term framework we have given you around operating margin of 7% plus and when we look at all of the things we are doing around COGS and operating expenses and shifting the portfolio here we think that is a good mock up framework to think about but it will go with that portfolio of businesses.  Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities What is implied in that 7% operating margin target for the enterprise business? What is the key variable that gets you there? Is it bigger volume on the existing structure?  Brian Gladden  I think it will be a combination of mix and scale, improved services and more solutions focus. Michael Dell  I think a lot of the things we are doing on costs will ultimately enable some of that growth to help us get the scaling we need for the improvement in the business.  Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities On the M&A strategy, what are the top two or three priorities from a capability standpoint or a technology standpoint you are interested in?  Michael Dell  We are pleased with the Perot acquisition and believe that is a great platform for us. I would say most of our focus would be on smaller targets than Perot. So you shouldn’t be surprised to see a portfolio of small to midsized acquisitions that we think add capability along the themes that we have talked about in terms of solutions and delivering or bringing best value solutions to our customers.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani – RBC Capital Markets.  Amit Daryanani – RBC Capital Markets  Inventory was up about 14% sequentially and while I was expecting some uptick in sales next quarter but the [inaudible]. I am wondering is that some of the backlog you had exiting the quarter or did you have to build some of the component inventory that you foresee some shortages for?  Brian Gladden  I wouldn’t say there is anything unusual in inventory other than we had a traditional seasonal retail staging that happens in the third quarter. So as you look at being in position to serve the retail channel for the holiday season that is really what typically happens. We did mention the fact that we have incremental product on the water in terms of ocean shipments but I would say that was pretty minor at the end of the quarter.  Amit Daryanani – RBC Capital Markets  In your outsourcing strategy I think you mentioned 46 of the units are manufactured by CMs today or OEMs. Is there a target you can share with us in terms of what you want for the units to be outsourced and is there a time for this target to get there?  Michael Dell  It is a big part of our ongoing discussion around the $4 billion of costs we have talked about this initiative. I don’t think we have shared a specific target for percentage of units. I think there are still decisions to be made in terms of where we go with that. It will be more than 43% and will increase over time. It will increase over the next 12-18 months is really what we are focused on.   Operator The next question comes from the line of [Stephen Fox – CLSA].  [Stephen Fox – CLSA] A question on the SMB segment. As you look at the quarter and look forward I know you have talked about being under penetrated in that market. How much of the growth and the expectation for growth is being driven by go initiatives roughly versus say the market recovery? Then within that how much faster do you think SMB can grow than the large enterprise over the next few quarters?  Michael Dell  What was the first question again?  [Stephen Fox – CLSA] Qualitatively if you could talk about the Dell initiatives to penetrate the SMB market better. How much of that delivered during the quarter and how much are you expecting that to continue in the next couple of quarters? Just trying to understand Dell versus the market in SMB.  Michael Dell  I think for the quarter we maintained our number two share position in SMB with about flat year-over-year share. We are sort of moving with the market right now. We are trying to focus, as we have said, specifically on the more profitable parts of the market and I think you see that in the margin rates that we see in the SMB business which are very good. I think that is sort of how we are thinking about it. There are some places where we will, I think, be well positioned to take some share with SMB as we move forward with some of the solutions that we do.  Brian Gladden  Mix is improving in that business and there is also a bias towards emerging countries where we saw, for example, in China 20% sequential growth and in India I believe it was 26% sequential growth. So BRIC countries revenue grew double digits. On a year-over-year basis India was 68%. China was 16%. We see a lot of opportunity with new business formation in those countries and our direct access to those customers allowing us to provide a full suite of products, services and solutions.  [Stephen Fox – CLSA] Are you more optimistic about SMB versus large enterprise if the cycle continues to improve?  Michael Dell  I think if you look at it from a size of opportunity they are both quite large opportunities. We have different opportunities across the different businesses and we are pursuing them independently and we think they can both deliver nice growth and returns.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Jeff Fidacaro – Susquehanna Financial Group.  Jeff Fidacaro – Susquehanna Financial Group  If we look at EMEA can we talk about the strategy there and your outlook I guess going forward? It has been a little bit more of a challenging environment especially on the PC ASPs. I am just wondering what is the strategy there?  Michael Dell  Well we think it continues to be a great market opportunity for us to grow. We are under penetrated in EMEA. We saw for the first time in awhile some quarter-over-quarter strength with the overall region up 7%. Still down year-over-year but we continue…we have had to make cut backs in EMEA. That is part of our cost action to reposition the business there. I think we are through the majority of that. Continuing to focus on our cost position there is something that is important for us. A very important market and one we will continue to invest in.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. A question on the timing of various hardware categories. It seems like Dell storage and server has seen fairly positive trends over the past couple of quarters. If you could talk about how your customers are thinking about investment in data center hardware versus investment in the client?  Michael Dell  Well as I said earlier I think the mission critical data center activity has been high and the [inaudible] processor brought out the virtualization wave in a big way because it accelerated the number of servers you could virtualize in one platform. We have been particularly strong with our blade offering, with our data center custom solutions, with our storage offerings. We think our 11G combined server and really management solution that goes with that is a fantastic offering that is really resonating with customers. It is a place where there is a bias for investment inside these accounts.  We have also done particularly well I think in some of the mega build outs of the 25 largest web farms in the world. I think we have captured a disproportionate share there with the VCS business. In fact that business if it were a standalone business would probably be the third largest server provider in the US in the fourth quarter, surpassing another brand with three letters.  Again thanks to everyone for joining us. I think you have heard us talk about the beginnings of some sequential improvement in our commercial business and a clear focus on continuing to build out our enterprise solutions portfolio. We look forward to talking to you later this evening and over the course of the next quarter. Thanks.  Operator This concludes today’s conference call. We appreciate your participation.

As a reminder, Dell is also simulcasting this presentation with slides at www.dell.com/investor. (Operator Instructions) I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin.  Rob Williams  Thank you, Regina and thanks to everyone for joining us. It's been 83 days since we announced this combination and 43 days since the close and we've made great progress to date. With me today are Peter Altabef, President of Dell Services; Steve Schuckenbrock, President of our Large Enterprise business; Paul Bell, President of Public business; and CFO Brian Gladden. Peter will begin by sharing our view of the overall services opportunity as well as our approach to providing IT solutions. Paul and Steve will then share their perspective on our customer-facing initiatives for their business units, and finally Brian will discuss the financial impact of Perot as well as our decision to provide historical regulation G disclosure data today and going forward with Q4 earnings.  In conjunction with this event, we issued a press release, posted our web deck on dell.com and released a vlog with Peter on Dell Shares. I encourage you to review these for additional perspective.  As a reminder, when we get to the Q&A, please limit your questions to one and one follow-up.  Next, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during these presentations that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties which are discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and on our website.  Please note that in today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation that we have posted on dell.com/investor. We encourage you to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures which you will find on slide 25 of the web deck.  Now I'd like to turn it over to Peter.   Peter Altabef Thank you, Rob. I'm glad to be here with you today and to join the team with Michael and here with Steve, Paul and with Brian. I appreciate the opportunity to address our investors and the financial community. This morning, I will be sharing Dell's perspectives on the changing world of information technology services and business solutions and I have the pleasure of introducing you to the new Dell services as our strategic direction.  Information technology has become a core element in enabling, sustaining, and driving business operations and growth. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, when mainframes emerged in the 1960s, IT investment represented less than one half of 1% of gross domestic product. Since then, IT spending has grown as a percent of GDP with each wave of new technology, from the broad deployment of PCs in the 1980s to the rise of network computing in the 1990s and now the next wave is gathering motion, fuelled by virtualization, cloud-based solutions, and the increasing alignment with IT business outcomes.  Today, approximately 3% of GDP is focused on IT spending and estimates are that that will rise to as much as 4% over the next few years. When you look at the IT industry, it remains extremely fragmented and in fact, there are only four companies that offer a full set of integrated service offerings all the way from the manufacturing and support of sophisticated broad hardware solutions through applications development, business process, business and IT consulting, and ultimately that results in what I will consider the comprehensive suite of IT services. Dell is one of the small handful that do that and is one of the 10 largest globally focused services providers.  Studies by Forrester Research show that today 72% of business executives believe technology is how they differentiate themselves from their competitors. That's a remarkable percentage and when you look at the long-term value of those more efficient companies with more cost effective operations and more competitive differentiation, they obviously perform better.  Significantly, however, look at where customers spend their money -- that is disproportionately spent in IT on labor, services, and software. Most businesses typically spend two times more operating on labor IT than they actually spend on the acquisition of the technology itself. Dell believes that labor efficiency can improve and these costs can be reduced dramatically but to do so requires new technology and a paradigm shift in the new service delivery models.  The old approach of embedding an army of consultants locked in processes, frameworks, and proprietary software and hardware, is inefficient and burdens consumers and their customers with too high of a cost. In contrast, we want to help organizations innovate and focus on strategic objectives while spending less on routine IT management. This is a new initiative that is redefining services from the customer's perspective, making IT easier to access and simpler to manage and most importantly, aligning our solutions to our customers' success.  To help customers achieve their desired outcomes, our primary focus areas include reducing the labor requirements by increasing automation, not just reducing the cost of the labor involved. Using global standards, along with the best practices in our industry, performing tasks remotely wherever possible, applying IT as a service model, which includes both software as a service and applications as a service, as well as infrastructure as a service where appropriate, and combining Dell Services vertical industry knowledge, knowledge of our customers' businesses and the situations where our customers find themselves to our technical domain knowledge to help customers [speak].  The next slide is one that was considered at the time we were doing the acquisition discussions and in fact, that's true of the next two slides, so there is a little bit of inside baseball here. This is a view of the strengths and relative complementary-ness of the two preceding organizations. So let's take a look at it.  Dell became an IT leader through a highly efficient build-to-order hardware solution, I think everyone knows that. When you take that business methodology and the workflow associated with that, we believe we can do the same thing in services -- reducing complexity and driving out inefficiencies across the service and support life cycle. Dell Services is large enough to be credible yet nimble enough to lead a transformation in the services industry. At 42,000, and you will see the revenue numbers of approximately $7.5 billion, we have plenty of heft in the industry but we are not burdened by some of the fixed costs and fixed ways of doing things that you might find in some competitive situations.  In addition to scale, the components that now form Dell Services have a comprehensive range of strengths and a consistent history of creating award-winning customer experience. The combination of solutions and teams from each company creates growth opportunities through cross-selling but even more significantly presents the opportunities to participate in a broader range of sale activities.  On the next slide, you will see even more graphically the complementary-ness of the Perot Systems and the Dell teams going into the acquisition. And I didn’t speak about the Perot Systems strengths on the slide before because I really wanted to focus on this slide. Again, this is an inside baseball slide but it shows you in the blue dots where we thought that the Dell legacy services team has significant strengths and then in the red dots where the Perot Systems legacy team had significant strengths. And you can see that while there is some overlap, the result is an extraordinarily broad set of services.  We focus both horizontal technology domain capabilities and then we apply them to specific vertical industries. The result is a best-in-class suite of intelligent end-to-end services and business solutions to reduce IT complexity and lower costs. Through our knowledge of industry requirements, we then tailor industry specific solutions that solve business problems and deliver the best value for the resources invested.  As you look at that slide, you will see areas where there were bullets, both from Dell legacy and Perot Systems legacy. Just as a note in terms of the integration, where that has occurred we have already combined those teams to get both efficiency and best of breed technology and focus. That work is actually already accomplished.  Moving to the next slide, going forward, we believe that these will be fundamental strengths that will differentiate the Dell services approach. The first is interesting and in some respects goes without saying, which is why we need to say it often. We will be intensely customer focused. While a lot of services organizations say those words, the proof is really in the way that is implemented. You will find that Dell services will implement customer focus with the same intensity that the pro systems legacy team did and with the same intensity that the Dell legacy team did.  Domain knowledge -- industry experience in specific vertical industries, whether that's healthcare, government, manufacturing, telecommunications, and other industries, is a competitive advantage that will allow us to add long-term value through industry focused solutions.  Breadth of services -- you have seen in the other charts the wide horizontal technology services that Dell brings to bear. The fact that we can apply our services, methodologies and needs all the way back to the manufacturing process and in fact even into such things as bios is a competitive advantage for us.  Global delivery model -- modular services, to put customers in control, allowing them to select only what they need which means lower cost for consumers. Both Dell and Perot Systems were focused not only in servicing the largest clients but also in servicing small and medium-sized businesses. We believe that we have a unique opportunity to take services through the creation and development of modular services and bring cost-efficient services to smaller businesses that previously have been under-served by the services community.  Finally, in recurring revenue, we have nearly $14 billion in annual and annuity like revenue.  I made a few references to what Dell Services looks like and now I will just kind of sum that up. With $7.5 billion of revenue, we have global reach and we have more than 42,000 employees. The organization generates approximately three-quarters of its revenue from infrastructure and related services, 18% from applications and consulting, and 7% from business process services. We serve the entire spectrum of potential clients, from large organizations to consumers. And we see the combination of our solutions and teams, creating enhanced growth opportunities through cross-selling opportunities as well as being presented the opportunity to participate in a broader range of sales activities. Again, with that focus on modular activities, we believe we will be brining services to a wider and wider swath of the kind of customers that will be able to use them.  This is an exciting time and we are stronger now that we are combined. We can fill out and have already filled out the capabilities in the slides you saw earlier. We will qualify for more RFPs and win more deals but more importantly, we think that we will be expanding the services market and weighing into that expanded space.  To follow-up on that discussion, I'd like to introduce to you Paul Bell and Steve Schuckenbrock.  Paul Bell  Thanks, Peter. I'll speak first to the public sector and I want to at the outset say how much we are really enjoying working with Perot so much more closely now. We've been working together for a couple of years in the public sector. But now that we are integrating and going to the market as one team, it's creating tremendous opportunities for us to support our customers in fulfilling their fundamental mission, particularly in government and healthcare accounts.  We've  also found, frankly, that the cultures had meshed very, very well in the quarters and years that we had a chance to work together and so I think that's been tremendous, to create momentum in the organizations and make this a very natural combination at the face of the customer.  If you look at the greatest areas of overlap that we have had separately, they were with the U.S. Federal Government and with healthcare globally and in the federal government space, we have a tremendous strength now going to market together because the legacy Dell side was already working with 95% of the U.S. federal agencies. We support the Department of Defense literally all over the world and as you can see on the chart here, we have greatly increased the range and depth of services that we can provide to these accounts, many of which we have had very, very longstanding relationships with.  When you look at the federal government space, some of the things that are very, very important to understanding their mission and helping them solve their IT challenges are having clear resources, for instance. People who can actually work within the facilities and get to know the teams. Dell had quite a number of top secret and SCI cleared resources. Perot has even more. That opens up specific opportunities to work on cyber security and other challenges within the intelligence community and DOD that are great businesses for both teams together.  We also have a very wide range of other services that you see listed on the chart that are fundamental right now in the federal government in addressing the challenges of over-complexity and high cost infrastructures. Everybody is very conscious right now of the need to deal with challenged budgets and we are working with a number of these agencies and across the DOD on projects that really can fundamentally reshape the cost structure of the IT infrastructure and we just have many, many more opportunities now to address those customer requirements.  Healthcare, of course, is the area of single greatest overlap between our businesses and where we have the greatest scale, particularly in the care and provider markets here in the United States. We serve many -- well, actually, I should say most of the hospitals and hospital systems in the United States. We have a particular strength in dealing with mid-sized organizations, both Perot and Dell historically had a tremendous strength there, and in providing everything from the complete IT infrastructure that Dell in many cases was providing all the way through in Perot's case the business process outsourcing for billing and other services and now that combination is very, very powerful.  We've had a chance in the several months since we've announced this combination to spend a lot of time with our customers and I can tell you that the reaction to this combination has been uniformly positive. It starts with customers who are already doing business with both of us and just saw this as a tremendous way for us to integrate the activity for them to get a more streamlined way of getting things done and that includes a customer I had dinner with about a month ago that was one of Perot's largest healthcare customers in the past but a lot of their infrastructure was Dell and they just saw this as a uniformly positive thing.  For those customers that had been more one or the other, either Perot or Dell, we still get a very positive response and they are interested in understanding in detail what is this going to mean for them. We had a customer advisory session in Miami last week that Peter and I both attended with a number of healthcare customers. Again, these had been more Dell legacy customers and their reaction again was excited that we have way more to offer them and the reminder for all of us was to be very customer-centric in this approach. We can do so much and have such an unusually broad range of offerings for customers, as Peter said earlier, that the important thing is to tailor them to what that particular customer needs, whether it's all the way out the full IT outsourcing and BPO or more project-based work. We are here to respond to what the customer is looking for.  If you go to the next page, you will see two specific areas that predate this combination where we were working together. These go back to the early part of this year. And mobile clinical computing, of course, had [inaudible] in both companies even before that. But this is a particular type of solution relevant to hospitals and visualize that doctor, other clinician making rounds in a hospital and not happy with the technology solution they have for accessing patient records, medical images, and the other things they need to provide great care. Maybe they are pushing a cart around, maybe they are carrying a device that is too heavy and they don’t want to be dealing with it.  Well, what we've been implementing now have a number in the marketplace in North America and Western Europe are solutions where basically leveraging client virtualization the clinician can have their session be mobile with them and they can go up to any device in any room and pick up exactly where they left off.  That is driving efficiency, it's driving clinician satisfaction and it's quite sophisticated. It's quite a bit to put together to make that solution work. We are offering it together before this combination and now we'll be able to engineer and integrate solutions to a greater degree.  The other example is in electronic medical records, which many of you will know has been the market of the future for a long, long time that never quite arrived. Our penetration of electronic medical records globally is low. Here in the United States, you will hear it estimated between 10% to 20% of physicians are using them but this is a very, very big part of what the Obama administration for one is really trying to incent and the ARRA of earlier this year actually is providing about $19 billion of incentives to do that.  Now, between Perot and Dell, we had been working with a number of the largest software providers in creating an integrated infrastructure and application solution for larger hospital groups. One of the more innovative pieces that draws on both of our capabilities is what we call the affiliated physicians EMR solution and that's getting out to that last mile, so to speak, the hardest to reach part of the healthcare community which is the small physician practices. And we've got the right solutions, we've integrated it end-to-end. It's largely being delivered as a SaaS based model so that the small practices don’t need to have a lot of infrastructure on site. And that's a clear marriage of the traditional Dell and Perot strength. And it's also a great start in the second half  of the year.  We are very optimistic about where this whole space is going because of the incentives and because of the clear benefits to the clinical process and we think we will be able to drive even further innovation in the space to really help solve customers' problems.  With that, let me turn it over to Steve Schuckenbrock. Steve Schuckenbrock Thanks, Paul and I will echo everything that you said without repeating it, that the enthusiasm for the combination is quite terrific, not only internally where our teams I think have gelled quite nicely. The cultures have come together quite well but also as you said with the customers, there simply is enthusiasm for what we can now offer and one of the things that has been the focus of Dell as well as the focus of Perot is outstanding support from mid-sized to mid to large kind of customers. And many of these customers are actually not interested in doing business with the really big outsourcing firms because they feel like they will be lost in the noise as they continue to scramble on some of those big deals. They don’t see that with the combination of Perot and with Dell and in fact, they have enthusiastically come to us with even some sole-sourced deals since the announced combination and so we have a couple of those that we are working in the pipe and it's really nice to see that the reputation of both of the firms brings that kind of confidence from the customers.  When you look at the large enterprise space, we have through the combination about three times the size of the services business and large enterprise coming from Dell legacy versus Perot and what that should tell you is we have terrific relationships with customers through the Dell traditional approach but now we have a whole set of new capabilities that we can bring to bear with those customer relationships and that's exactly what is happening. We're seeing the pipeline grow and while a lot of outsourcing companies will talk to you about the big mega deals and the huge billion dollar opportunities that they continue to pursue, even though those deals have wanted to come down through time, the sweet spot for Perot Systems or now Dell Services is a contract value of up to $50 million and terms that range from three to six year kind of timeframes. We love those type of deals, we do a lot of them, and we do them across a space that is really laid out on the next chart.  I just repeated Peter's chart because I think it's a really good way to talk to this and I will tell you the focus in large enterprise will continue to be all the blue dots but rather than a real vertical approach here in the short-term because both -- I think we have the opportunity to build out even more vertical capabilities in this combination, there are a lot of horizontal opportunities that are lined out in these blue areas, and I'll just cite a couple.  First, we have been pretty good at the end user computing area but we've had lots of request from customers for what we can do for them in the data center and with the network and how we can help them manage the complexity, especially given the significant transitions of infrastructure that are occurring in the data center. So bring in a combination of Dell hardware and software solutions along with these services solutions and offering them in a manage-it-yourself, we'll manage it for you or completely, even cloud based versions of those solution sets, are really great opportunities for us.  Peter and Paul both talked to the opportunities in software as a service and infrastructure as a service. We will expand our modular services strategy that we've talked to you about before through this combination, and one of the things that I've said multiple times to this audience is we were looking for a company that was large enough to give us the reputation that we need in the services space and Perot has absolutely filled that bill, but also small enough and flexible enough to embrace the future of services as opposed to being totally wed to the large outsourcing opportunities and the major labor based approaches to providing those services.  I am particularly excited about the application space and I want to draw your attention to modernization and management. Through modernization, we are seeing and through significant shifts that are occurring in the industry, not the least of which is the tremendous capability of the new Intel processor sets, we are seeing a significant migration from proprietary infrastructure, mainframe, Unix, et cetera, to open architectures sourced often through Dell.  That requires a migration of the applications and a rationalization of the code base and we see this new capability that we have never had in our direct capability or our direct control as a significant advantage that we can bring to customers as we help them in the simplification of their infrastructure, in driving cost out on an ongoing basis, and opening the architectures in the way that our customers absolutely continue to demand from not only us but from many of the other OEMs in the market as well.  We haven’t talked much about IT consulting in this call but what I would tell you is the motions that we put in place, Paul was very instrumental in it as well, over the last several years where we go in and work with customers to take their pain points and map their pain points to specific approaches that are based on best practices across all of the other customers that we serve, as well as Dell's own internal best practices from an IT standpoint, and then map that solution out with a customer with really quick hit kinds of projects where we bring two to three resources to bear over the course of 60 to 90 days and our competitors continue to bring teams of consultants that don’t want to go away, is alive and well. And that business is growing nicely for us and has proven very sticky for driving a lot of our enterprise [inaudible] into the customer space.  Those are the horizontal approaches to the market and if you flip to the next page, it will show you that there are industry capabilities that we have now taken on as a result of this combination. These are not scaled capabilities yet at this point but they offer IP and opportunity for us to expand, for example, in the industry solutions around asset and fleet management with rental car companies, or we have seen significant opportunity from the financial services space as well as the insurance space, especially in the application area where legacy Perot has fantastic application skill sets and rich experience in their history.  So we will look forward to moving from the horizontal into the vertical as we expand this business in LE and we are pretty excited about the fact that our pipe just in the last 40 days, 45 days, 43 days, if you will, has already generated 50 plus leads that are really significant and a couple of deals that have already closed even inside of that 43 day window. So we are real excited about it and can't tell you how well this fits our overall strategy to become a solutions company.  Brian Gladden Thanks, Steve. This is Brian Gladden. We are now on slide 19 and I'd like to start by taking you through how we are thinking about integration. We are building broad capability here that will be lasting and beyond just the Perot integration. We are fortunate enough to have Dave Johnson, who many of you know, who is our senior VP of strategy, very engaged in driving the integration process for us. Dave brings a strong background and over 25 years of execution and integration experience and he has really helped us refine a playbook for Perot and what we will use for future transactions.  We have defined four basic success factors that are pretty consistent with most integration plans -- leadership, governance, execution of visions and synergies and people management. We have many other dedicated integration executives engaged in the process, leading 17 different work streams, covering everything from our go-to-market strategy to service delivery and operations to corporate IT and cost rationalization. With the entire process being overseen by a cross-functional senior steering committee.  We put in place several specific metrics to ensure the key metrics around customer retention, retention of our key talent, revenue and cost synergy targets, and ultimately to ensure that we are on track with these synergies, we are looking at these milestones against 30, 60, 90 day targets and doing that on a weekly basis.  And as with any acquisition, retaining the key talent is a top priority. By the announcement date of September 21st, we had already reached retention agreements with the majority of Perot's top leadership team and since then, we have retained and named all level one to level three leaders to their positions across the company.  Under Peter, Russell, and Don's leadership, and with direction and guidance from Dave, we believe Perot is well-positioned and established as a model for future acquisitions for Dell.  Switching gears, the next few slides, beginning with slide 20, focus on our synergy plans and preliminary purchase accounting estimates. By growing organically, bolting on other assets including our own and globalizing our solutions portfolio, we can build a stronger global servicers offering. It is really about expanding the pie as well as enjoying its growth.  We have identified $650 million in incremental revenue synergies over the next three years and divided that into three areas. The short-term opportunities are primarily focused on cross-selling of services and hardware between the two organizations.  We have medium term opportunities that are more focused on the vertical growth in the three areas we talked about -- healthcare, where EMR will drive a big ramp over the next couple of years; government, where Dell can now qualify as a prime contractor on many more opportunities than before; and in commercial, where as Steve discussed, it's an area with a lot of white space and an opportunity where we have great capability to scale.  Finally, additional incremental long-term opportunities are primarily geographic in nature, and they will grow as we increase our capacity by geography via organic investments and select bolt-on acquisitions similar to the Bering Point China acquisition that Perot announced in October.  On the cost side, we have identified areas that combine and capture synergies in the integration. In total, we have over $4 billion in shared annual spending that we are targeting. Of this, we have found over $300 million in cost reductions, which comes from the consolidation of our IT infrastructure and application development capability, from OpEx reductions related to duplicate functions within G&A, and consolidating indirect procurement and services delivery costs.  But to break that out a little bit further, about 75% of the cost savings will come from the existing Dell infrastructure, particularly in IT and services delivery. To date, we have identified an action to over 90% of these savings, including $92 million of the $100 million we are targeting for fiscal year 11. We will continue to validate additional savings through the existing work streams and balance these savings against investments we need to make to grow the business.  Turing to the purchase accounting, we are still finalizing our work here but want to give you our best estimates and ranges as we see them today. We see good will of about $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion that will show up on the balance sheet of Dell and additionally an approximately $1.2 billion in purchased intangibles. We also want to provide you a view of how that will quarterly amortize in the P&L. Amortization of purchased intangibles will be roughly $40 million to $50 million in Q4 at $45 million to $50 million in each quarter of fiscal year 2011.  In addition, acquisition related expenses will be $120 million to $130 million in the fourth quarter and roughly $20 million to $25 million per quarter during the next fiscal year.  Finally, there will likely be a few adjustments to deferred revenue, deferred costs, and fair market valuation of other assets but these aren’t large enough to call out individually and are generally immaterial.  Moving to page 23, as you know, we closed the transaction on November 3rd and we will report Dell's fourth quarter results on February the 18th. At that point, we will have a full quarter of Perot Systems' results consolidated into our P&L.  So as you adjust your models, I wanted to provide you with a P&L on this slide for the past year and to touch on a few of the items from their Q3 results that you will need to factor in going forward.  In the third quarter, Perot Systems revenue was $629 million, which was down 12% year over year and flat sequentially. Gross margins were 19.4% and operating income was 6.8% of revenue. As a reminder, about 72% of Perot's quarterly revenue comes from backlog that is in place when they enter the quarter. So you should expect to see a relatively similar result in the fourth quarter though Perot does typically see some seasonal softness in the fourth quarter, generally due to less billable days because of the holidays.  Perot delivered in their third quarter $85 million in cash flow from operations and on a rolling 12-month basis has delivered $240 million in cash flow from operations, mostly in the U.S., which for us helps our domestic liquidity going forward.  When considering Perot's use of working capital and cash conversion cycle, we believe that Dell's cash conversion cycle will be affected by about two to three days as we consolidate Perot.  Finally, to wrap up our discussion on Perot, I wish to reiterate that Perot makes sense for us both financially and strategically and we expect this acquisition to be accretive to our P&L on a non-GAAP basis in year one.  Now let me shift our discussion a little bit on page 24 to present non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with our earnings release in the fourth quarter and going forward. After an extensive review, discussions with many of you, and benchmarking our industry peers, we have made the decision to provide additional regulation G disclosure, which bridges GAAP and non-GAAP information. I will do this beginning in our fourth quarter. This will allow us to provide investors with a clearer view of items such as acquisition, purchased intangible, and amortization, acquisition related expenses, and organizational effectiveness charges.  This is consistent with how our management team evaluates and measures the business and we believe it is more in line with the vast majority of our technology peers. When we discuss non-GAAP results going forward, we will exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles, we will exclude organizational effectiveness actions, and we will exclude acquisition related costs. But the non-GAAP results will include ongoing equity based compensation. Many of you do follow this number so we will continue to call it out in our talking points each quarter with a breakdown between COGs and OpEx.  Many of these items which we are excluding tend to have a large non-cash component and we will call these out where appropriate in subsequent quarters.  On slide 25, we have put a table that illustrates our historical GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of net income and earnings per share, with the corresponding adjustments and current best estimates for what we see in the fourth quarter for these adjustments.  You see the incremental amortization of purchased intangible raises our current run-rate of $40 million per quarter to roughly $90 million per quarter. Additionally, in the fourth quarter for Dell, we expect organizational effectiveness expenses of between $80 million and $120 million. This is our best estimate as of today and could vary depending on how quickly we could transfer assets in our Poland facility and other optimization actions and programs across the company.  Acquisition related expenses in the fourth quarter will be $120 million to $130 million as we previously described.  Finally, I wish to remind you from our third quarter earnings call that we expect to incur approximately $50 million per quarter in interest expense going forward, given the current debt balance we have in the company. And our investments, our invested cash, is currently returning about 30 basis points on the balance per year.  And finally, our tax rate for the third quarter was 34.5%, which was driven by an increased mix of profits in higher tax jurisdictions and our mix shift to enterprise products and services. As we said, our current view for the full year tax rate is between 29% and 30%, which is the same as our year-to-date rate in the P&L.  So before we close and move to Q&A, I'll make a few quick points -- we do believe Perot Systems, which is now integrated to become the Dell Perot Services, will significantly expand our already important enterprise solutions capability and enhance our position in some of the fastest growing customer segments we see.  We plan $650 million in incremental revenue opportunities and $300 million in targeted cost synergies over the next three years. We will execute on these plans.  The combination of Dell and Perot is a solid strategic fit and a key example of how we intend to deliver on our long-term value creation commitments that we have discussed.  We are focused on improving our core business through tighter linkage with our customers, dramatically improving our product cost position, especially in the client business, and improving on our online presence with Dell.com. We are expanding our reach into the enterprise and improving our ability to deliver customer-centric turn-key enterprise solutions. And we will balance our results to deliver solid growth and profitability with a constant focus on cash returns.  As we see demand returning to more normalized levels, we think we can grow revenue between 5% and 7% over a longer term period. We think we can generate operating income at or above 7% of revenue and we think we can continue to deliver great cash flow from operations that exceeds our net income.  With that, let me now turn it over to Regina for Q&A.  Question-and-Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions)  Toni Sacconaghi, Sanford Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein I have a question and a follow-up, please. Can you detail what's in the $300 million in acquisition related expenses? And ultimately how many people do you believe will be coming out as a result of the acquisition? The rough rule of thumb is typically that it might cost $50,000 to eliminate a position, which would suggest 6,000 people, which I don’t think is the case here. So I'm trying to understand what comprises the $300 million in acquisition related expenses.  Brian Gladden As we've said, this acquisition is not your typical cost focused integration activity here. I mean, I think we are looking at the consolidation of our IT infrastructure as really being the biggest driver of the synergy dollars. When you look at headcount actions and how we are thinking about that, there are some actions probably around G&A as we look at that and that that would be -- to be expected. We will be investing to add resources really around many of these growth and revenue programs that the team talked about.  When you look at the costs that are specified here in the details, I mean, they are one-time costs related to option accelerations and some small pieces related to severance and then there are costs related to getting our systems working together and getting the processes in place across the business in order for this to function effectively as a consolidated services business.  Peter Altabef I'll just add to that -- the internal Dell IT staff had some world-class people in it and one of the things that will happen to this -- through this acquisition is the ability to take those people who have done remarkably industry-leading services such as on server virtualization where Dell is one of the world leaders in virtualizing its own back office, taking those skills and bringing them to bear on client engagement.  So in addition to becoming more efficient internally, we are going to try to bring some of that experience and enhance our customer-facing [inaudible].  Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein Okay, thank you. And just a follow-up if I try and synthesize your comments on puts and takes on non-GAAP income for fiscal year 2011, you are essentially saying if we assume Perot has the incremental revenue growth synergies that we might expect $160 million to $200 million in non-GAAP income from Perot, you are going to get an incremental $100 million in cost synergies, so that's $300 million. And then Dell should get about $160 million less amortization of intangibles from standalone Dell so as we bridge GAAP to non-GAAP for next year, we should be thinking about roughly $450 million delta associated with that migration and including Perot -- is that the right way to think about it? Brian Gladden I think that math works. I think you are right on.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Bailey with Goldman Sachs. David Bailey - Goldman Sachs Could you talk a little bit about how you are thinking about the incremental investment that you are going to need to make to grow the services business, and how that compares to the savings that you outlined on slide 21? Brian Gladden I think as we go through the revenue synergies and the top line opportunities that were on page 20, that is where we think about investing and we have spent time really actually over the last couple of days as we start looking into even fiscal year 11 budgeting process, really debating where those opportunities might be to more aggressively invest in capacity, whether that's services delivery capacity, whether that is selling capacity, or whatever else we need to accelerate the growth here, even beyond these revenue synergies that we talk about on page 20.  So we have sort of isolated that investment and had that discussion based on ROI as it competes with other programs across Dell. The investment required to get at the cost reductions on page 21 is really kind of baked into the plan and that's -- that we have pretty good line of sight to what that is going to require. So I think there's two levels of investment that you will see.  David Bailey - Goldman Sachs  So any investment that you make will offset the cost synergies that you are talking about? Brian Gladden Well, maybe not necessarily -- I mean, we may invest in OpEx around the selling team to support expanding geographic footprint for Perot. That may be an OpEx investment we choose to do that's pretty much independent of anything we have shown you here.  David Bailey - Goldman Sachs I'm just trying to find out if that's a net or a gross number, so it sounds like that's the savings and then any incremental investment will offset some of that? Brian Gladden Yeah, I think that's right.  David Bailey - Goldman Sachs Thank you.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal I wanted to ask a question related to slide 20, specifically on the medium and longer term expansion or revenue growth enhancement opportunities, when you are getting into large enterprise, it's a fragmented market but very competitive. It's not obvious that Perot's or Dell is going to capture share -- how do you anticipate grabbing share there? And Brian, if you could talk a little bit about you've made it pretty clear that you are open to, or intend to do future acquisitions but how does this longer, medium and longer term opportunity relate to what you have in place today versus what you would look to in terms of your acquisition strategy. Thanks.  Steve Schuckenbrock I'll take the large enterprise in terms of capturing share in the services space specifically -- one, we've got a pretty good base to start with and number two is that our account teams on the Dell side have a phenomenal relationships with tens of thousands of customers across the globe.  Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal Excuse me for interrupting, but a lot of that is on the client side and I'm just not sure that translates into capturing enterprise wins with the larger organizations.  Steve Schuckenbrock That's actually not accurate that it's all on the client side. We have a terrific number of relationships on the enterprise side and in fact, are growing faster than the market in the enterprise side each and every quarter and so we feel terrific about the solutions we have in the data center, inclusive of our storage solutions, so that is just not accurate. And our ability to translate those relationships to broader services is already something that is proving itself out in all of the dialogs we are having with the customers.  So from my perspective, our ability to take a $16 billion enterprise business and continue to expand it with these new capabilities that we have just acquired is pretty straightforward exercise and it's about the execution of our sales teams.  Peter Altabef I would add to that -- if you look at the traditional, the Perot Systems legacy client relationships as well, we have had a very positive reaction to those -- that client base being interested in some of the services type activities that Dell has traditionally provided. So when you look at things like pro support and pro manage and all of the close to the client or close to the box support services that Dell has a very substantial business in, we are finding real interest among the Perot Systems clients, many of whom are large enterprise in that work as well. So I think that cross-selling opportunity generally and genuinely is going both ways.  Brian Gladden With regard to the acquisitions, I mean, as you look at some of the longer term opportunities here, geographic expansion is one of the biggest and as you know, the base Perot business was 85% of the business was in the U.S. As you look at our footprint outside the U.S., about 50% of Dell's revenues have come from outside the U.S., so a terrific opportunity organically to grow there but building out capability whether it's solution selling or whether it's consulting or whether it's actually services capacity to support European business or activity in APJ would be very logical opportunities and the Bering Point acquisition is a good example in China.  Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal And Brian, any sense on when you would be comfortable even from the fact of either cash balances or you are adding about 30% new headcount to combined Dell, when would you feel comfortable that this integration is done and therefore be willing to look at other acquisitions? And then I'll cede the floor. Thank you.  Brian Gladden I think it depends on the size and it depends on -- you know, the process is going well and I wouldn’t say that the cash balances are constrained at this point. We've still got $10 billion of cash. So it's a matter of really -- you know, we're talking about other targets right now and it's just a matter of finding something that makes sense and our ability to digest, which again that would depend on where the acquisition is. If it's in the services space, we can digest small things right now. If it's in other spaces around the enterprise, we can probably do something a little bit bigger.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup. Richard Gardner - Citigroup I am not sure if my memory is correct on this but I think at the time of the acquisition, you were actually talking about $800 million to $1 billion in shared costs in areas where there was overlap between Perot activities and Dell activities. And today you are talking about $300 million in combined cost reductions.  So I guess question number one is have you gone back and reassessed that $800 million to $1 billion in overlap areas? Or are you just being conservative on your synergy assumptions?  And then I guess number two is more of a statement -- I think in general most people today would say that you are probably a little bit more aggressive on your revenue synergy targets and a little less aggressive on your cost synergy targets than we might have expected, so maybe you could comment on that as well.  Brian Gladden I think we've been pretty clear that this was an acquisition about gaining capacity and a platform for growth, so the fact that we are more aggressive on our revenue synergies I think is exactly consistent with that message. That's what we talked about with the board and that's what we are doing.  The second, or the first part of your question we talked about the fact that we've asked Perot to basically run all of the Dell Services business. So the integration activity is really consolidating our existing Dell Services business with Peter's Perot Systems business that ultimately becomes a $7.5 billion business with over $4 billion of costs that we are attacking here. So when we talked about finding $300 million even an announcement we were talking about $300 million out of a $4 billion opportunity and that's why I think that's achievable and again, we are leaning on the growth is really the primary focus of our energy.  Unidentified Participant It goes right back to Perot's business was a very well-run business at time of acquisition and so the disciplines that they bring to growth are fundamental to our growth strategy going forward as we bring those same kind of operational controls and decision processes to the growth strategies that Paul and I will pursue. And as the teams are coming together, what we are seeing is the need to invest in resources based on this demand and so Paul -- Peter's comments a few minutes ago relative to repurposing some of the IT team to those opportunities is a great example of the fact that we have the opportunity to take bases of our cost structure and remission them towards our growth strategies and we are in the process of doing that and we see, as Brian said, that growth is if anything where we feel we have great upside.  Richard Gardner - Citigroup So I guess the right way to think about it is that the difference between the $300 million you are talking about today and the $800 million to $1 billion of overlap is reinvestment back into the growth strategy.  Rob Williams  I'm not really sure where the $800 million to $1 billion came from. We've always been a $4 billion in share costs, so we'll take this offline and cover it after the call.  Richard Gardner - Citigroup Okay. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley Have you seen examples of revenue synergies from cross-selling in the first 43 days? If so, where have you found the low-hanging fruit and if not, how long do you think it takes for that revenue upside to show up? And then I have a quick follow-up.  Peter Altabef That's a great question. One of the things that I think everyone on this call is seeing is the speed with which this transaction is moving forward with the -- even the announcement on September 21st, we closed the transaction on November 3rd. On November 3rd, we had Dell services formed, so the 42,000 people were actually all in one organization the day of or within 24 hours after the actual confirmation of the merger.  On November 3rd, we provided to the sales teams what we called a quick start manual, which provided a -- not only a commission plan for new synergy opportunities but also a how-to manual. We gave it to both sales teams from the legacy Perot as well as the Dell legacy teams.  So far, that has resulted in 88 new pursuits that we are now monitoring and tracking as incremental additional pursuits. And as Steve mentioned, some of those have already brought to bear and we have closed. So an example of one of those would be for a manufacturing company that was a traditional Dell client on the hardware side that needed work in SAP, consulting, and implementation. And we were able to bring in the Perot legacy SAP consulting and implementation team and start providing those services. That transaction closed in terms of the contract about 10 days ago. Actually, less than 10 days ago.  So there will be some of these very, very fast two weeks sales cycle opportunities, most of them obviously will take more than two weeks but we think we are getting immediate traction both on the large enterprise and in the public sector in Paul Bell's world as well, and that 88 opportunities covers opportunities both in healthcare, in some government, as well as in the large enterprise and the medium business area.  Unidentified Participant That's a great example, Peter, of the question before of how are we going to gain share. This opportunity wasn’t even on the radar screen before the combination and based on the relationship in this case of the Dell direct team, we uncovered it and closed it in a matter of weeks. I think it's a phenomenal statement to what our customers believe -- or the confidence that our customers have in this new platform.  Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley And then just a quick question for Brian -- given Perot's 19.4% gross margin last quarter, any reason Dell wouldn’t benefit from the accretion on that line in the fourth quarter? Brian Gladden I think that's fundamentally right, Katy. We'll get a bit of a mix-up on that and as we balance all the things going on in that line, including consumer mix and component costs and other things going on, I think that's right.  Rob Williams  Thanks, Katy. I think we've got time for one more question.  Operator  We'll take our final question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.  Shannon Cross - Cross Research Thank you very much. Can you talk a bit about the -- how you are training the sales force for both Dell and Perot, as well as what you have done in terms of changes to comp plans since sales people will generally sell what they are paid to sell, so I am curious on how you are really pushing further cross-selling opportunities.  Peter Altabef I'll speak to it very, very quickly and then ask Paul and Steve to add comments on the specific teams that they are most familiar with. First of all, it's not just the sales force. So one of the other things we did, because in many cases sales opportunities or leads are actually led by the lead person associated with the customer. That could be a sales person and actually could be an operating person, so let's just call it a customer executive. And one of the things we did again on November 3rd, so we've been at this now five weeks, was we identified on the day we were closing the one lead customer executive for each of our joint customers. We mapped all of the Perot Systems and all of the Dell customers and where we had joint customers, we actually chose a lead customer executive and said you are the point person for driving both services and non-services revenues in coordination with the other teams. So that's been very effective and I just wanted to say that just so you know that this work goes beyond sales executives alone.  And with respect to the sales teams, as I said, we do have a quick start program where we are basically saying as you identify opportunities, like the one Steve just talked about that really wasn’t on the table before this transaction, we will make sure that we can get them commission very, very quickly that are in some cases incremental to commissions that they had before simply because we want them excited about the deal and we want people to really be unearthing opportunities and win stories.  With that, I'll turn it over to Paul and Steve.  Paul Bell  I'll just add a few things to what Peter said. One is since this is the first quarter post close, the main comp piece was what Peter talked about in terms of incentives to both teams to cross sell. Starting in the first quarter, now that we have identified a primary owner within each account, some from the legacy Dell, some from the legacy Perot side, whoever had the deepest and best relationship, those people are going to have overall responsibility from a comp perspective and we are still working through the details. Really, we are going to finalize that this week but we will launch at the beginning of the year.  The other question around training was we've had two basic kinds of training throughout the organization -- one is a lot on just what is your new organization, what is the full range of capability so you can accurately represent that, and then the second has been getting into these integrated solution stacks and saying it's not just one plus one equals two. In many cases, there's a lot of new integration between the two activities that make for a very powerful solution. Understand how that works in some depth and that is where we get into very specialized training for the people who are responsible for that particular kind of solution.  Steve Schuckenbrock And Paul has done a lot to drive vertical orientation with this team throughout this year and so the healthcare and government space are already lined up around vertical solutions. In the large enterprise side, we've done a pretty massive overhaul of the way we structure our sales organization, the way those sales teams go to market, and a reskilling of those teams both through training and replacement and so we've got that significantly underway. That will continue into next year and the entire orientation of that training and replacement approach is towards solution selling, which is not exclusively services -- it's hardware, software, and services to solve customers' problems.  Rob Williams  Great. Well, I think that's a good point to stop. Just referring to slide 28, we obviously covered a lot today and couldn’t get to everyone on the call so I want to make sure that everyone knows that Shep, Frank, and I will be available to answer questions and do additional follow-ups this week. In summary, we are now positioned as one of the top 10 global service providers. We are redefining services from a customer's perspective. We are well-positioned in key verticals with compelling growth trends and this combination is both strategically important to Dell and financially accretive. Thanks for joining us.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator (Operator Instructions)  Toni Sacconaghi, Sanford Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein I have a question and a follow-up, please. Can you detail what's in the $300 million in acquisition related expenses? And ultimately how many people do you believe will be coming out as a result of the acquisition? The rough rule of thumb is typically that it might cost $50,000 to eliminate a position, which would suggest 6,000 people, which I don’t think is the case here. So I'm trying to understand what comprises the $300 million in acquisition related expenses.  Brian Gladden As we've said, this acquisition is not your typical cost focused integration activity here. I mean, I think we are looking at the consolidation of our IT infrastructure as really being the biggest driver of the synergy dollars. When you look at headcount actions and how we are thinking about that, there are some actions probably around G&A as we look at that and that that would be -- to be expected. We will be investing to add resources really around many of these growth and revenue programs that the team talked about.  When you look at the costs that are specified here in the details, I mean, they are one-time costs related to option accelerations and some small pieces related to severance and then there are costs related to getting our systems working together and getting the processes in place across the business in order for this to function effectively as a consolidated services business.  Peter Altabef I'll just add to that -- the internal Dell IT staff had some world-class people in it and one of the things that will happen to this -- through this acquisition is the ability to take those people who have done remarkably industry-leading services such as on server virtualization where Dell is one of the world leaders in virtualizing its own back office, taking those skills and bringing them to bear on client engagement.  So in addition to becoming more efficient internally, we are going to try to bring some of that experience and enhance our customer-facing [inaudible].  Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein Okay, thank you. And just a follow-up if I try and synthesize your comments on puts and takes on non-GAAP income for fiscal year 2011, you are essentially saying if we assume Perot has the incremental revenue growth synergies that we might expect $160 million to $200 million in non-GAAP income from Perot, you are going to get an incremental $100 million in cost synergies, so that's $300 million. And then Dell should get about $160 million less amortization of intangibles from standalone Dell so as we bridge GAAP to non-GAAP for next year, we should be thinking about roughly $450 million delta associated with that migration and including Perot -- is that the right way to think about it? Brian Gladden I think that math works. I think you are right on.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Bailey with Goldman Sachs. David Bailey - Goldman Sachs Could you talk a little bit about how you are thinking about the incremental investment that you are going to need to make to grow the services business, and how that compares to the savings that you outlined on slide 21? Brian Gladden I think as we go through the revenue synergies and the top line opportunities that were on page 20, that is where we think about investing and we have spent time really actually over the last couple of days as we start looking into even fiscal year 11 budgeting process, really debating where those opportunities might be to more aggressively invest in capacity, whether that's services delivery capacity, whether that is selling capacity, or whatever else we need to accelerate the growth here, even beyond these revenue synergies that we talk about on page 20.  So we have sort of isolated that investment and had that discussion based on ROI as it competes with other programs across Dell. The investment required to get at the cost reductions on page 21 is really kind of baked into the plan and that's -- that we have pretty good line of sight to what that is going to require. So I think there's two levels of investment that you will see.  David Bailey - Goldman Sachs  So any investment that you make will offset the cost synergies that you are talking about? Brian Gladden Well, maybe not necessarily -- I mean, we may invest in OpEx around the selling team to support expanding geographic footprint for Perot. That may be an OpEx investment we choose to do that's pretty much independent of anything we have shown you here.  David Bailey - Goldman Sachs I'm just trying to find out if that's a net or a gross number, so it sounds like that's the savings and then any incremental investment will offset some of that? Brian Gladden Yeah, I think that's right.  David Bailey - Goldman Sachs Thank you.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal I wanted to ask a question related to slide 20, specifically on the medium and longer term expansion or revenue growth enhancement opportunities, when you are getting into large enterprise, it's a fragmented market but very competitive. It's not obvious that Perot's or Dell is going to capture share -- how do you anticipate grabbing share there? And Brian, if you could talk a little bit about you've made it pretty clear that you are open to, or intend to do future acquisitions but how does this longer, medium and longer term opportunity relate to what you have in place today versus what you would look to in terms of your acquisition strategy. Thanks.  Steve Schuckenbrock I'll take the large enterprise in terms of capturing share in the services space specifically -- one, we've got a pretty good base to start with and number two is that our account teams on the Dell side have a phenomenal relationships with tens of thousands of customers across the globe.  Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal Excuse me for interrupting, but a lot of that is on the client side and I'm just not sure that translates into capturing enterprise wins with the larger organizations.  Steve Schuckenbrock That's actually not accurate that it's all on the client side. We have a terrific number of relationships on the enterprise side and in fact, are growing faster than the market in the enterprise side each and every quarter and so we feel terrific about the solutions we have in the data center, inclusive of our storage solutions, so that is just not accurate. And our ability to translate those relationships to broader services is already something that is proving itself out in all of the dialogs we are having with the customers.  So from my perspective, our ability to take a $16 billion enterprise business and continue to expand it with these new capabilities that we have just acquired is pretty straightforward exercise and it's about the execution of our sales teams.  Peter Altabef I would add to that -- if you look at the traditional, the Perot Systems legacy client relationships as well, we have had a very positive reaction to those -- that client base being interested in some of the services type activities that Dell has traditionally provided. So when you look at things like pro support and pro manage and all of the close to the client or close to the box support services that Dell has a very substantial business in, we are finding real interest among the Perot Systems clients, many of whom are large enterprise in that work as well. So I think that cross-selling opportunity generally and genuinely is going both ways.  Brian Gladden With regard to the acquisitions, I mean, as you look at some of the longer term opportunities here, geographic expansion is one of the biggest and as you know, the base Perot business was 85% of the business was in the U.S. As you look at our footprint outside the U.S., about 50% of Dell's revenues have come from outside the U.S., so a terrific opportunity organically to grow there but building out capability whether it's solution selling or whether it's consulting or whether it's actually services capacity to support European business or activity in APJ would be very logical opportunities and the Bering Point acquisition is a good example in China.  Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal And Brian, any sense on when you would be comfortable even from the fact of either cash balances or you are adding about 30% new headcount to combined Dell, when would you feel comfortable that this integration is done and therefore be willing to look at other acquisitions? And then I'll cede the floor. Thank you.  Brian Gladden I think it depends on the size and it depends on -- you know, the process is going well and I wouldn’t say that the cash balances are constrained at this point. We've still got $10 billion of cash. So it's a matter of really -- you know, we're talking about other targets right now and it's just a matter of finding something that makes sense and our ability to digest, which again that would depend on where the acquisition is. If it's in the services space, we can digest small things right now. If it's in other spaces around the enterprise, we can probably do something a little bit bigger.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup. Richard Gardner - Citigroup I am not sure if my memory is correct on this but I think at the time of the acquisition, you were actually talking about $800 million to $1 billion in shared costs in areas where there was overlap between Perot activities and Dell activities. And today you are talking about $300 million in combined cost reductions.  So I guess question number one is have you gone back and reassessed that $800 million to $1 billion in overlap areas? Or are you just being conservative on your synergy assumptions?  And then I guess number two is more of a statement -- I think in general most people today would say that you are probably a little bit more aggressive on your revenue synergy targets and a little less aggressive on your cost synergy targets than we might have expected, so maybe you could comment on that as well.  Brian Gladden I think we've been pretty clear that this was an acquisition about gaining capacity and a platform for growth, so the fact that we are more aggressive on our revenue synergies I think is exactly consistent with that message. That's what we talked about with the board and that's what we are doing.  The second, or the first part of your question we talked about the fact that we've asked Perot to basically run all of the Dell Services business. So the integration activity is really consolidating our existing Dell Services business with Peter's Perot Systems business that ultimately becomes a $7.5 billion business with over $4 billion of costs that we are attacking here. So when we talked about finding $300 million even an announcement we were talking about $300 million out of a $4 billion opportunity and that's why I think that's achievable and again, we are leaning on the growth is really the primary focus of our energy.  Unidentified Participant It goes right back to Perot's business was a very well-run business at time of acquisition and so the disciplines that they bring to growth are fundamental to our growth strategy going forward as we bring those same kind of operational controls and decision processes to the growth strategies that Paul and I will pursue. And as the teams are coming together, what we are seeing is the need to invest in resources based on this demand and so Paul -- Peter's comments a few minutes ago relative to repurposing some of the IT team to those opportunities is a great example of the fact that we have the opportunity to take bases of our cost structure and remission them towards our growth strategies and we are in the process of doing that and we see, as Brian said, that growth is if anything where we feel we have great upside.  Richard Gardner - Citigroup So I guess the right way to think about it is that the difference between the $300 million you are talking about today and the $800 million to $1 billion of overlap is reinvestment back into the growth strategy.  Rob Williams  I'm not really sure where the $800 million to $1 billion came from. We've always been a $4 billion in share costs, so we'll take this offline and cover it after the call.  Richard Gardner - Citigroup Okay. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley Have you seen examples of revenue synergies from cross-selling in the first 43 days? If so, where have you found the low-hanging fruit and if not, how long do you think it takes for that revenue upside to show up? And then I have a quick follow-up.  Peter Altabef That's a great question. One of the things that I think everyone on this call is seeing is the speed with which this transaction is moving forward with the -- even the announcement on September 21st, we closed the transaction on November 3rd. On November 3rd, we had Dell services formed, so the 42,000 people were actually all in one organization the day of or within 24 hours after the actual confirmation of the merger.  On November 3rd, we provided to the sales teams what we called a quick start manual, which provided a -- not only a commission plan for new synergy opportunities but also a how-to manual. We gave it to both sales teams from the legacy Perot as well as the Dell legacy teams.  So far, that has resulted in 88 new pursuits that we are now monitoring and tracking as incremental additional pursuits. And as Steve mentioned, some of those have already brought to bear and we have closed. So an example of one of those would be for a manufacturing company that was a traditional Dell client on the hardware side that needed work in SAP, consulting, and implementation. And we were able to bring in the Perot legacy SAP consulting and implementation team and start providing those services. That transaction closed in terms of the contract about 10 days ago. Actually, less than 10 days ago.  So there will be some of these very, very fast two weeks sales cycle opportunities, most of them obviously will take more than two weeks but we think we are getting immediate traction both on the large enterprise and in the public sector in Paul Bell's world as well, and that 88 opportunities covers opportunities both in healthcare, in some government, as well as in the large enterprise and the medium business area.  Unidentified Participant That's a great example, Peter, of the question before of how are we going to gain share.

With this, I would like to hand over to Peer Schatz. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Yes thank you Solveigh and thanks for joining QIAGEN's third quarter 2007 conference call. We had a very strong performance in this third quarter 2007. Revenues came in at a $176.6 million, EPS on adjusted basis at $0.17. Net income on an adjusted basis grew 42% and the strong performance in this third quarter 2007 allows us to increase full year 2007 EPS adjusted guidance. Overall revenue growth, as I said was every strong. We grew 50%, significantly advancing our leadership positions almost all across the board. Strong organic growth rate, underlying the overall growth rate has been very strong again, continuing a very strong performance in our sample and assay technology core areas. We believe we increased market leadership and share in all markets we serve. At the core of this success is and continues to be QIAGEN's success in innovating. Once again, 4% of sales come from products we launched within the trailing 12 months. This continues to be a record for our industry and we're actually facing one of the strongest pipelines ever looking into 2008. The Digene integration is running very well. It is fully on track, all major projects have been started; some have actually already been completed, I have more details on that in a slide a little bit later. So many good things happened in this third quarter 2007, on top of that and what certainly captured a lot of headlines were landmark studies which were published demonstrating the value of HPV testing, including such value as a primary screen, and this is clearly very important as we are rolling out this product into many markets that do not have established testing regimes yet. So overall, both operationally, financially, but also strategically a very strong performance in this third quarter, we exceeded our targets and we are looking very confidently into 2008. Turning to slide number 4, the typical distribution of our revenues, as we shown in previous conference calls, didn't really change materially. 90% of our sales continued to come from consumables, and about 10% from instrumentation. We saw a very strong growth across the board in our consumable space, or sample and assay technologies consumables 45% growth rate on a constant exchange rate basis. Clearly, this includes acquired revenues and I will get through the breakdown in a minute. But in instrumentation, which also was about the same share of the legacy Digene business which is now consolidated, continue to show a very strong growth rate and we are very satisfied with that business area as well. As we all know these two products, instrumentation and consumables go hand in hand and are used very often as a package which operate together. If we look at the geographic regions on the right hand side, we see continued very growth in Europe, North America slightly under that growth, but also a good performance and Asia continues to grow very rapidly. But it is important to say here while the overall growth rate in Asia is under that of the second quarter the growth rate in Asia continues to be very strong, there many countries are continuing to grow at very high growth rates. Japan is in there which is growing in the single-digits but the most important factor was the second quarter included acquired revenues which increased that growth rate, so we continue to see on an organic basis a very strong performance in the Asian countries and we are very excited about our leadership position which we actually have in many markets and which we are actually expanding every day. On slide number 5, you see the typical breakdown of revenues that we always show and shows you that we continue to show a very solid and very strong organic growth rate of about 10% and this organic growth rate comes from a 2% price increase, 4% volume increase and 4% increase from new product i.e. innovation. This is a very comparable number to what we have seen in previous quarters and continues to demonstrate the strength of our innovation and of our operating franchise. On top of that 35% of our revenues came from acquisitions; exchange rates added another 5%... to an overall 50%, overall revenue growth rate. Turning to slide number 6, I just wanted to give you a small glimpse into our integration process. Now what is important to note here is that our molecular diagnostics business pre-merger was about the same size as the Digene business pre-merger. The two are coming together. The majority of our revenues, our... the pre-merger revenues are actually hardly involved with disintegration process. It is more of the administrative and the directly associated marketing and sales activities, directly associated with the molecular diagnostics business. I will give you an example in a minute. The disintegration is going very well. Its especially going very fast more than 80 integration projects were defined and they were defined in record time early September. We actually rolled out the organization at that time as well and all employees have received their project descriptions or their job descriptions at that point in time. Approximately 525 high level project milestones were identified and we actually completed already our 25% of those as of today. We clearly went into an in-depth review of the synergy targets that we had estimated when we came out and announced the acquisition early June, and we can hereby confirm that we feel very confident with the synergy targets. Most importantly the revenue synergy targets coming from collapsing the sales forces and also... and especially new product which is an extremely exciting area for us that we see accelerating significantly, especially in 2009 as we're finalizing these developments over the course of 2008. On top of that, the cost synergies that we estimated at $35 million to $45 million in 2008, we can hereby reaffirm, we feel very comfortable with that number. Out of these $35 million to $45 million in cost savings about 10% to 15% of those are coming from the cost of sales areas, the manufacturing areas that are leveraging manufacturing capacities that are also sharing infrastructures and overhead. And this is clearly one area that will continue to... place continued emphasis ongoing forward. The cost energies and the R&D area are a little bit misleading. We are actually expanding our R&D efforts and the pipeline is extremely promising and very full in the area of women's health, but also overall for our company. What we are seeing here is cost synergies are primarily the sharing of resources and infrastructures and also overhead. At the same time what we are also seeing here is that we're able to collapse a number of QIAGEN related products, pre-merger QIAGEN related product into projects that pre-merger Digene was about to address. And this is leading to significant cost synergies. And also here we will give some... shed some light on this pipeline in our analyst day in February. It is an extremely exciting pipeline around the area of women's health but also overall in the company. And we much look forward to sharing that with you. In the sales and marketing area, we see significant synergies as we're collapsing our molecular diagnostic sales force as I have some details on that in a minute. And especially as the legacy Digene business case had an expansion of the sales force we can generate a lot of synergies there. In the G&A area the cost synergies are primarily in the area of corporate infrastructure and also IT and therefore the largest area of... in terms of dollars largest area of synergies. The integration is fully on track. We feel it is very well managed and we are very much looking forward to building on this going forward. Just one example how, because we are getting this question from time to time, how we are going about our sales force or integrating our sales forces. On slide number 7, you see how the legacy QIAGEN business actually sold. We had in the legacy QIAGEN business one of the largest sales forces in the world if not the largest molecular diagnostics about a 150 professionals globally selling over 500 different products directly through laboratories. These are the same customers that are also purchasing the HPD related products and others in the area of women's health. If we now move to the next slide, slide 8 we have a description of the pre-merger Digene business. For laboratory sales force which you see on the bottom on slide 8 was actually substantially smaller than the QIAGEN laboratory sales force. So, the legacy Digene only had 20 sales people going into laboratories and actually focused on selling and creating solution packages over the laboratory themselves. The majority of those sales force was in the area of so called clinician sales force about 80 people and on top of that the quite innovative marketing program the direct to consumer advertising. If we move to slide 9, you see how we are going to collapse this. It's actually quite simple. We will continue and actually expand the direct to consumer advertising programs. We're also rolling these out internationally, into countries that are open to this type of advertising. On top of that we're keeping and actually expanding going forward the clinical sales force that is focusing on educating physicians about HPD and how to take samples and how to send them on to laboratories. This is an area that is extremely important as we're still seeing low penetration rates. Even in the United States the education of physicians is absolutely critical. On top of that our laboratory sales force just got even larger, at 170 professionals we are clearly a very formidable force globally, working with laboratories on complete solution packages creating an opportunity for laboratories to also interact with professionals who really understand molecular diagnostics and have an unrivaled breadth in product and solutions in this space. This is a very important area for us and we're going to continue to focus on that going forward as well So a very strong sales channel and one that we will also replicate in similar formats and actually did so in many instances already in other countries around the world. On slide 10 just one word on our franchise, very often it's a... I see various efforts to try to put us into one or the other bucket as there are a number of sub-segments of the molecular diagnostics space. What's actually so exciting about QIAGEN is that we are present in almost every sub-segment of molecular diagnostics. We have two, our open platform technologies at present which starts in very early adopter segments as they're using our open platforms and developing tests for these, for noble targets we are present in an extremely exciting way allowing us to be one of the most often cited companies in journals such as Journal of Molecular Diagnostics and others. On top of that we have a closed assay portfolio which is one of the broadest in the world. We have today about a 120 tests that we sell throughout the world in various countries in different formats that address very many different sub-segments of molecular diagnostics. These certainly include the areas of viral and non-viral infectious diseases. There are also genetic diseases in pharmacogenetics and in oncology we have a very fascinating pipeline around HPV but also one that we are significantly focused on to expand going forward. In blood screening, we are typically working through partners and in many countries of the world we actually have a direct sale of closed assays into blood screening but predominantly in Asia. So, a very leading player at the same time a very broad footprint in this early market allowing us to address a lot of opportunities going forward. And this leads me to slide 11, also here platform strategies are often being discussed and very often around a specific type of platform. Well we think a customer thinks beyond that. He is not interested in buying of oxygen, he is interested in buying a solution. And we today have an extremely broad platform of strategy that is around very high throughput technologies that are for instance the Rapid Capture System but also others. We sell into open real time PCR platforms that are today almost ubiquitous standards in almost any molecular diagnostic laboratories so most of our assays are actually regulated for use on multiple different sites for us in many countries of the world and here again we have a leading portfolio of tests. We also have these novel multiplex technologies that we're detecting on Luminex system that are also very strong standard in the market and also added now the Genetic Analyzer the eGene system that we will formally be rolling out in 2008. That gives us a really exciting product for many sub-segments of molecular diagnostic as well, and I can tell you that this area will increase going forward. It's an area of heavy focus above and it's certainly not the same... you will not have the same chart in a few years. The assay offering continues to be very broad and is expanding actually every day. We are using clearly this breadth to give solutions to our customers across many different types of targets that potentially... there are hardly any other solutions for. We are there to provide these and clearly this is now also boosted by the blockbuster franchises around HPV, and in HPV we have significant expansion of the product offering that we will shed light on in February 2008. We did already say that HPV genotyping went on fast track as well the CF assay and respiratory and hospital-acquired infections should come out in 2008 as well. All on these novel multiplex technologies that we are getting fantastic results on, first products have been launched into the research use only market. Now, just a few words on these HPV studies. There have been a number of studies that came out over the last few years, and what is really very exciting is that they are using our product, our technologies here to demonstrate the value of HPV testing. HPV testing is an area... it's actually easy to detect an HPV virus. It's a very difficult, so the analytical sensitivity of a test is very easy to achieve. The clinical sensitivity is very difficult to achieve. And this is like... these broad studies are extremely important and the study that came out and was established in the New England Journal of Medicine a few weeks ago was just extremely positive for us and clearly we'll pick up with Frontline News, our news in USA Today and many other newspapers and journals throughout the world continues to show the importance of what we do. On slide 14, just some key findings of these, HPV consistently is more sensitive and psychology. HPV DNA detect lesions earlier than psychology. It's a better predictor of risk for older women. Follow-up of HPV positive side of normal women with genotyping, psychology improves specificity. And LBC does not detect more high-grades squamous intraepithelial lesions and will not be recommended. This is a study performed in Italy that concluded that. HPV testing is safe and likely cost effective and there are studies that drill deeper into the significant cost effectiveness of HPV even as the primary screen and the extended interval is a benefit for women on lower cost for the health care system overall. Self sampling is one area that is increasingly also looked at. So HPV as a frontline primary screen is really the next logical step and these studies come at a very important time and the decision periods in which many countries are in terms of cervical cancer screening programs. Just to close my part of the presentation on slide 15, we get some questions on our geographic presence as well. We have three main sites, the site in Maryland is now significantly expanded the two sites are being merged. And we actually have teams moving back and forth between these sites. This is the fantastic opportunity to accelerate integration and also to combine and concentrate our efforts in certain functional areas. Our site in Germany is also expanding and also our site in China is expanding, and we actually received a very important and very rare still medical device manufacturing enterprise license from the FFTA [ph], making us one of very few diagnostic manufacturers who have received this seal of approval from that authority. With that, I'll hand over to Roland. Roland Sackers - Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Peer and good afternoon everyone in Europe and good morning to those joining from the U.S. I believe our numbers this quarter are a testament to the strong strategic and operational highlights that Peer just outlined for you already. Our leadership in molecular diagnostics is boosted by a deep pipeline of technology opportunities and allows cost and sales synergies. This is superior growth profile and double-digit organic growth. We feel we are well on track going into the first quarter and on a solid footing for attaining our goals for the fiscal year 2007, therefore the increase in our fiscal year 2007 guidance. So taking a closer look now at our third quarter results on slide 17. We are pleased with this outcome as we exceeded our financial goals. We reported revenues of $176.6 million U.S., which are up by 50% over the same period last year. Our sales of HPV testing product are recorded in our sales to customers transforming molecular diagnostics. These sales continue to gain momentum, exceeding our expectations and further reinforcing our position as a market leader. They exceeded our targets for such HPV related sales in the third quarter and remain confident in our ability to grow our HPV testing business between $58 million to $60 million U.S. in the first quarter and further accelerating this business to $260 million to $270 million U.S. for calendar 2008, as we have guided before. As you may know, it is our policy not to break out individual products or business from past acquisition and our approach is to show consolidated figures which incorporate the revenue from Digene and to HPV tests. This policy is also reflective of how we conduct our business, where HPV is a part of an integrated molecular diagnostics strategy. We saw a 3% foreign currency impact on revenues comparing the actual results for the guidance spread from January 31st 2007. Perceived adjusted operating income of $43.7 million U.S., an increase of 43% over the same period of 2006 is margin of 25%. Although this is still to quite solid we are not yet fully yet leveraged cost synergies. So we expect further operating margin level improvement in 2008 on this basis. To increase comparability and to show underlying performance, we exclude from these adjusted figures any acquisition integration and relocation related charges, as well as the amortization of acquired IP and equity based compensation. Of course, we also report our financials including all such charges and costs as well. Adjusted net income was $31.1 million U.S. for the quarter, demonstrating growth of 42% over the third quarter 2006. Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.17, as share lies above what we expected. Included in this is a tax benefit of $0.02 which resulted from prior year tax credit as well as a positive impact relating to FIN 48. Turning to a breakdown by product line for the third quarter 2007. Just for some additional clarification ahead of this on how we have allocated the various newly acquired products. The consumable line includes sales from all molecular diagnostic assays including HPV tests and under instruments, we include all instruments related to molecular diagnostics, including instruments related to HPV testing. We had strong growth both in consumables and instruments this quarter. We delivered 45% growth on a currency exchange rate basis in consumables and 39% growth in instruments. I think these numbers are a signal that we are leveraging not only our improved sales management, particularly well in instruments, but it is also true for our consumables in terms of integration progress. Also in both sample and assay technology was solid in all market segments and across all product lines. We had an innovation rate of approximately 4% based on revenues coming from products and sample and assay technologies in areas including the gene expression, microRNA, proteomics and molecular diagnostics launched in the last 12 months. In terms of the category others, the numbers are effectively immaterial, but we show them here for the sake of completeness. On the next slide we show our reported versus adjusted figures. As a reminder we provide non-GAAP figure financial measures because we believe it provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our core results and provide for consistency and financial reporting. First, our net sales were same under both GAAP and non-U.S.GAAP. I like to break down operating income a bit more for you. This was adjusted mainly for in-process R&D amounting to $25.9 million, comprised of $25 million from Digene, 900,000 from eGene. Acquisition and integration related costs amounted to $5.9 billion. Also included in these adjustments are acquisition-related intangible amortization of $11.4 million and FAS 123R expenses of $2.2 million. To put this in another perspective, excluding these integration expenses, we showed significant profitability on operating income, net income and EPS. There is an adjusted 18% after tax profitability. You will find the details split out in our Appendices to this presentation of these figures. Of all the third quarter numbers breakdown as follows. We once again reported strong top line growth. Our net sales of $176.6 million, this was compared to $117.9 million for the same period in 2006, reflects a growth rate of 50%. Looking at our numbers on an adjusted basis, our gross margin was 71% for the third quarter. To give you a bit more detail on these numbers, first of all Digene was consolidated only for two months, not for three months. For next quarter, we would see a slight increase here. Secondly, the legacy Digene typically included licenses outside of cost of sales, the operational expenses whereas at QIAGEN we typically include this in the cost of sales. Finally, there were also other reclassifications between operational expenses and cost of sales. So overall, on a standalone basis, the gross profit is slightly lower than Digene reported before, nevertheless, we expect for the fourth quarter an improvement in gross margin. Our adjusted operating income demonstrated approximately 43% growth over the third quarter 2006. Our adjusted net income showed a strong growth rate of 42%, however, our tax rate is also lower rather for third quarter 2006, including the tax benefit as mentioned before. Our normalized tax rate was around 30%. Additional factors that continue to contribute to a lower tax rate are also the revenue share in Asia as well as Switzerland as it pertains to our instrument business and favorable tax benefit from the recent $500 million credit facility. In respect of adjusted diluted earnings per share we had an increase of 21% to $0.17 per share up from $0.14 for this comparable quarter in 2006. And that's also our expectation for the third quarter 2007. I will not go into any great detail on our nine months numbers at this point. You will find the detailed breakdown on slide 33 in our appendices of these. I would like to highlight however that our first nine months revenues for 2007 were $439 million using guidance rate that would be $432 million and with an adjusted EPS of $0.48 which is up 20% over the first nine months in 2006. Based on our strong performance in the third quarter, we are increasing our full year guidance for adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03 from the previously announced $0.55 to $0.59 to $0.61 to $0.62. For fiscal year 2007, we continue to forecast revenues to be in the range $614 million to $635 million using the guidance rate. We believe that both eGene and Digene expected contribution to this remains well on track as previously stated. From our HPV testing business for instance that is $58 million to $60 million. For adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter, we expect $0.13 to $0.14. Just to point out to you some of the effect of contributing EPS estimate also having made significant progress on the integration front we still have some way to go on achieving operational leverage and the necessary efficiencies. In addition, direct advertising and regulatory costs also have an impact. On the next slide we've listed a number of assumptions to frame some of the items more precisely for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2007. First of all our organic growth, we continue to look for approximately 10% here. Digene and eGene are not organic of course. On adjustment, operating income for the fourth quarter, including the Digene and eGene acquisition, you should expect the following. FAS 123R expenses between $4 million and $4.5 million driven mainly by the legacy Digene equity-based compensation plan. Amortization of acquired IP of approximately $15 million which will not all be seen in the operating line, was approximately 78% in the cost of goods sold line. Integration and acquisition-related charges of approximately $3.5 million to $4 million. The overall pro forma tax rate for the fourth quarter is expected to be between 26% and 30% and the weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding will be around 205 million shares for the fourth quarter and around 175 million to 180 million shares for the full year 2007. Before I hand back to Peer, I would like to go ahead and give you some assumptions for 2008. In terms of adjustment, operating income for 2008, you should expect 123R expenses between $15 million and $17 million. This is including the legacy Digene equity-based compensation plan. Amortization of acquired IP of approximately $60 million and again here this will not all be seen in the operating line, was approximately 78% of this in the cost of goods sold line. Integration and acquisition related charges of approximately $12 million to $50 million. This will be spread over all four quarters next year by tapering off as the end of Q4. As most of you know we have significant operating activities in Europe, primarily in Germany. Due to a tax reform in Germany we expect a significant positive decrease of our corporate tax rate down to 26% to 30% for the year 2008. We would use additional profit out of a decrease in tax rate to boost our research spending and sales channel activities without any impact on our EPS number. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding will be around 210 million shares. For a detailed breakdown of amortization please refer to slide 31. With that I would like to hand over to Peer. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Thanks Roland. So overall here on slide 24 is summary, as very strong third quarter, well on track, revenues up 50%, organic growth of 10% and a strong first nine months. But very important here is strong strategic momentum. We are seeing a very exciting market environment across the board. In our molecular diagnostic business HPV testing is getting more and more accepted also even outside the United States and we are very well positioned to take also the instrument [ph] business going forward. As integration of our acquired businesses is very well on track and we look forward to moving on this project very actively now over the next three months. The guidance for the full year 2007 as given by Roland before $614 million to $635 million on the top line and $0.61 to $0.62 which represents an increase of about $0.03 compared to the previous guidance. So overall a very strong performance and we are looking at very positively into 2008. And last but not least on slide 25, I would like to introduce you to somebody here in new on our QIAGEN team. I know a lot of you know how Al Leury very well. Al has been with Digene for seven years in Investor Relations and other related functions. He brings to... he will be joining our Investor Relations team and this is a great addition to our team. And he has such a strong academic background in both science and finance, a BS in biology and a bachelor's degree in economics and also he's a graduate from Warton with an MBA. His contact information is here on the slide, and he will be the contact before all... investors are increased in the United States if you like to move to this channel. And we look forward also to introducing him and to you in person going forward for those who have not yet met him. With that, I would like to hand back to Solveigh. Dr. Solveigh Mahler - Director of Investor Relations Thank you very much Peer. We are now looking forward to taking your questions. To open the Q&A session I would like to hand over to the operator, Alpha. Question And Answer Operator Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. William Quirk - Piper Jaffray Thank you and good morning or good afternoon. I suppose in terms of your perspective. First question here I know you don't like to break out the Digene contribution by geography but it looks like the European business actually continues to grow in excess of the U.S, is our math correct here? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Well it certainly is coming from a much smaller number and clearly we are seeing effects of these tests rolling out in certain countries leveraging our sales infrastructure. So maybe first overall we gave certain number targets for the third quarter and we came well within those or actually exceeded those targets for the HPV related business. The international mix is one that I wouldn't want to break out at this point in time. I would say however molecular diagnostics business in Europe had a very strong quarter in the third quarter. William Quirk - Piper Jaffray Excellent, thank you. Second question actually has to do with the pipeline and in particularly the hospital-acquired infection launched, good to hear that this is tied up for 2008. But I was hoping Peer I know you don't want to give too many details away until the analyst day but perhaps you could help us think a little bit about the launch timing, is this beginning of '08, kind of end of '08 and should we assume that this is going to include more than an MRSA assay that we are looking at more of a panel approach? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Well first to the latter question, the profile of the assay, our QIAplex technology allows us to put a lot of real estate onto a panel, so with very high sensitivity we can hit many targets within a given sample and this is a benefit that we want to bring to our customers. So we're re not thinking about an MRSA assay and then here and then VRE assay there or then the third assay there, we are thinking of creating panels that in one shot and in very powerful way can give a very high resolution of the various targets and also a sub-typing of them as well. This is the benefit of the QIAplex technology and also one of the advantages of first preliminary version we launched for researchers only in Q2. Now in terms of the launch outline, we did put some of the women's health related assays on fast track and the hospital acquired infections panel will be more in a regulated format, will be more in the second half of 2008 than the first. William Quirk - Piper Jaffray Thank you very much. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jason Weiss from Robert W. Baird, please go ahead. Jason Weiss - Robert W. Baird Hi thanks for taking my call. I am wondering if you could talk little bit about perhaps some HPV contract wins that you have seen either within or outside the U.S.? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Sure, while we continue to expand our business and there were some major contracts signed in the second and the third quarter, one that was announced was certainly the expansion of our contract with Quest and we continue to see that our customers are extremely favorable to this tremendous body of data that we can bring to the table, that shows the value of these tests. And we are winning contracts almost every day or every week. So as this expands geographically, I wouldn't want to comment on individual contract, unless they're really material, but we are seeing a very strong competitive advantage for the technology and the competitive advantages of our product. Jason Weiss - Robert W. Baird Great, thank you for that. Then with regard to gross margin, you gave some good insight as to some of the moving pieces there. I am wondering if you could provide any additional detail on the gross margin of the core QIAGEN business during Q3. Roland Sackers - Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer On our core QIAGEN... hi Jason, I think we have a growth... we have seen I think good quarter. We have clearly had a strong instrument quarter as well which as you know clearly has an impact on gross margin, but as I said before, it doesn't have any impact on operational income and on EPS as we benefit some on the tax side. So overall I would say a slight improvement on the call it legacy QIAGEN gross margin, but I think a big impact was really that we... for accounting purposes where we had some reclassification between legacy QIAGEN and QIAGEN accounting policies. And therefore you will see a... you have seen a slight impact in the third quarter, but of course as I said, you will see an improvement already going into the fourth quarter, of course having three months of QIAGEN within our consolidation, certainly has impacted growth. Jason Weiss - Robert W. Baird Great, thank you. Roland. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Maykin Ho with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Maykin Ho - Goldman Sachs Hi. I don't know whether I missed this. I think in the past you've broken down your business based on research, molecular diagnostics etcetera. So what is the breakdown for this quarter? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Yes thanks Maykin. Well the breakdown is a little bit difficult and misleading, because we didn't have a full quarter. On an apples of the Digene business being consolidated here, I would take as the best basis the numbers that we put out in the second quarter in which the molecular diagnostic business about 48% of our sales and you should consider that also as the target number for this quarter. But again we only consolidated two quarters of Digene and that's why this percentage number we thought of it, but it would have been little bit misleading if we put in. So no major changes, use the second quarter number the guidance for what we have in the third quarter, if that's okay. Maykin Ho - Goldman Sachs Sure. If I do a quick calculation here that's about $85 million in molecular diagnostics, granted this is only about two months of Digene. But if you do the calculation in second quarter molecular diagnostics is $65 million, for instance $20 million for the two months, is that the right way to think about that? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Roland. Roland Sackers - Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer Yes, I think if you do that on an apple-on-apple basis, you would probably see that for the third quarter... put it differently in the fourth quarter you will probably see that molecular diagnostics will be around 48% of total revenues, for the third quarter was around 42% because of the two months Digene consolidation. Maykin Ho - Goldman Sachs So if the math is correct then the two months is only $20 million? Roland Sackers - Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer No, that is something wrong with your math. Maykin Ho - Goldman Sachs Maybe incorrect? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee We guided for numbers around $40 million in HPV related business and as I said before, we were well in or exceeded that number. Maykin Ho - Goldman Sachs Okay, thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Leonard of First Analysis, please go ahead. Dan Leonard - First Analysis Good afternoon. Peer on the hospital acquired infection panel, could you give me some insight into how a multi-target panel like that may be reimbursed? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Yes we have some interesting ideas in this space. I'd say it's a excellent question Dan and that one which is very important. If I may, I would like to keep that little bit under lid and try to give you little bit detail on that in February. But we see this is actually an extremely important opportunity because it could also significantly lead to a cost reduction in the system and as we're seeing the need for broader based analytical, broad based testing. Dan Leonard - First Analysis Okay thanks. And then my second question, can you give me an update on the progress of your HPV patent litigation? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Yes, sure. Well we really don't comment on ongoing litigations, and I know lot of other people who have been doing that and the information has all been a little bit misleading. Maybe for instance say that QIAGEN has the most extensive HPV intellectual property positioning in the world, and we remain extremely committed to enforcing this position. But in terms of specifics, we do not as a policy comment on any pending litigation and ongoing litigation. And this IP portfolio is only one of very many significant barriers to entry in the HPV testing market. And again, I see a lot of data around HPV testing where analytical performances are being looked at. What is important is the clinical performance and this is where, probably the most significant barrier kicks in. And we have a, however, a very clear position that we will defend our IP positions very actively going forward and nothing has changed on that. We are looking forward. Our strategy is very straightforward and we are moving full steam on it. Dan Leonard - First Analysis Okay. Thank you. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Eric Criscuolo [ph] with Thomas Weisel Partners, please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst Hi thank you for taking my questions filling in for Peter Lawson here. I was just wondering, can you comment on what the organic growth for your instruments were at this quarter? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Well Ronald, do want to take that? Roland Sackers - Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer Absolutely, I think the organic growth was around 10% and I think there was not such significant difference, maybe just looking on the details here between consumables and instruments, so both are around approximately 10%. Unidentified Analyst Okay, 10% great thanks. And also as far as the sales force integration is going, can you maybe comment on what maybe your biggest concern is, regarding the integration on maybe what you could possibly see as a hurdle that you have to overcome for that to go smoothly? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Well I think whichever integration, the most important thing is the people behind the companies and the organizations that are coming together and are working as one. And we are placing a significant emphasis on integrating the cultures and also the people. And this has been very successful especially on the last... about the last six weeks since we were able to announce the organizations and the roles and responsibilities. This is something that we are putting a very high emphasis on. In terms of the integration of the sales forces, we are actually getting a fantastic feedback from the sales teams. First of all the sales teams have a broad portfolio they can now talk about and also create very interesting discussions with the customers across the number of different products and at the same time our legacy sales force has a product at line which is extremely important for so many laboratories that they talk to. So that integration on the sales side will be completed by the end of this year, and we expect to operate under the new, under the new structures we saw it here starting in January. And it is different country by country, and that's really the challenge to balance the right mix between physician and laboratory sales force and then leverage everything with advocacy and DTC marketing which... this mix is almost in every country very different and finding that off to more mix is one thing that we're working very intensely on. Unidentified Analyst Okay great. Thank you very much. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Patrick Fuchs with DZ Bank, please go. Patrick Fuchs - DZ Bank Hello, I have a question regarding HPV testing in China as their cytology infrastructure is not so well developed than in western countries. So I still see... are you already seeing there picking up phase or what are your activities there? And will it be more obvious in let's say an HPV growth rate in 2008? Thank you. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Excellent question Patrick. China is as we know very important market for QIAGEN, we are market leader in molecular testing in China. And this is a market that is very open to HPV testing and especially to the solutions we have to offer. We have already been offering HPV tests, the legacy QIGEN business previously on a real time PCR basis but the legacy Digene technology is simply far superior in terms of the clinical validation and also the performance of the product. So we're getting great feedback on this, and the integration of our businesses in China is actually one which is at very high priority. What is very interesting in China is we have... there were announcements previously from the legacy Digene organization that they had a product in the pipeline that had been co-financed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that allows HPV testing to go into very rural settings. And this is certainly a product area that you'll hear more from going forward as we talk about rolling out HPV testing into developing countries linking HPV testing around the developed world versions with disseminatable solutions that we can use in rural setting. It's very important politically and something that we look forward to leveraging going forward. Patrick Fuchs - DZ Bank Thank you. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Scalo with Canaccord Adams, please go ahead. Matthew Scalo - Canaccord Adams Hi guys I just wanted a little bit of clarification here. Peer you mentioned, HPV $40 million was the expectation for the quarter. I have got in my note $36 million to $38 million I know I am splitting hairs here but you said you exceeded $40 million? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Okay. I was... sorry for the confusion here. We had given guidance for the third quarter of 36 to 38 and I said, we... I didn't give us... I said our guidance has been around 40 and we met or exceeded the guidance. So and so it's... the business is performing very well. Matthew Scalo - Canaccord Adams Okay. Thanks for that and then as far as Digene's DTC campaign in the U.S. can you comment a little bit about third quarter fourth quarter spend, possibly talk about do you anticipate continuing that in 2008 and then possibly do you anticipate doing a DTC campaign in Europe to kind of jumpstart back road there? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Sure good question. We had, we're currently analyzing our 2008 plan for DTC activity. So we continue to see this as an important factor and one that we want to use going forward as well. And the market is changing, there is increasingly awareness around HPV in general, the vaccines did their share, we can do our thing as a... we might be large as a diagnostic company but we are no match to the vaccine companies with their hundreds of millions of dollars of HPV awareness activity. And this is certainly something that we want to synchronize and leverage that more going forward. So we are looking at the 2008 plan but it will certainly be a very heavy emphasis also going forward. In Europe we have been using... we have been test driving DTC in various regions with some good success in some regions and it really depends on the local infrastructure on the reimbursement and these types of things. So also here this is part of an very important effort where we've put our very strong European infrastructure to work at optimizing the rollout of these products in 2008. Matthew Scalo - Canaccord Adams Okay, thank you guys. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alastair Mackay with GARP Research. Please go ahead. Alastair Mackay - GARP Research Hi good afternoon. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Hi Alastair. Alastair Mackay - GARP Research Digene has had previously disclosed that they were working on the genotyping assay which they have mentioned is HC4, can you give any insight as to whether you are pursuing the genotyping assay in HPV and whether or not we could use the Hybrid Capture Technology or perhaps whether you would migrate that assay over to another QIAGEN technology? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Sure Alastair, I think I wouldn't want to say yes or no now to your answer. Let me just tell you what we have said so far. We have a very exciting HPV genotyping product that we have on fast track and that will actually be launchable in the foreseeable future now. And this is a very powerful product that we'll be leveraging multiplexing technologies which we have some under the QIAplex technology name. These are PCR multiplexing technologies that can be detected on numerous different systems such as Luminex or others. At the same time, our innovation engine is put behind women's health in a broad way and also in the sub-segment of HPV testing in a very broad way. And we see that the market we will need many different solutions and we are committed to bring to our customers a number of different solutions in this space. And as the market leader and the technology leader we are taking this very seriously and we are going to be extremely innovative over the next few years, and also here I would like to defer some of your latter question regarding hybrid capture based genotyping to our analyst day in February. Alastair Mackay - GARP Research Very good thank you. And then for Roland, I had an arithmetic question. Roland if you could say how many shares in total QIAGEN issued in the third quarter for both eGene and Digene and any other similar activities? Roland Sackers - Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer For Digene was around 39 million shares and eGene was around a million share. Nothing else. Alastair Mackay - GARP Research Okay, thank you. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Peter Welford with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead. Peter Welford - Lehman Brothers Hi thanks for taking my question, as there is two actually firstly on the $500 million credit facility that Roland mentioned. I am just wondering whether you can give the outline the financial terms of that and whether how long that's in place for. Second question that is just on the tax and I appreciate that it will be very difficult to outline. But just the benefits you are clearly seeing in the midst, how should we think about this going forward beyond '08? And can I just also ask for a point of clarification which is just on the 4Q EPS guidance you gave? I just tried to do the math from your full year guidance and the number of shares you've got, I think you won't stand too low in the range because I... could you expand [ph] on, just to check back, that will great? Thank you. Roland Sackers - Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer Hi Peter, thanks for your question. On the credit facility, the debt component for Digene acquisition was financed, as I would see it as a very favorable terms at Deutsche Bank. [indiscernible] is the five year term at total interest rate of somewhere between 575, 6% and then we have additional $150 million on revolving credit facility, which gives us some flexibility going forward. On the tax, I think going forward I think especially in 2008 as of January 1st 2008, the German tax reform will come into power and as you know that we have significant or do significant step-up of our production and value generation in Germany where there is effective tax rate as small as coming down from 38% to 30%, which means overall we probably should have an effective tax rate for QIAGEN group somewhere between 26% and 30%. And I also think there is something which will be... we feel very confident in 2008 and beyond. And on EPS I think guidance is $0.61 to $0.62 and we had shifted $0.48 within the first nine months. Peter Welford - Lehman Brothers Okay, thank you. Roland Sackers - Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer You are welcome. Operator Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Peer Schatz. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Executive Committee Solveigh. Do you want to... Dr. Solveigh Mahler - Director of Investor Relations Yes okay, thank you very much. I would like to close this conference call by thanking you all for participating. We hope to welcome you again to our full year 2008 results conference call in February 2008. If you have any additional questions please do not hesitate to contact us. Again thank you very much and have a nice day. Thank you very much, bye. Operator Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference.

Welcome to the QIAGEN NV Investor and Analyst Conference Call on the Q2 Results 2011. Throughout today’s recorded presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Dr. Mähler, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma’am. Dr. Solveigh Mähler Yeah. Thank you very much, Jason; and hello, everybody. Welcome to QIAGEN’s second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. I am Solveigh Mähler, Director of Investor Relations at QIAGEN. With me on the call are QIAGEN’s CEO, Peer Schatz; and QIAGEN’s CFO, Roland Sackers. We issued a press release last night announcing QIAGEN’s financial results for the second quarter ending June 30, 2011, describing the Company’s recent business highlights. A copy of this announcement, as well as the presentation we will be using during this conference call can be downloaded from the Investor Relations section of our homepage at www.qiagen.com. This conference call will cover 30-minutes presentation followed by a Q&A session. The time of the conference call is set at one hour. We, therefore, would like to ask you to please limit yourself to only two questions during the Q&A session. The call will be archived on our website. Before I turn over to Peer Schatz, please keep in mind that the following discussion and the responses to your questions reflect management’s view as of today, July 26, 2011. As you listen to the call, I encourage you to have our press release and presentation in front of you, since our financial results and the detailed commentaries are included and will correspond to the discussion that follows. As we share information today to help you better understand our business, it is important to keep in mind that we will make statements and provide responses in the course of this conference call that state our intentions, beliefs, expectations, or predictions of the future. These constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the Safe Harbor provision. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause QIAGEN’s actual results to differ materially from those projected. QIAGEN disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements.

Additionally, we will be discussing GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in the press release on our website. With this, I would like to hand over to Peer Schatz. Peer? Peer Schatz Yeah. Thank you, Solveigh. I would like to welcome all of you to our conference call and the opportunity to discuss our results for the second quarter 2011. The progress we’ve been making on our strategy and our perspectives on the second half of the year. As we outlined 2011 is a transition year with difficult comps. At the same time, it is also year for us to build up our portfolio of molecular content and rollout our new automation platforms that we believe will create substantial growth opportunities in 2012 and beyond. As you saw in the press release issued last night, results in the second quarter improved over the second period of 2010. We delivered higher net sales and earnings along with the significant increase in our free cash flow. Those results were also an improvement on the soft start to the year that we saw in the first quarter. At the same time, we are clearly not growing at a level that we believe is satisfactory. However, we are making broad progress in our strategic initiatives to expand in 2011 in order to accelerate growth in 2012. This progress is reflected in the milestone that our teams have achieved. The global rollout is going well for QIAsymphony. We have now reached installed base of 475 systems worldwide. QIAsymphony is a highly versatile, modular automation platform that we believe will play a key role in the dissemination of molecular technologies, and in particular will be the driving force for the expanding use of our molecular assays. Every placement creates an opportunity for annual consumable sales or so called pull-through of anywhere between 30,000 and $300,000. Demand remains strong for the full QIAsymphony RGQ version. This was launched in late 2010 and incorporates the Rotor-Gene Q real-time PCR cycler along with the SP or sample preparation and AS for asset set of modules that were launched in recent years. In personalized healthcare we reached an important milestone by completing the landmark regulatory submission of the KRAS biomarkers, a companion diagnostic paired with the anti-cancer medicine. This is the most significant achievement today from our more than 15 co-development projects underway with major pharmaceutical companies. In fact we will complete our second separate PMA submission in the U.S. this week. It involves the use of KRAS biomarker with another anti-cancer medicine, also for patients with colorectal cancer. In addition, we are very actively expanding our projects of co-development projects and I’ll talk to that later. We’re making progress in completing two important acquisitions both of which were announced in the second quarter. The Cellestis and Ipsogen both add important molecular content, in other words molecular test to the menu of our platforms. This will support QIAGEN and our ambition to be the world leader in molecular diagnostics. I will provide more insights on these acquisitions later on in our presentation. In terms of expanding our geographic presence, our new direct operations in India are growing quickly. Another expansion step this year was our direct entry into Taiwan during the second quarter. We are looking at various options for other regions with the attractive growth potential. As we noted in our release, 2011 is proving to be more challenging than anticipated at the start of the year given the continued weak economic conditions. Based on these factors and also to incorporate the Cellestis and Ipsogen acquisitions, we have updated expectations. We are expecting faster growth rates in the second half of the year compared to the first half of 2011 but had a more moderate rate than we have predicted earlier. We are expecting the most deviations to our forecast in the life sciences. This is also had an impact on our full year expectations. In summary, QIAGEN is making broad progress on our strategic initiatives and are committed to achieving our updated expectations. We are intensifying our focus on growth and innovation and are confident that QIAGEN is well positioned for sustained business expansion. Before we get into more depth, I’d like to handover to Roland for a discussion on the financials. Roland? Roland Sackers Yes. Thank you, Peer, and good afternoon to everyone in Europe and good morning to those joining from the U.S. The second quarter of 2011 for QIAGEN came in largely as expected, delivering improved performance and solid gains in free cash flow. Recapping the key numbers, net sales for the second quarter rose 7% plus 1% at constant exchange rate or to US$282 million from the second quarter of 2010. Consumables contributed solid net sales growth, which was partially offset by lower sales of instruments. Adjusted gross profit was up 9% over the second quarter of 2010. This was in part due to product mix related sectors for consumables with higher HPV sales in North America. Sales to marketing expenditure increased by 15% over the second quarter of 2010. Increased promotional activities supportive to QIAsymphony rollout going direct in India and Taiwan, as well as investing in direct sales channels activities were the key drivers of the percentage increase in the year-over-year result. We continued to increase our efficiencies and have those economies up-scaled thereby driving down G&A expenditure by 5% over the second quarter 2010. Overall, therefore, SG&A expenditure was up 9% over the same period last year. We are maintaining our profitability by keeping margins steady in comparison to the second quarter 2010. This is reflected in the 8% growth in adjusted operating income to US$78.7 million and the adjusted operating income margin remaining at 28%. It is also worthwhile to keep in mind that this is happening alongside strong investments in R&D and an aggressive push to further expand a new geographic region. We are expecting to further enhance productivity and improve the value of our business operations by reducing the cost of routine operations. Performance oriented workforce management and reallocation of resources to grow initiatives are anticipated to provide additional benefits for our adjusted operating income margin as we move through the remainder of 2011. Moving to our adjusted diluting earnings per share, this rose to $0.23 in the second quarter from $0.22 in the same period of 2010. In terms of non-operating factors, we have told you in the past about the sustainable benefits that would come, be coming from our tax optimization strategy. Free cash flow in the second quarter improved 31% to US$37.8 million over the year ago period. Effective working capital management remains to be an important focus for us. Our free cash flow adjusted for building investment increased 24%. Capital expenditures over the past two years in R&D and production facilities have been quite substantial, particularly from major construction activities at our sites in Germany and Maryland. DSOs were 65 days at the end of the second quarter compared to 68 days for the first quarter and level with 65 days a year ago. So, overall our results in the second quarter of 2011 showed our ability to deliver year-over-year growth while preserving our profitability and achieving our adjusted EPS target and meet continued challenging market conditions. I am now on slide Six. In terms of geographic results, in the Americas we had net sales growth of 5% at constant exchange rate. We are seeing some solid trends in the U.S. HPV market. Mainly we believe conversion is the critical component as unemployment rate in the U.S. remains high and IMS data confirms that doctor visits are still down. Uncertainty over the NIH budget as part of the discretionary budget cuts in the U.S. is having an effect on grant funding grades, which had an all-time low. We believe this is having a direct impact on some of our customers in the U.S. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, sales dipped by 5% at constant exchange rate. Although QIAsymphony demand remains strong and sales from molecular products are performing well. We have a number of forces working against us in Southern Europe, particularly Italy. In addition, timing of certain companion diagnostic development milestones and also the impact of measures we have recently taken to transition several sales channels weighted on the results this past quarter. The Asia-Pacific, Japan region where we saw a significant impact from disruptive event in the first quarter has recovered nicely. Product in life science in China as well as the general market recovery in Japan contributed to grow fast in these countries. We continue to support the recovery of Japan and are collaborating with government agencies in terms of human identification and infectious disease testing product. On the other hand one of the disappointments of the second quarter has been the sales growth in Molecular Diagnostics, China. This is a market where we had traditionally very high growth rate. However, we encountered slower than anticipated sales results following the ramp-up of our clinical sales channel in this country. We significantly increased this channel in 2010 and had high hopes already for the first half of 2011. Despite this delay in the anticipated boost per sales, we believe this slowdown is only of a temporary nature. Moving on to slide seven, I would like to provide some comments on our financial position for the first half year 2011. Highlighting our strong liquidity position is our equity ratio of 65%. We have provided some pro forma data to incorporate upcoming completion of Cellestis and Ipsogen acquisitions. And this shows a ratio of 64%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is currently at minus 0.2 times, but will rise to 1.1 times after completion of these acquisitions on a pro forma basis. Our cash flow proposition allows us to pursue growth in investment plan without depending on unstated credit markets and with limited exposure to interest rate development. Both operating and free cash flow has continued to increase steadily. For the six months period ended June 30, 2011, we generated net cash from operating activities of US$106.1 million. Free cash flow excluding developed investments in building for the first half 2011 was US$86.2 million. Capital expenditures in recent years have been rather significant as we invested in underpinned future growth. In June, we largely completed construction of new R&D and production facilities in Germany. Notable here is that preparation for the transfer of production activities, we increased inventories to allow for higher sales destock. I would now like to hand back to Peer for strategy update. Peer Schatz Yeah. Thank you, Roland and we are now on slide nine. I’d like to provide some perspectives on the performance of our four customer classes. Molecular diagnostics, which represented 46% of net sales in the quarter rose 2% on constant exchange rates; solid single-digit growth and consumables was reduced by lower reported sales of instruments. Instrument sales again reflected the shift towards reagent rental agreements, in which we place an instrument at the customer sight in return for a guaranteed annual purchase of consumables. Revenue is then recognized over the term of the multi-year contract. In prevention, we’ve recorded growth in HPV sales in the U.S. Our market conversion initiatives were up about 10% in the quarter and penetration of available market is approaching 45%. Our conversion efforts more than offset effects from reduced patient visits and pricing. On the other hand, we are seeing data that patient visits are down sequentially from the first quarter of the year. This was expected and it is being confirmed by other industry participants. It was one of the reasons for our conservative outlook for overall 2011 that we gave earlier this year. Like our competitors, we still face economic headwinds. The U.S. unemployment rate has not improved much, and this is reflected in enrollment trends for managed care programs. We had expected improving trends based on economic forecasts. Based on the current environment, it is difficult to make predictions for the second half of the year. We are obviously asked about our views on the entry of competitors on the U.S. HPV market. Will there eventually be an impact? Yes. This is to be expected when you have new competitors in the market, but it is clear that none of the competitor assays are anywhere close to being validated to the extent of Qiagen’s assay, and none have superior data. We’re using this to our advantage and are pleased that customers recognize this value. Our focus is on expanding the market, growing it ourselves and for ourselves, and for our customers. Applied testing, which is currently 7% of net sales, delivered solid growth in consumables. Here, too, results were reduced by softer instrument sales. Qiagen is a key supplier of human identification products to the Japanese Government as part of the recovery efforts after the disasters in March. Also, in Japan, Qiagen recently won a very important national tender to deliver forensic products to the country police. This again underscores the highly competitive position of our human identification portfolio. Pharma was 21% of net sales and largely unchanged overall. On one side we are benefiting from sustained demand from molecular technologies to support team-based drug development activities. Among top performing product lines is also the certain portfolio. This is a new asset portfolio that runs on QIAsymphony and is used to test for residual DNA during manufacturing processes. However in pharma R&D, the R side remains challenging, mid industry consolidation and cost containment measures. Academia which was 26% of net sales is pacing increasing pressure in key markets. We are seeing substantial increased caution in purchasing behavior due to uncertainty about budgetary restrictions, in particular in the United States. Net sales were up 1% at constant exchange rates and again the key issue was the decline in instrument sales. In light of the changing market environment, which is being accelerated by budgetary constraints, we are stepping up expansion of our direct marketing channels and electronic touch points to customers. Moving to the next slide, we’re making broad progress on many of our key initiatives. All of these are supporting our objective to leverage our leadership in Sample & Assay Technologies across our four customer classes. QIAsymphony RGQ is our flagship platform. It offers unprecedented flexibility in automation to customers requiring a broad menu in processing from 1 to 300 samples per shift. Our top priority remains to increase placements around the world and to continue to expand the Assay menu. We have achieved about one-third of our placement target for 2011. Given the long selling process for these types of systems, we’ve been saying that the majority of placements are anticipated in the second half of the year. Related to that, as most of you know, the majority of the placements will involve reagent rental agreements. While the impact of placements will not be immediately recognized in our reported sales, trends on pull-through of consumables are encouraging and bode very well for driving growth in the coming years. In May, we announced the comprehensive update of the QIAensemble suite of automation platforms. QIAensemble Evolution which was initiated in 2011, caused for the addition of modules to improve the automation for the current Rapid Capture System. The Decapper units, level of which are already in the field are on track for full launch in the fourth quarter and feedback from customer field testing has been extremely positive. QIAensemble Revolution program intense to build on the proven core components from QIAsymphony and this will enhance the computability of the two platforms in our testing menus. I’d like to spend more time now providing you some insights into the strategic initiatives of first adding molecular content to our automation platforms, and number two strengthening our leadership in personal healthcare as well as create, expanding our geographic presence. Moving to the first topic, adding molecular content on slide 11, our latest two acquisition Cellestis and Ipsogen fully support our strategic initiative to add molecular content to our novel platforms. We’re moving towards completion of the acquisition process for Cellestis, an Australian diagnostic company. Shareholder meeting is now planned for early August and closing is expected later in the month. As you know, QIAGEN amended its proposal for Cellestis in early July with the aim of securing a rapid completion of this transaction. The current Cellestis share price and the shareholder voting trends confirmed that this transaction should receive very strong approval. Cellestis is a profitable publically listed company with two marketed product QuantiFERON-TB for detection of latent TB and QuantiFERON-CMV for the detection of cytomegalovirus, which is a threat in solid organ transplantation. This slide show shows how we believe the combination of Cellestis and QIAGEN can generate greater results for QIAGEN. Cellestis will provide us with exclusive access to QuantiFERON assay technology. As a next generation proprietary technology, it is capable of acquiring a previously untapped information source in the human body. QuantiFERON is considered pre-molecular testing technology, because it has the capability to provide diagnostic information far earlier than DNA based molecular tests. As a result, test based on the technology can provide information on latent infections, in other words hiding infections, when DNA based tests cannot, because of the lower amount of pathogens present in the infection. Because of this ability, QuantiFERON can complement our portfolio of molecular diagnostics by guiding and driving the use of DNA and RNA based molecular tests. We believe that Cellestis as part of QIAGEN will enhance our molecular diagnostics offering from pre-molecular through prevention, profiling personalized healthcare and point-of-need testing. As a sample in assay technology just like our other products, we plan to migrate it to QIAGEN Instruments. QuantiFERON TB is already being commercialized in a number of markets, particularly in the United States and Europe and Japan. A very significant untapped market potential, and QIAGEN sales and marketing operations around the world will be instrumental in driving this expansion. We’re planning to make large investments in sales capabilities and R&D initiatives to integrate the latent TB test on the QIAGEN platforms. This acquisition will be supportive to sales growth and be accretive to adjusted EPS starting in 2012. Turning to the next slide, our Cellestis acquisition has a technology focus, but the current TB products also have a very attractive market profile. In combination with our molecular diagnostics for TB, we’re creating the leading next generation position in TB. QIAGEN already has a wide range of molecular assays. An example for our capabilities here was the recent announcement that the Mayo Clinic has licensed patent rights from QIAGEN that will allow Mayo to offer a test for M. tuberculosis complex speciation. We’re also looking at ways to migrate our TB test to point of need devices. To understand the TB testing market, it is critical to understand the two different types of TB status; number one, active TB, which is basically full-blown disease with symptoms, and latent TB, where the patient has no symptoms but the disease can flare up at any point to threaten the patient and cause potential spreading of tuberculosis. In the developed world; United States, Europe and other developed countries, latent TB is far more important as a testing franchise than active TB. Latent TB tests are critical for identifying those at risk and immediately treading them, thereby reducing the disease burden and the potential spreading of TB. People undergoing routine testing include healthcare workers, college students, people in prisons and military. TB testing is also useful for immigration. We also see implication such as companion diagnostics, given that an increasing number of medicines require latent TB testing prior to first dosing. Regulatory clearances, reimbursement and guidelines are complete in most countries. So we’re going to work on global expansion. We were particularly pleased to see Germany adapt QuantiFERON-TB as the new standard shortly after we announced this acquisition. Turning to the next slide, I would like to offer some insights on Ipsogen and how the combination with QIAGEN will create significant opportunities. Ipsogen has a very competitive portfolio in blood cancer testing with assays covering more than 15 biomarkers including BCR-ABL and JAK2 for patient profiling and monitoring. The company also has several very interesting IP positions on content including the exclusive worldwide license for JAK2 V617F, the key mutation in the Janus 2 kinase. Portfolio is used to classify blood cancers into the various categories. There are four major classes and dozens of subclasses. Ipsogen assays set a strong standard for this classification worldwide. In addition, several of the biomarkers are being targeted by pharma companies for a range of blood cancers, is include BCR-ABL and in particular JAK2. So this deal is similar to what we did with B-Raf 3 Kinase in terms of gaining key intellectual property rights for important biomarkers, and with JAK2 we get a marketing product. Any of Ipsogen’s assays have significant potential as companion diagnostics to guide treatment decisions and personalized healthcare. We have the capabilities to offer a complete companion diagnostic solution to pharma companies and with these assays, we can extend our range of partnerships. The addition of Ipsogen has strengthened QIAGEN’s leadership and molecular diagnostics expanding both are profiling and personalized healthcare portfolios. As you know our position is driven by more than 20 molecular diagnostic assays available in selected regions of the world, as well as more than 15 personalized healthcare projects underway with pharmaceutical companies. This acquisition will support our sales growth in the second half of 2011, and be accretive to adjust EPS starting in 2013. Turning to slide 14, we are making dynamic progress in Personalized Healthcare, where QIAGEN is helping to match the right patients with the right drug, by offering companion diagnostics. We have built up by far the leading industry position with a portfolio of biomarkers to address needs for both solid and hematological cancers. As we announced on the last conference call, we are moving far beyond cancer to work on companion diagnostics for many other therapeutic areas. Among the more than 15 projects underway with major pharmaceutical companies, some of our partnerships are shared and thereby leveraged into multiple applications, which leads to more companion diagnostics in the pipeline. We should anticipate more co-development agreements being reached in the second half of 2011 as well. And in terms of regulatory submissions, after the filings for KRAS we are on track for other U.S. submissions, including the assay for the EGFR mutations in 2012, which will be its first submissions submitted for using combination with anti-cancer medicine for treatment of patients with the non-small cell lung cancer. I would now like to hand back to Roland. Roland? Roland Sackers Sure. Based on the completion of the Cellestis and Ipsogen acquisitions this year and to ongoing challenging market conditions, we have updated our expectations for 2011. For the second half of 2011, QIAGEN expect total sales growth of approximately 7% constant exchange rate of which approximately half is expected to come from organic growth. For the full year 2011, QIAGEN now expect total sales growth of approximately 3% with contributions from organic sales and acquisitions calculated using constant exchange rate. One of the factors to consider for the revenue distribution between the third and fourth quarter is that we have an unusual revenue allocation between these two periods. As you might recall, we have won several large HPV tenders global. Typically, the revenue from this these tenders are spread equally over the year. In the third quarter this will not be the case, but therefore we will increase significantly in the fourth quarter. Adjusted diluting earning per share are expected to be approximately $0.96 for 2011, which includes previously announced expectation for the dilution of approximately $0.03 per share related to planned sales and R&D investments as part of the acquisition of Cellestis and Ipsogen. Turning to the next slide, in terms of adjustments to operating income, we expect equity based compensation of U.S. $5 million for each of the next two periods. Amortization of acquired IP of approximately 27 million next quarter and approximately 29 million in the fourth quarter, business integration, acquisition and restructuring of 12 to 14 million in third and 3 to 4 million in the fourth quarter. This is a significant increase due to transaction cost for Ipsogen and Cellestis. This quarter our adjusted tax rate was 23%, thus lower than the comparable quarter last year with 25%. And going forward, this third quarter, we believe this to be in the range between 24 and 26%, thereafter for the fourth quarter in the range of 22 to 24%. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding will be around 240 million shares. Peer? Peer Schatz Thanks Roland. I’m now on slide 17 to provide a quick summary before we move into Q&A. As mentioned at the start, the challenging economic environment is more persistent than we had anticipated. In Q2 our market continued to be soft. We achieved some growth, but it is hard to predict how much improvement we will see in the second half. Against the backdrop of the underlying business performance, it is important to see the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives. We are creating a foundation for future growth. We are pleased with the progress we are making to deliver on some of these strategic goals. The global roll-out of the QIAsymphony RGQ is progressing well and the installed base is now exceeded at 475 systems. Our companion diagnostic projects in Personalized Healthcare reached to an important milestone with the first U.S. submission for a TheraScreen KRAS biomarker. A second submission is coming within a few days and look from more developments in this area. We are adding molecular content with the addition of Cellestis and Ipsogen, and we are moving ahead with the development of new assays and potential submissions in 2011. And we are expanding our geographic presence in emerging regions of the world. We have updated our full-year guidance to give you the clearest view possible, and also to incorporate the pending acquisitions. As a result of actions to implement our strategies we are well positioned to expand in 2011 and to further accelerate growth into 2012. With that, I would like to hand back to Solveigh to open up the Q&A session. Solveigh? Dr. Solveigh Mähler Yeah. Thank you very much, Peer. We are now looking forward to discussing your questions. I would like to open the Q&A session by handing over the operator. Jason? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Mr. Lai. Please state your name, company name followed by your question. Quintin Lai – Robert W. Baird Hi, good morning. This is Quintin Lai from Robert W. Baird. We – Peer Schatz Good morning, Quintin. Quintin Lai – Robert W. Baird Looking at the – putting together kind of your comments of about the outlook and then looking at the back half of the year guidance, maybe give us a little bit more color on the visibility that you have. I mean, obviously Q3 looks flat relative to kind of Q2 and Q4 picks up. Now Q4 does haven’t looks like an easier year-over-year comp, but you also mentioned visibility in some tenders, is that all this baked into guidance or Peer are you expecting a pick-up in the overall end markets in the fourth quarter? Peer Schatz Yeah. Thanks for the question, Quintin. I think it’s important to say that we are basically expecting a very similar underlying performance in the second half of the year, as we’ve seen in the first half of the year. So we are not expecting any changes in the economic environment, which was the original outlook that we had given in early in the year, I think and good company with many other participants in this space that there would be a reduction in unemployment, improvement in the healthcare markets, and we see an improving market outlook in the second half of the year. This is now being taken out of the underlying business expectations for the second half of the year. So is similar performance for the second half of the year as we’ve seen in the first half of the year. The one twist to that is that with our several larger development milestones and from the companion diagnostic partnerships and also the – some very significant national tenders that will lead to revenue recognition in the fourth quarter versus the third. And these dates are typically set well in advance and it so happens that revenue recognition for those that fall into the fourth quarter versus the third. But if you take those one time kind of like this more, these two allocations of revenue into the fourth quarter out of the picture, the underlying base is now pretty much assuming the same environment as we have seen in the first-half of the year. Quintin Lai – Robert W. Baird Okay. And then kind of as a follow-up question here. QIAsymphony placements were again a good quarter understand reagent rental. As we look forward, the reagent rental model usually means that we start to see revenues, start to become a recurring item here over the next quarters. Those systems that you are placing, can we assume that they are on the upper end of the $330,000 to $300,000 reagent fulfill rate? Peer Schatz It’s difficult to call a trend right now because the RGQ system with the corresponding assays have been rolling out now over the last nine months basically, and the encouraging news is that we have many accounts that are actually pushing the height limit of this number. And this, if you calculate the throughput of the system and the potential pull through, it’s actually much higher than $300,000 a year, but we are seeing a number of customers pull this very, already pushing this very high numbers. So I wouldn’t call this a trend yet. I would take the average lower than that, might be in the range of 150 right now. But this could be – this could simply be an early indication of where everything is going as the menu expands. In diagnostics, the game is always the same. You basically create a platform. You aggressively roll that out. That’s the phase we are right now and at the same time you expand your menu which we’re also doing. We talked about companion diagnostics, APSI gen and some of the virology assays and transplant panels that we already have, that already passed the regulatory hurdles are being submitted and that creates an exponential sale after that. Once we have a critical mass menu in the regions, also in Asia and the United States, I think you’ll have a much clearer picture but the number is very encouraging and it’s on the high end currently. Quintin Lai – Robert W. Baird Thanks. Operator The next question comes from Mr. Quirk. Please state your name, company name followed by your question. Bill Quirk – Piper Jaffray Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Good afternoon, everybody. Peer Schatz Good morning, Bill. Bill Quirk – Piper Jaffray So, a couple of questions here I guess just to – I guess take Quintin’s question and dig a little deeper here, in terms of the delta on the timing for the recognition of the tenders in the third and fourth quarter, is there any way to just quantify that and just to make this I guess a little more obvious to tease the two out. Peer Schatz Yeah. Roland, do you want to take that one. Roland Sackers Yeah, sure. I think I stressed that before we – in the past we won a couple of these large HPV tenders and also seen that coming in as well and so what we see here is that normally we have this equally spreaded over the quarter and especially one tender is something where we – as first said before expect more revenue recognition in fourth quarter, as well as the third quarter and partially also in the second quarter. And that gives clearly for the fourth quarter just out of that low double-digit million U.S. dollar amount. And in addition to that we clearly pushed ahead quite significantly for the last couple of weeks with our KRAS filings. And therefore, of course, we expect other milestone related – development milestone related revenues more for the fourth quarter than for the third quarter. Peer Schatz Okay. Yeah, that clearly both together gives an – I would say dysfunctional allocation between the third and fourth quarter. Normally should spread more under both quarters quite equally. Definitely we pulled it out very detailed for the third and fourth quarter. Roland Sackers Okay. Very good. Thanks for the extra color there. Appreciate that. And then secondly, Peer, just to talk a little bit, I guess, dig a little deeper into the academic market, you mentioned that obviously condition in Southern Europe remain challenging that there appears to be a bit hesitation among some of the U.S. customers as people waited to do it, (inaudible) supposed to check out. To what extent can you comment on just shifting priorities from the customer base to like modalities sequencing, for example, is this playing a role in what you are seeing in the underlying business? Thanks. Peer Schatz Yeah. Good question, Bill. There is definitely a shift right now in some of the spending, which probably is temporary and caused by the ARRA ending continuing. So there is still rollout of the number of stimulus moneys that are being allocated typically towards larger ticket CapEx items. The underlying growth of the academic markets is currently very soft and the discussion around potential budget cuts in the national institutes of health budgets, but also in other budgets around the world is definitely not creating a lot of certainty and a positive momentum. So there is a great caution right now in lot of these markets. I think the allocation of funds out of the ARRA and other areas is much easier to do and they are allocated more towards noble big ticket items. But going forward, this will definitely be more difficult. If you look at the overall markets, the academic markets worldwide, now you are talking of 50, $60 billion market or so. And so even if you assume that there is a net impact capital decreases down and next generation sequencing up, but a few hundred million maybe and up to a couple of billion dollars. At some point in time, this is not a huge enough unlike allocation to really change the momentum of these markets. We are interpreting the majority of this impact right now to budget uncertainties that are not associated with one-time longer plan, larger capital equipment investments. Bill Quirk – Piper Jaffray Got it. Thank you very much. Peer Schatz I’d like to maybe highlight if you look at our underlying growth, it this pretty much the industry. There are a number of other players in this industry. They are showing very similar performance in this area, and in particular, in the molecular technologies that (inaudible) showing premium run rates in this space and have gone to a very conservative overall growth in the first half of this year. Bill Quirk – Piper Jaffray Got it. Thanks, Peer. Peer Schatz Thanks. Operator Your next question is from Ms. De Lima. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Brigitte de Lima – Bank of America Merrill Lynch Good afternoon. Brigitte de Lima from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I’ve got two questions with a few sub-questions in between. The first one is on Cellestis. You talked about some significant investments to migrate the Cellestis test into the Qiagen platform. Does this in any shape or form comprise your original targets achieved on adjusted operating profit margin of around 31% by the end of 2013? Are you now finding that you’re having to invest more than you anticipated? And then a second question is again on the QIAsymphony. How do the 475 placements i.e. around 75 traditional placements in the second quarter compare to your original internal expectations? And also, could you provide any color as to what the split is between placements in Europe versus other countries like the U.S.? Peer Schatz Sure. Thanks for clarifying the statements I made around the Cellestis or giving me the opportunity to clarify them. We had already planned for the transition of the Cellestis assays onto our platforms when we gave the outlook for investments and expenditures and accretion from this transaction in April. So, these expectations are fully baked and the programs are well underway. In particular, also we’ve added the point-of-need testing platforms, which are seeing significant interest now to have the latent TB test is part of the testing menu for them. So that is rolling out fully in plan and there’s no change to our forecast in terms of expenditures and accretion and timeline. The second question was in terms of the roll-out of the systems. If you look at the numbers as they’re rolling out for these very complex systems and the menu that is unfolding, the numbers are good for this second quarter, as well. If you annualize that, you get to good numbers. And we feel very good about the outlook and the funnel. We can’t give the internal estimates here. We always want more, but we’re building a very good funnel. And as we discussed before, the pull-through of assays is actually very good as well. It’s probably even higher than what we originally expected. The allocation geographically reflects the availability of menu. So we have substantially more placements currently in Europe than we have in the United States. But the United States numbers are ramping up very quickly and the pipeline is actually very fairly weighted. So we expect to see assays become available for the QIAsymphony RGQ system. There are a number of reagents and ASRs and other products that customers are using in various ways. But as we are clearing more menu going forward, we have a number of submissions in the foreseeable future now for this system as well, there will be a very similar ramp up of the – or the weighting will become very similar and also the consumables pull through will become more similar as well. In Europe, we’re offering the full menu, and where we are extremely strong is actually in the blood virals, hepatitis and HIV in addition to some of the esoteric testing panels that we are very well known for and we expect a similar picture to emerge in the United States as these assays become available. And would like to add to that, Cellestis will be for 2011, again, just to reconfirm that accretive by 2 to $0.03 on adjusted EPS, so we see there significant pick up in profitability once we have migrated them to our platform. 2012. Brigitte de Lima – Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks again. Peer Schatz 2012, Roland. Brigitte de Lima – Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yes 2012, yeah. Operator The next question is from Mr. Blum. Please state your name, your company name followed by your question. Holger Blum – Deutsche Bank Hi. Holger Blum from Deutsche Bank. Just three questions. First one on clarification on the HPV tender. Did you win the tender already or are they still to come? Second question would be on the reagent rental contract. Maybe you can give us some background here, what is the proportion of these kind of contracts today? And maybe you can say how that was two years ago and how it might be in two years’ time from now? And maybe if you can also from your perspective, share your thoughts on the MPV and these new contracts. Is it overall MPV neutral or if you have later on maybe high margins on the consumables. Or is it maybe still more negative or any kind of guidance there would be appreciated. Third question would be just on the – an update on the Abbott’s HIV Hepatitis C tests, when do you expect the launch there? How is a transformation progressing there? Thank you. Peer Schatz Yeah, thanks. Okay. The first question was regarding the tenders. Yeah, we don’t want to highlight any specific tender or give too much detail on. These are obviously competitive situations. But we were constantly winning tenders and also large ones and we wouldn’t be putting them in if there wouldn’t be a very high certainty that we have them or that we already have them. So we feel very confident in these projections. Holger Blum – Deutsche Bank Okay. Peer Schatz Number two is the reagent rental distribution. The reagent rentals were almost zero two years ago. We had very few reagent rentals. Today, on the QIAsymphony it’s more than half, it’s probably approaching three quarters. And at some point in time, I would say in two years out that number will probably go even higher. As I said in the last quarter, the reagent rentals are very good sign, because this means that the laboratory is actually willing to commit their own revenue stream to using this platform. If they just buy the system to play around with it, it’s a different story. If they buy the system and commit to using our assays, that means they are shifting their own revenue generation or services in other words to relying on our assays as well. But we’re very pleased with this pickup, and the NPVF this is very positive. So we’re putting in very conservative financial metrics getting quick paybacks of these systems and the consumables have a high degree of profitability. So these systems pay very quickly for themselves. Holger Blum – Deutsche Bank Okay. Last question was on your arrangement with Abbott and the HPV launch timeline? Peer Schatz Yeah. There is really nothing new to say on that. We’re in development right now on these assays and are moving forward to bring them forward to the market. We wanted to once we have the development plan fully laid out and also the regulatory pathway cleared. These assays are little more complex. We will come out with that on that, but I assume this would be – around our Analyst Day we’d be happy to give details on that. But it – definitely it remains a very important cornerstone of our assay portfolio that we see for the foreseeable future. Holger Blum – Deutsche Bank Okay. Good. Well, maybe last question, although it’s maybe a bit early for you to comment on it, would you dare to provide any kind of organic growth projection for 2012 or that’s too early at this stage, or do what you think is feasible? Peer Schatz I’d probably like to answer it this way that the current underlying performance is definitely not satisfactory and we are adapting the company to achieve also with the underlying business a better performance. We were talking about changes that we made to the channels, changes that we made to emerging regions, changes that we made to also some allocation of resources among the various customer classes. But what we’re doing on top of that while still a smaller percentage of our overall sales is moving ahead very nicely and I’d like to highlight the companion, our personalized medicine initiatives that we have and QIAsymphony rollout, and also the progress of our QIAensemble development program, which is moving on very nicely now in its new format, and going forward we think even further increase our competitiveness here. So a lot of things that are adding growth, inflection points now over the course of 2012 that we’re looking forward to generate. We had the first landmark submissions of KRAS as a companion diagnostic as I said before. You can expect a second one this week as well, and these things will hopefully provide a very good increased visibility of the growth opportunities that we have for 2012 that we will put into numbers when we give guidance for the full year. Holger Blum – Deutsche Bank Okay. Thank you. Peer Schatz Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Mr. Peterson. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan Yeah, it’s Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Peer, on your comments before the academic market, I think you also talked about accelerating your direct sales channels. Can you just talk a little bit more about what that entails? Peer Schatz Yeah. Thanks, Tycho. That definitely is an important trend. What we’re seeing right now is that we have to aware in the academic markets that the majority of the academic customers, I’d say 80% or so probably never even see a sales person. And even largest players in the space have only a limited reach or touch points into their effective customers. So what most people are exploring right now and we’ve really taken a very strong and may be in some cases call it a leading position and is exploring how to increase the number of touch points into academic customers using novel techniques, it’s not only electronic, it’s also using call centers and similar. And these services are being received very positively by our customers. And we started that much more actively last year and we always had an insight sales activities much more refined and mandate. And we started that early this year and are continuing ramp it up as we see the market shifting. And there is definitely a shift in the academic markets and it needs a change in response and this is – we’re responding to it. Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan And then on may be just shifting over to QIAsymphony are you able to talk it all about what percentage of the systems that are out there have been competitive wins? Or alternatively upgrades to existing instruments it’s got to be one or the other presumably? Roland Sackers Yeah, I’d say almost all of them are competitive because they typically are dense retenders and or at least to a comparative process. And so I think, it’d be very rare to say that there is – we obviously have many extremely loyal clients and customers who are extremely valuable often to us where we’ve been – would have a natural upgrade. But the majority are clearly looking at whatever might be considered a competitive system in the marketplace, but we have been providing very, very clear wins. And the win rate has been very impressive. This is also reflected, if you look at some of the numbers of these systems out there. They are typically – after five years, 10 years or so to be in the several hundred maybe a little bit over thousand. And we in a very short period of time are now approaching 500 systems, it just shows that there is a significant adoption that we’re getting here and it definitely is a sweet spot in the market. What we need now is, for the assay pull-through to come through for the money to expand on these systems and that will generate very substantial returns for them. But we’re currently in investment phase of this rollout. Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan Okay. And then the comments on China were a little bit surprising around the molecular diagnostic business. Can you just elaborate on – I know it’s a nascent market for you, but what the underlying dynamics are there? Roland Sackers Yeah. While we have a very strong activity in China and the market is definitely growing, but we had more hopes for the Chinese market because we made substantial investments in 2010 to create a clinical sales channel. The clinical sales channel very comparable to what we have here in the United States is creating demand for in particular HPV testing. But also other assays that we have in the portfolio we have a number of SAP approved assays in China. Just expanded the portfolio actually in the first half of the year again quite considerably. So there was a hope that this clinical sales channel, which would provide similar gross stimuli to the underlying business then we’ve seen here in the United States typically have effect. And this was a little bit slower. It has to do with the way that the Chinese market works. It was absolutely the right decision to do. And we expect to reap the benefits of this clinical sales channel, future period, but it didn’t come as fast as we originally thought. And then the focus and attention that we put on to this distracted it from other areas made the growth a little bit more subdued in the MDx market. So we didn’t typically see the 30, 40% growth than we typically see in this market. We saw similar in the life sciences, but in the MDx area we see what – seeing what we think is a temporary dip in that growth rate, which would – should reemerge. Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan Okay. Then last one on HPV, I understand you don’t want to give a lot of color on the tenders. But is there any change in kind of dynamic around pricing terms, duration of contracts, technology out clauses, other aspects that you’re hearing about the market? Roland Sackers Sure. Well, the market – actually our revenues HPV grew in the North America in the second quarter. So it came from very soft performance in the first quarter into growth in the second quarter. We have actually been very successful in the full light of a – of competitive products from strong companies, been able to climb and extend and expand dozens of contracts again in the first half of this year. And we see a very strong competitive profile increasingly emerging. Now this is helped by a number of things. First of all our platform expansions, so called QIAensemble, the evolution program, which I think is a little bit underestimated in public view, but I think if you talk to laboratories you see that the addition of these modules that we put on to the existing Rapid Capture system make this a very, very competitive workflow. And the – and that going forward is creating a good opportunity for us to continue our very strong competitive position. There is one thing that I’d like to highlight as well, you know, we had some recent very important announcements last week on the IOM, that decided to add HPV testing to a Preventive Services Task Force list. And this basically would remove co-payment, or in other words significantly reduce or eliminate the link to economic trends. But I don’t want to overplay, but this is an extremely important decision that was made by the IOM, obviously an extremely important body that decided to come out to support this. So going forward starting 2013, when this will affect the co-payments, we’ll probably even start early as insurance companies are starting to move over to accept these new standards. We’ll remove co-payment from HPV testing detaching it then from economic trends and making it a much more robust and independent and reliable revenue stream. The interesting thing is that the focused areas on negative predicted value, which really only QIAGEN can prove in long-term studies. And it focuses on HPV DNA based testing and clearly also limiting a technology that has been applied. So, there are a number of very important trends that are working for us here and we’re actively also shaping this market. Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan Okay. Thank you. Roland Sackers Thanks, Tycho. Operator The next question is from Mr. Welford. Please state your name, company name and your question. Peter Welford – Jefferies Hi, it’s Peter Welford from Jefferies. Two questions. Firstly, just going to the applied testing, as interestingly you comment about weak instrument sales, I wanted to give us some more visibility on why in particular applied testing you think you’re seeing a slowdown in instrument placements there. And then, perhaps secondly then, just looking at the reagent rental agreements, do you put in place for these agreements minimum purchase requirements for the customers and how do they – how do you, I guess lock in the customers for those agreements, or is it a moment relatively flexible given the early stage of the roll-out of these products. Thank you. Peer Schatz Thanks. Good questions. Second one is the minimum number of sales. Yes there is a contractual commitment that the client gives in terms of assay or consumable pull-through or revenue pull-through to Qiagen. So that is the underlying dream that we use for our financial analysis and it’s based on commitments. Number two is the applied testing automation growth that I would attribute more to timing and to year-over-year effect. The applied testing team is moving ahead very nicely. We’re seeing very good trends in this space and we expect them to make or exceed their target. So this also includes the instrumentation components that are working very nicely for them, as they are also leveraging the QIAsymphony, RGQ and components. Peter Welford – Jefferies That’s great, thank you. Peer Schatz Thanks. Dr. Solveigh Mähler And with this I would like to close the conference call by thanking you all for participating. We hope to welcome you again to our third quarter 2011 earnings conference call on Thursday, November 03, 2011. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Please state your name, company name followed by your question. Quintin Lai – Robert W. Baird Hi, good morning. This is Quintin Lai from Robert W. Baird. We – Peer Schatz Good morning, Quintin. Quintin Lai – Robert W. Baird Looking at the – putting together kind of your comments of about the outlook and then looking at the back half of the year guidance, maybe give us a little bit more color on the visibility that you have. I mean, obviously Q3 looks flat relative to kind of Q2 and Q4 picks up. Now Q4 does haven’t looks like an easier year-over-year comp, but you also mentioned visibility in some tenders, is that all this baked into guidance or Peer are you expecting a pick-up in the overall end markets in the fourth quarter? Peer Schatz Yeah. Thanks for the question, Quintin. I think it’s important to say that we are basically expecting a very similar underlying performance in the second half of the year, as we’ve seen in the first half of the year. So we are not expecting any changes in the economic environment, which was the original outlook that we had given in early in the year, I think and good company with many other participants in this space that there would be a reduction in unemployment, improvement in the healthcare markets, and we see an improving market outlook in the second half of the year. This is now being taken out of the underlying business expectations for the second half of the year. So is similar performance for the second half of the year as we’ve seen in the first half of the year. The one twist to that is that with our several larger development milestones and from the companion diagnostic partnerships and also the – some very significant national tenders that will lead to revenue recognition in the fourth quarter versus the third. And these dates are typically set well in advance and it so happens that revenue recognition for those that fall into the fourth quarter versus the third. But if you take those one time kind of like this more, these two allocations of revenue into the fourth quarter out of the picture, the underlying base is now pretty much assuming the same environment as we have seen in the first-half of the year. Quintin Lai – Robert W. Baird Okay. And then kind of as a follow-up question here. QIAsymphony placements were again a good quarter understand reagent rental. As we look forward, the reagent rental model usually means that we start to see revenues, start to become a recurring item here over the next quarters. Those systems that you are placing, can we assume that they are on the upper end of the $330,000 to $300,000 reagent fulfill rate? Peer Schatz It’s difficult to call a trend right now because the RGQ system with the corresponding assays have been rolling out now over the last nine months basically, and the encouraging news is that we have many accounts that are actually pushing the height limit of this number. And this, if you calculate the throughput of the system and the potential pull through, it’s actually much higher than $300,000 a year, but we are seeing a number of customers pull this very, already pushing this very high numbers. So I wouldn’t call this a trend yet. I would take the average lower than that, might be in the range of 150 right now. But this could be – this could simply be an early indication of where everything is going as the menu expands. In diagnostics, the game is always the same. You basically create a platform. You aggressively roll that out. That’s the phase we are right now and at the same time you expand your menu which we’re also doing. We talked about companion diagnostics, APSI gen and some of the virology assays and transplant panels that we already have, that already passed the regulatory hurdles are being submitted and that creates an exponential sale after that. Once we have a critical mass menu in the regions, also in Asia and the United States, I think you’ll have a much clearer picture but the number is very encouraging and it’s on the high end currently. Quintin Lai – Robert W. Baird Thanks. Operator The next question comes from Mr. Quirk. Please state your name, company name followed by your question. Bill Quirk – Piper Jaffray Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Good afternoon, everybody. Peer Schatz Good morning, Bill. Bill Quirk – Piper Jaffray So, a couple of questions here I guess just to – I guess take Quintin’s question and dig a little deeper here, in terms of the delta on the timing for the recognition of the tenders in the third and fourth quarter, is there any way to just quantify that and just to make this I guess a little more obvious to tease the two out. Peer Schatz Yeah. Roland, do you want to take that one. Roland Sackers Yeah, sure. I think I stressed that before we – in the past we won a couple of these large HPV tenders and also seen that coming in as well and so what we see here is that normally we have this equally spreaded over the quarter and especially one tender is something where we – as first said before expect more revenue recognition in fourth quarter, as well as the third quarter and partially also in the second quarter. And that gives clearly for the fourth quarter just out of that low double-digit million U.S. dollar amount. And in addition to that we clearly pushed ahead quite significantly for the last couple of weeks with our KRAS filings. And therefore, of course, we expect other milestone related – development milestone related revenues more for the fourth quarter than for the third quarter. Peer Schatz Okay. Yeah, that clearly both together gives an – I would say dysfunctional allocation between the third and fourth quarter. Normally should spread more under both quarters quite equally. Definitely we pulled it out very detailed for the third and fourth quarter. Roland Sackers Okay. Very good. Thanks for the extra color there. Appreciate that. And then secondly, Peer, just to talk a little bit, I guess, dig a little deeper into the academic market, you mentioned that obviously condition in Southern Europe remain challenging that there appears to be a bit hesitation among some of the U.S. customers as people waited to do it, (inaudible) supposed to check out. To what extent can you comment on just shifting priorities from the customer base to like modalities sequencing, for example, is this playing a role in what you are seeing in the underlying business? Thanks. Peer Schatz Yeah. Good question, Bill. There is definitely a shift right now in some of the spending, which probably is temporary and caused by the ARRA ending continuing. So there is still rollout of the number of stimulus moneys that are being allocated typically towards larger ticket CapEx items. The underlying growth of the academic markets is currently very soft and the discussion around potential budget cuts in the national institutes of health budgets, but also in other budgets around the world is definitely not creating a lot of certainty and a positive momentum. So there is a great caution right now in lot of these markets. I think the allocation of funds out of the ARRA and other areas is much easier to do and they are allocated more towards noble big ticket items. But going forward, this will definitely be more difficult. If you look at the overall markets, the academic markets worldwide, now you are talking of 50, $60 billion market or so. And so even if you assume that there is a net impact capital decreases down and next generation sequencing up, but a few hundred million maybe and up to a couple of billion dollars. At some point in time, this is not a huge enough unlike allocation to really change the momentum of these markets. We are interpreting the majority of this impact right now to budget uncertainties that are not associated with one-time longer plan, larger capital equipment investments. Bill Quirk – Piper Jaffray Got it. Thank you very much. Peer Schatz I’d like to maybe highlight if you look at our underlying growth, it this pretty much the industry. There are a number of other players in this industry. They are showing very similar performance in this area, and in particular, in the molecular technologies that (inaudible) showing premium run rates in this space and have gone to a very conservative overall growth in the first half of this year. Bill Quirk – Piper Jaffray Got it. Thanks, Peer. Peer Schatz Thanks. Operator Your next question is from Ms. De Lima. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Brigitte de Lima – Bank of America Merrill Lynch Good afternoon. Brigitte de Lima from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I’ve got two questions with a few sub-questions in between. The first one is on Cellestis. You talked about some significant investments to migrate the Cellestis test into the Qiagen platform. Does this in any shape or form comprise your original targets achieved on adjusted operating profit margin of around 31% by the end of 2013? Are you now finding that you’re having to invest more than you anticipated? And then a second question is again on the QIAsymphony. How do the 475 placements i.e. around 75 traditional placements in the second quarter compare to your original internal expectations? And also, could you provide any color as to what the split is between placements in Europe versus other countries like the U.S.? Peer Schatz Sure. Thanks for clarifying the statements I made around the Cellestis or giving me the opportunity to clarify them. We had already planned for the transition of the Cellestis assays onto our platforms when we gave the outlook for investments and expenditures and accretion from this transaction in April. So, these expectations are fully baked and the programs are well underway. In particular, also we’ve added the point-of-need testing platforms, which are seeing significant interest now to have the latent TB test is part of the testing menu for them. So that is rolling out fully in plan and there’s no change to our forecast in terms of expenditures and accretion and timeline. The second question was in terms of the roll-out of the systems. If you look at the numbers as they’re rolling out for these very complex systems and the menu that is unfolding, the numbers are good for this second quarter, as well. If you annualize that, you get to good numbers. And we feel very good about the outlook and the funnel. We can’t give the internal estimates here. We always want more, but we’re building a very good funnel. And as we discussed before, the pull-through of assays is actually very good as well. It’s probably even higher than what we originally expected. The allocation geographically reflects the availability of menu. So we have substantially more placements currently in Europe than we have in the United States. But the United States numbers are ramping up very quickly and the pipeline is actually very fairly weighted. So we expect to see assays become available for the QIAsymphony RGQ system. There are a number of reagents and ASRs and other products that customers are using in various ways. But as we are clearing more menu going forward, we have a number of submissions in the foreseeable future now for this system as well, there will be a very similar ramp up of the – or the weighting will become very similar and also the consumables pull through will become more similar as well. In Europe, we’re offering the full menu, and where we are extremely strong is actually in the blood virals, hepatitis and HIV in addition to some of the esoteric testing panels that we are very well known for and we expect a similar picture to emerge in the United States as these assays become available. And would like to add to that, Cellestis will be for 2011, again, just to reconfirm that accretive by 2 to $0.03 on adjusted EPS, so we see there significant pick up in profitability once we have migrated them to our platform. 2012. Brigitte de Lima – Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks again. Peer Schatz 2012, Roland. Brigitte de Lima – Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yes 2012, yeah. Operator The next question is from Mr. Blum. Please state your name, your company name followed by your question. Holger Blum – Deutsche Bank Hi. Holger Blum from Deutsche Bank. Just three questions. First one on clarification on the HPV tender. Did you win the tender already or are they still to come? Second question would be on the reagent rental contract. Maybe you can give us some background here, what is the proportion of these kind of contracts today? And maybe you can say how that was two years ago and how it might be in two years’ time from now? And maybe if you can also from your perspective, share your thoughts on the MPV and these new contracts. Is it overall MPV neutral or if you have later on maybe high margins on the consumables. Or is it maybe still more negative or any kind of guidance there would be appreciated. Third question would be just on the – an update on the Abbott’s HIV Hepatitis C tests, when do you expect the launch there? How is a transformation progressing there? Thank you. Peer Schatz Yeah, thanks. Okay. The first question was regarding the tenders. Yeah, we don’t want to highlight any specific tender or give too much detail on. These are obviously competitive situations. But we were constantly winning tenders and also large ones and we wouldn’t be putting them in if there wouldn’t be a very high certainty that we have them or that we already have them. So we feel very confident in these projections. Holger Blum – Deutsche Bank Okay. Peer Schatz Number two is the reagent rental distribution. The reagent rentals were almost zero two years ago. We had very few reagent rentals. Today, on the QIAsymphony it’s more than half, it’s probably approaching three quarters. And at some point in time, I would say in two years out that number will probably go even higher. As I said in the last quarter, the reagent rentals are very good sign, because this means that the laboratory is actually willing to commit their own revenue stream to using this platform. If they just buy the system to play around with it, it’s a different story. If they buy the system and commit to using our assays, that means they are shifting their own revenue generation or services in other words to relying on our assays as well. But we’re very pleased with this pickup, and the NPVF this is very positive. So we’re putting in very conservative financial metrics getting quick paybacks of these systems and the consumables have a high degree of profitability. So these systems pay very quickly for themselves. Holger Blum – Deutsche Bank Okay. Last question was on your arrangement with Abbott and the HPV launch timeline? Peer Schatz Yeah. There is really nothing new to say on that. We’re in development right now on these assays and are moving forward to bring them forward to the market. We wanted to once we have the development plan fully laid out and also the regulatory pathway cleared. These assays are little more complex. We will come out with that on that, but I assume this would be – around our Analyst Day we’d be happy to give details on that. But it – definitely it remains a very important cornerstone of our assay portfolio that we see for the foreseeable future. Holger Blum – Deutsche Bank Okay. Good. Well, maybe last question, although it’s maybe a bit early for you to comment on it, would you dare to provide any kind of organic growth projection for 2012 or that’s too early at this stage, or do what you think is feasible? Peer Schatz I’d probably like to answer it this way that the current underlying performance is definitely not satisfactory and we are adapting the company to achieve also with the underlying business a better performance. We were talking about changes that we made to the channels, changes that we made to emerging regions, changes that we made to also some allocation of resources among the various customer classes. But what we’re doing on top of that while still a smaller percentage of our overall sales is moving ahead very nicely and I’d like to highlight the companion, our personalized medicine initiatives that we have and QIAsymphony rollout, and also the progress of our QIAensemble development program, which is moving on very nicely now in its new format, and going forward we think even further increase our competitiveness here. So a lot of things that are adding growth, inflection points now over the course of 2012 that we’re looking forward to generate. We had the first landmark submissions of KRAS as a companion diagnostic as I said before. You can expect a second one this week as well, and these things will hopefully provide a very good increased visibility of the growth opportunities that we have for 2012 that we will put into numbers when we give guidance for the full year. Holger Blum – Deutsche Bank Okay. Thank you. Peer Schatz Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Mr. Peterson. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan Yeah, it’s Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Peer, on your comments before the academic market, I think you also talked about accelerating your direct sales channels. Can you just talk a little bit more about what that entails? Peer Schatz Yeah. Thanks, Tycho. That definitely is an important trend. What we’re seeing right now is that we have to aware in the academic markets that the majority of the academic customers, I’d say 80% or so probably never even see a sales person. And even largest players in the space have only a limited reach or touch points into their effective customers. So what most people are exploring right now and we’ve really taken a very strong and may be in some cases call it a leading position and is exploring how to increase the number of touch points into academic customers using novel techniques, it’s not only electronic, it’s also using call centers and similar. And these services are being received very positively by our customers. And we started that much more actively last year and we always had an insight sales activities much more refined and mandate. And we started that early this year and are continuing ramp it up as we see the market shifting. And there is definitely a shift in the academic markets and it needs a change in response and this is – we’re responding to it. Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan And then on may be just shifting over to QIAsymphony are you able to talk it all about what percentage of the systems that are out there have been competitive wins? Or alternatively upgrades to existing instruments it’s got to be one or the other presumably? Roland Sackers Yeah, I’d say almost all of them are competitive because they typically are dense retenders and or at least to a comparative process. And so I think, it’d be very rare to say that there is – we obviously have many extremely loyal clients and customers who are extremely valuable often to us where we’ve been – would have a natural upgrade. But the majority are clearly looking at whatever might be considered a competitive system in the marketplace, but we have been providing very, very clear wins. And the win rate has been very impressive. This is also reflected, if you look at some of the numbers of these systems out there. They are typically – after five years, 10 years or so to be in the several hundred maybe a little bit over thousand. And we in a very short period of time are now approaching 500 systems, it just shows that there is a significant adoption that we’re getting here and it definitely is a sweet spot in the market. What we need now is, for the assay pull-through to come through for the money to expand on these systems and that will generate very substantial returns for them. But we’re currently in investment phase of this rollout. Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan Okay. And then the comments on China were a little bit surprising around the molecular diagnostic business. Can you just elaborate on – I know it’s a nascent market for you, but what the underlying dynamics are there? Roland Sackers Yeah. While we have a very strong activity in China and the market is definitely growing, but we had more hopes for the Chinese market because we made substantial investments in 2010 to create a clinical sales channel. The clinical sales channel very comparable to what we have here in the United States is creating demand for in particular HPV testing. But also other assays that we have in the portfolio we have a number of SAP approved assays in China. Just expanded the portfolio actually in the first half of the year again quite considerably. So there was a hope that this clinical sales channel, which would provide similar gross stimuli to the underlying business then we’ve seen here in the United States typically have effect. And this was a little bit slower. It has to do with the way that the Chinese market works. It was absolutely the right decision to do. And we expect to reap the benefits of this clinical sales channel, future period, but it didn’t come as fast as we originally thought. And then the focus and attention that we put on to this distracted it from other areas made the growth a little bit more subdued in the MDx market. So we didn’t typically see the 30, 40% growth than we typically see in this market. We saw similar in the life sciences, but in the MDx area we see what – seeing what we think is a temporary dip in that growth rate, which would – should reemerge. Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan Okay. Then last one on HPV, I understand you don’t want to give a lot of color on the tenders. But is there any change in kind of dynamic around pricing terms, duration of contracts, technology out clauses, other aspects that you’re hearing about the market? Roland Sackers Sure. Well, the market – actually our revenues HPV grew in the North America in the second quarter. So it came from very soft performance in the first quarter into growth in the second quarter. We have actually been very successful in the full light of a – of competitive products from strong companies, been able to climb and extend and expand dozens of contracts again in the first half of this year. And we see a very strong competitive profile increasingly emerging. Now this is helped by a number of things. First of all our platform expansions, so called QIAensemble, the evolution program, which I think is a little bit underestimated in public view, but I think if you talk to laboratories you see that the addition of these modules that we put on to the existing Rapid Capture system make this a very, very competitive workflow. And the – and that going forward is creating a good opportunity for us to continue our very strong competitive position. There is one thing that I’d like to highlight as well, you know, we had some recent very important announcements last week on the IOM, that decided to add HPV testing to a Preventive Services Task Force list. And this basically would remove co-payment, or in other words significantly reduce or eliminate the link to economic trends. But I don’t want to overplay, but this is an extremely important decision that was made by the IOM, obviously an extremely important body that decided to come out to support this. So going forward starting 2013, when this will affect the co-payments, we’ll probably even start early as insurance companies are starting to move over to accept these new standards. We’ll remove co-payment from HPV testing detaching it then from economic trends and making it a much more robust and independent and reliable revenue stream. The interesting thing is that the focused areas on negative predicted value, which really only QIAGEN can prove in long-term studies. And it focuses on HPV DNA based testing and clearly also limiting a technology that has been applied. So, there are a number of very important trends that are working for us here and we’re actively also shaping this market. Tycho Peterson – JP Morgan Okay. Thank you. Roland Sackers Thanks, Tycho. Operator The next question is from Mr. Welford. Please state your name, company name and your question. Peter Welford – Jefferies Hi, it’s Peter Welford from Jefferies. Two questions. Firstly, just going to the applied testing, as interestingly you comment about weak instrument sales, I wanted to give us some more visibility on why in particular applied testing you think you’re seeing a slowdown in instrument placements there. And then, perhaps secondly then, just looking at the reagent rental agreements, do you put in place for these agreements minimum purchase requirements for the customers and how do they – how do you, I guess lock in the customers for those agreements, or is it a moment relatively flexible given the early stage of the roll-out of these products. Thank you. Peer Schatz Thanks. Good questions. Second one is the minimum number of sales. Yes there is a contractual commitment that the client gives in terms of assay or consumable pull-through or revenue pull-through to Qiagen. So that is the underlying dream that we use for our financial analysis and it’s based on commitments. Number two is the applied testing automation growth that I would attribute more to timing and to year-over-year effect. The applied testing team is moving ahead very nicely. We’re seeing very good trends in this space and we expect them to make or exceed their target. So this also includes the instrumentation components that are working very nicely for them, as they are also leveraging the QIAsymphony, RGQ and components. Peter Welford – Jefferies That’s great, thank you. Peer Schatz Thanks. Dr. Solveigh Mähler And with this I would like to close the conference call by thanking you all for participating. We hope to welcome you again to our third quarter 2011 earnings conference call on Thursday, November 03, 2011. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

With this, I would now like to hand over to Peer Schatz.  Thank you.  Peer? Peer Schatz Yeah.  Thank you, Solveigh.  I would like to welcome all of you to our conference call and the opportunity to discuss our results for the third quarter of 2011 and also for the first nine months of the year. As you saw in our release last night, we delivered moderate sales growth in the third quarter, however fully in line with our targets.  And we also exceeded our goal for adjusted EPS.  We achieved these results against the backdrop of the expected challenging business environment one that has not improved so far during the course of 2011. We have reaffirmed our sales expectation for 2011 and expanded our adjusted EPS target.  Achieving our sales target is important for us to be able to accelerate full year sales growth in 2012, compared to 2011. Our sales in the third quarter were up 1% at a constant exchange rate and rose 5% on a reported basis.  We were particularly pleased with the double-digit growth in Europe, Asia Pacific, and Japan.  The first time consolidation of Cellestis and Ipsogen also supported our performance. Instrument sales were up 8% on a constant exchange rate basis.  This was driven by targeted initiatives across our broad portfolio.  A key focus is obviously, the ongoing global rollout of QIAsymphony and the demand from customers for this modular platform that is setting new standards for automation.  For QIAsymphony, we are starting to see more of the positive impact from the shift to reagent rental agreements. Our revenues are recognized on a pro rata basis over the time of these multiyear contracts that began earlier this year.  While this is not fully reflected in sales for the current period, it increases sales in future periods. So, we are very pleased with the rollout, which we have said involves a long selling cycle.  We are on track to reach more than 550 installed systems by the end of 2011, and we are only in the early years of this decade long product cycle. Among the customer classes, the strongest contributions came from Academia and Pharma.  Now this may seem surprising given industry commentary on the uncertain academic funding environment and Pharma industry cost cutting, while we saw major benefits from various marketing and sales efforts. In Molecular Diagnostics, in addition to contributions from QIAsymphony, higher sales were achieved in profiling, where our products are used for instance viral load testing and personalized healthcare where we are strengthening our leadership position in companion diagnostics. Prevention sales were down.  And as we said on our last call due in part to the timing of a national tender deliver for HPV test.  This tender is now confirmed for the first fourth quarter of 2011.  So Molecular Diagnostics should see a stronger growth in the last quarter this year. HPV test sales were also lower in the U.S.  As we have said in the past, we are taking actions to solidify our leadership and this has included closing multiyear contracts with our customers in improving automation for our gold standard testing solutions.  We will discuss this point later. Moving on to our strategic initiatives.  We have been saying 2011 is a transition year as we build our portfolio of Molecular content and rollout QIAsymphony.  These actions will create growth opportunities in 2012 and beyond.  This progress is reflected in the milestones that our teams have achieved to drive our platform success with our automated systems, add content to our platforms, broaden our geographic presence, and grow efficiently and effectively. We have been very active in personalized healthcare.  In the United States, we completed the second of our two submissions for our KRAS biomarker test.  Each submission pairs this biomarker with a medicine for treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.  FTA decision times on pre-market approval submission or PMAs are usually about 12 months.  So we anticipate receiving decisions by mid 2012. These are important achievements to-date from our more than 15 co-development projects underway with major pharmaceutical companies.  In fact, we also added two new projects in the third quarter with existing partners Eli Lilly and Pfizer.  I will talk more about these projects later. The acquisitions of Cellestis and Ipsogen also provided contributions for the first time.  We are pleased with our performances, and the integration processes are moving ahead quickly. In summary, we met our sales target for the third quarter, and beat our adjusted EPS target, and are reaffirming our expectations.  We are clearly not growing yet at the level that we believe is satisfactory, but our strategic initiatives are on track.  They will help us deliver on our targets for 2011 and grow at a faster pace in 2012. Before we get into more depth, I would like to hand over to Roland for a discussion on the financials.  Roland? Roland Sackers Yes, thank you Peer, and good afternoon to everyone in Europe, and good morning to those joining from the U.S.  The third quarter of 2011 for QIAGEN have been largely as expected, delivering on our targets for net sales, but meeting our goals for adjusted EPS. Recapping the key numbers.  Net sales in the third quarter was 5% and it was 1% at constant exchange rate to US$288.9 million over the third quarter of 2010.  As Peer mentioned, instrument sales were up 8% constant exchange rates, whereas consumers and related revenues were flat. Looking at this from a customer class perspective, we had higher contributions from Academia and Pharma, which however will offset the Molecular Diagnostics for the reasons Peer described before. Moving below net sales, the adjusted gross profit margin remained relatively flat, despite higher instrument sales as adjusted gross profit increased 5% from approximately US$207 million. SG&A expenses were up 50% over the third quarter.  We are making investments as a whole out of QIAsymphony.  This initiative is targeting customers in Molecular Diagnostics, as well in clinical research in Academia and Pharma.  We are also seeing good interest from Applied Testing customer. Adjusted operating income was down slightly to approximately US$75 million from about US$79 million in the third quarter of 2010.  Key factors were sales and marketing investments to globalize the Cellestis and Ipsogen portfolio, following there recent acquisition, as well as investments in the emerging markets of India and Taiwan that QIAGEN holds direct operations in 2011.  So we are still executing on our mid-term operating leverage program and have a goal of 31% or better by the end of 2013.  And we will give you more insights on this topic at our upcoming investor event. Moving further down, the income statement, financial income was higher in the third quarter of 2011, as we benefited from the changing interest rate environment.  Other income was also higher and the reported results included a one-time currency gain of about US$10milloin that was recognized as part of Cellestis acquisition.  But this amount was excluded from our adjusted net income and EPS figures. This slide obviously can be volatile and it has swung between a loss of about $2 million to an income of about $3 million in 2010 and 2011, and this has mainly been driven by foreign currency movements.  For modeling purposes, you should consider a slightly positive contribution of US$500,000 third quarter and a bandwidth up and down of $2 million from this figure. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.24 per share in the third quarter compared to $0.25 in the same period of 2010.  Remember that we had indicated dilution of about $0.03 per share to full year adjusted EPS due to planned sales and R&D investments in Cellestis and Ipsogen after the acquisition. We had been anticipating about $0.02 of dilution in the third quarter and about $0.01 in the fourth quarter.  Although the overall impact has not changed, this has been inverse.  I mean here that we had about $0.01 in the third quarter and we now anticipate about $0.02 in the fourth quarter. In summary, the third quarter for QIAGEN was largely as expected in terms of sales and they surpassed our adjusted EPS target. I am now on slide 6.  We were particularly pleased with the double-digit expansion in the Asia Pacific, Japan region, and also in the Europe, Middle East Africa region.  The Asia Pacific and Japan region returned to its role as a strong growth contributor, recovering nicely from the disrupted events earlier this year. Net sales was 90% in constant exchange rate and gains were seen in all customer classes.  In particular China returned to a stronger growth profile, it’s contributions for Molecular Diagnostics and Life Sciences.  Japan demonstrated solid gains across all customer classes as well.  We saw so strong demand in particular in Forensics. In the EMEA region, where sales rose 50% constant exchange rates, we are seeing solid growth in Molecular Diagnostics, particularly for our QIAsymphony platform, since we have a very broad menu in this region. So we are seeing strong demand for the automation platform and also rising consumers flow through levels, as customers become more and more accustomized to it’s benefits.  The benefits are becoming increasingly apparent to customers about what our platform really can offer in terms of laboratory automation and workflow consolidation. Academia grew at a single digit pace in Europe with expansion particularly driven by the northern region despite increasing overall pressures from the implementation of government authority measures.  Finally, in Southern Europe, we continue to face a number of forces working against us, but other areas are more than offsetting this modest impact. The temporary distortion of results for the Americas where sales were down 12% constant exchange rates overshadows the important contributions from other areas of our business. As we mentioned earlier, this regional decline was due mainly to the timing of a national HPV tender outside the U.S. and also by weaker HPV sales in the U.S.  As noted earlier, we expect better results in the Americas in Molecular Diagnostics in the fourth quarter of this year. Pharma delivered solid growth in the U.S., while Academia sales were slightly higher but still impacted by budget concerns.  This ongoing uncertainty over NIH budget in 2012 remains a key issue in the U.S. This discretionary budget cuts in the U.S. are having an effect on grant funding rates.  We believe, this will be continue to have a direct impact on some of our customers in the U.S., until we get greater clarity on budgets. Moving on to slide 7, I would like to provide some comments on our financial position after the first nine months of 2011.  As of September 30, our group liability stands at US$486 million.  Our equity ratio is at 65% and our leverage is now at about one times net debt to adjusted EBIDTA. Free cash flow for the first nine months in 2011 was approximately US$109 million compared to approximately US$108 million in the same period of 2010. For the third quarter, free cash flow was US$42 million and this was down from US$66 million in the third quarter of 2010.  Free cash flow in the third quarter was affected by higher inventories.  We are now relocating some manufacturing activities to our site in Hilden, Germany, after completing construction project.  Another factor that broadened our cash flow was the impact of contract to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure. I would now like to hand back to Peer for a strategy update. Peer Schatz Yeah, thank you, Roland, and we are now on slide eight.  I would like to provide some perspectives on the performance of our four customer classes. Molecular Diagnostics, which represented 46% of net sales in the quarter, declined 5% on a constant exchange rate basis.  As we mentioned, earlier we saw strong instrument sales particularly from the Global QIAsymphony rollout, and also growth in Profiling and Personalized Healthcare, while prevention was lower due to the reduced HPV contributions in the Americas. Applied Testing, which provides 7% of net sales, has been facing a similar situation during 2011, double-digit growth in consumable, but weak instrument sales, which can be very volatile.  This resulted in steady year-on-year sales.  A key growth driver remains human identification in forensics, where we are benefiting from new European standards.  We also have one national police tenders in Eastern Europe and Asia.  In food safety and veterinary we are obtaining approvals for our food and veterinary assays particularly for use on QIAsymphony. I would like review Academia and Pharma together, since we are seeing some similar trends.  Compared to the first half of 2011, we saw solid growth in both customer classes with Pharma up 6% on a constant exchange rate basis, and Academia growing 7%.  A key driver was our decision to step up the expansion of our direct marketing channels; I know they are trying touch points to our customers.  We have also launched initiatives putting a stronger emphasis on science based selling and in particular on our range of products for cancer research from basic research to translational medicine and then drug discovery and development. We are pleased with these results, but the overall environment remains challenging.  In Academia, increasing budget pressure is affecting buying patterns among customers.  And in Pharma although we are benefiting from sustained demand from Molecular technologies, you can see from recent announcements that many pharmaceutical companies are intensifying their cost containment measures.  But we are going to intensify our focus on growth initiatives in these customer classes, particularly Academia given the strategic importance as an innovation driver.  And we anticipate these customer classes to provide single digit constant exchange rate sales growth in the fourth quarter this year. Moving to the next slide, we are making good progress on our strategic initiatives, all of which are supporting our objective to leverage our leadership in sample and assay technologies across our four customer classes.  First and foremost we want to drive platform success underpinned by the rollout of our flagship platform QIAsymphony worldwide.  Our top priority remains increased placements and improve the utility of this instrument with an expanded menu. We are in the early stages of a platform and content story that will play out over the next five to ten years.  This will lead to increasing sales growth as we expand the menu of assays available for use on a growing installed base.  The full version QIAsymphony RGQ, which includes pre-modular elements for sample preparation, assay setup, and real-time PCR detection with a Rotor-Gene RGQ, was launched at the end of 2010, so about a year ago, and we are pleased with the uptake.  We anticipate reaching an installed base of more than 550 installed systems worldwide by the end of 2011.  We are also seeing strong growth in demand for consumables used on this system.  Every placement creates an opportunity for annual consumable sales or so-called pull through of anywhere between $30,000 and $300,000. We already have a number of customers with annual consumable levels well above $100,000 to $150,000.  These types of initial results, particularly given that the full version was launched only in late 2010 in Europe, and early 2011 in the U.S., gives us confidence about the longer-term substantial growth potential. In addition to QIAsymphony, keep in mind that we are also selling more than 600 new Rotor-Gene RGQ real-time PCR platforms every year and there are already more than 6,000 of these platforms around the world.  Customers using these Rotor-Gene RGQ systems are natural targets for QIAsymphony and replacing manual steps or the use of our other platforms. The majority of QIA symphony placements in the first wave are with customers who are adding modules.  So, in other words, creating a full QIAsymphony RGQ system.  But full off-the-shelf system sales have been jumping significantly as well.  We are not aware of any other competitor offering such a broad range of instruments to meet diverse customer needs and then combining this with an extensive testing manual.  We will provide more insights on QIAsymphony at our Investor Event on November 17,   at the AMP meeting in Dallas. I would like to now spend some time reviewing how Cellestis and Ipsogen underpin the strategic initiatives, and also provide an update on our perspectives about HPVN initiatives to strengthen our leadership in personalized healthcare. Moving to the next slide Cellestis and Ipsogen fully support our strategic initiative to add content.  We completed the full acquisition of Cellestis in late August and QuantiFERON TB Gold; a breakthrough in detecting latent tuberculosis has been delivering uninterrupted strong growth.  Key drivers in the third quarter was a sales expansion in the U.S, Europe, and Japan.  We are making investments to quickly address new markets and drive global expansion.  We are already investing into sales and marketing initiatives and are planning new R&D projects to develop tests that would detect latent diseases and mirror some of the molecular diagnostic tests that are used in patients with active diseases. The market potential we are now targeting is the use of QuantiFERON TB Gold as a companion diagnostic to test patients for latent TB status before being prescribed certain medicines.  We are launching a new campaign targeting rheumatologists who prescribed TNF alpha blocking medicines.  It is well known that the risk of latent TB reactivating significantly greater when using these types of medicines.  So we are adding sales and marketing resources to target this opportunity. Turning to Ipsogen, we now hold approximately 72% of the shares and launched a tender to fully acquire the leader in blood cancer diagnostics.  In fact, the most important post-acquisition progress was the agreement with Eli Lilly to develop a companion diagnostic for the JAK2 biomarker, for which Ipsogen has worldwide exclusive license and a great assay portfolio.  We anticipate reaching more co-development agreements for Ipsogen biomarker portfolio as well. Also, of note, was the fact that this JAK2 test Ipsogen’s JAK2 test was chosen in July by the myeloproliferative disorders research consortium to assess mutation loads in two international multicenter trials supported by the National Cancer Institute and Roche Pharma.  Key growth drivers are the flagship JAK2 and BCR-ABL biomarker   tests.  Ipsogen has been seeking to accelerate its expansion beyond Europe and the U.S., and our global operations provide an excellent infrastructure for that.  We are also now working on U.S. submission strategies. I’m now on slide 11.  On HPV, we wanted to frame the discussion to explain how we are addressing market dynamics in various parts of the world.  As you know, the relative contribution of HPV to total sales has declined in recent years due to strong growth in our profiling and personalized healthcare portfolio.  It was about 20% of total sales in the first nine months of 2011 and this is down from about 25% for the same period in 2008. This is also reflected in the geographic breakdown.  About 15% of our total sales came from HPV in the United States in the first nine months of 2011, and this is down from about 20% for the same period in 2008.  We are providing this new level of disclosure, since we believe the market is overestimating the contributions of HPV in the United States to our business. We also see HPV as having a broader strategic role to QIAGEN.  It has been key in riding the expansion of our overall molecular diagnostics initiatives.  In fact, we generated about 25% of our total company sales from non-HPV areas of molecular diagnostics, so significantly more than the HPV area in the first nine months of 2011, and this is up from about 19% in 2008.  So, HPV is providing great critical mass to get more phase time with our customers. I want to make it clear that we are not talking about bundling but instead maximizing the value of customer relations built up over the years since we entered molecular diagnostics.  We have been talking about HPV initiatives for some time.  Driving market conversion remains paramount.  The recently announced guideline changes are positive for us in many ways. They favor HPV Papco testing and they have put a clinical counterweight against some marketing driven initiatives pushing genotyping for a very small subset of patients. We have been successful in signing many customers to new multiyear contracts stressing the many benefits of our Hybrid Capture 2 Tests as well as the risks and costs switching. This could be accomplished with only very moderate pricing concessions and this would continue into 2012 but this was to be expected.  Customers are also told us that they were very pleased with the rapid capture system the Hybrid Capture 2 Test and again still the proven gold standard but want us to improve automation. So, we are launching the Decapper unit during the second half of this year and working on automation initiatives. Outside of the United States we also have a high market share with more than 20 competitors.  We are working to convert markets to primary screening either from Pap test or even just to implement cervical cancer screening at all.  In Europe, we have a leading market share and have won a number of pilots in regional tenders across the continent. These pilots and tenders are done as part of the selection process to implement national screening programs. The decisions on national programs are long-term processes and can’t be delayed and impacted by macroeconomic conditions. During the third quarter, we for instance won an additional large tender for European country. We are well-positioned in a number of markets to move quickly if decisions are made on national implementation and we are working with authorities. Primary screening in Mexico using our Hybrid Capture 2 Test has been a major achievement.  We are addressing opportunities across Latin America as well as in the Asia Pacific region.  These involves our Hybrid Capture 2 Test as well as the lower resource version so called Care HPV which we believe is a commercially viable product to complete a critical role in preventing the burden of cervical cancer. Turning to the next slide, Slide 12, we have already discussed the new biomarker project with Eli Lilly involving JAK2.  We also recently announced a new project with Pfizer that builds on our existing projects for the KRAS biomarker. We have projects on this biomarker with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Lilly for Erbitux and Amgen for Vectibix.  These submissions, as you know, were completed in the third quarter for use of this biomarker paired with these medicines in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.  We are expanding the market potential for the KRAS biomarker with this new project with Pfizer since it involves patients being treated for non-small cell lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers and it is the leading cause of cancer related mortality in both men and women in the United States and throughout the world. This is only a portion of our project we have over 15 underway but many are confidential and we cannot and would like not to disclose details we are working on many new opportunities and have more to come. I would now like to hand back to Roland. Roland Sackers Yeah, thank you, Peer. I am on slide 13.  We had updated our expectations for 2011 when we published half year results in July.  The sectors we noted were the impact of Cellestis Exciton acquisition as well as ongoing changing market conditions, and then also due to the impact of the timing for the HPV tender.  We are reaffirming the sales targets provided in July and we have expanded the adjusted EPS range for the second half of 2011 and the full year. For the first quarter of 2011, total sales growth is expected to be approximately 40% at constant exchange rate.  Molecular diagnostics is expected to be much higher than this rate including contributions from the national HPV tender and we are expecting single digit sales growth contributions from the other customer classes.  For the full year, we continue to expect total sales growth of approximately 3% constant exchange rate with contributions from organic growth and acquisition.  We have also updated our foreign currency exemptions for this period which we anticipate to continue to provide a positive effect on net sales. In terms of adjusted EPS, we have expanded our previous target of approximately $0.96 to a range of about $0.96 to $0.97, and we have done the same with our target for the second half of 2011 with a range of $0.53 to $0.54.  For the first quarter our target is now $0.29 and this effect is updated acquisition impact of shifting of about $0.02 for the fourth quarter, as I had mentioned earlier. Turning to the next slide, in terms of adjustments to operating income, we expect equity based compensation of about $4 million to $5 million for the first quarter, amortization of acquired IP of approximately US $28 million and business integration acquisition and restructuring of about US$7 million.  This is higher than we had forecasted on our July call but is again due to the timing of our acquisition related charges.  The full year impact remains unchanged. Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 25% which was actually higher than the 22% rate for the same quarter in 2010, and for the first quarter we expect the adjusted tax rate in the range of 22 to 24%.  For the full year, this would imply a range of about 23% to 25%. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding will be around 237 million for the first quarter and 239 million for the full year 2011.  Peer? Peer Schatz Thank you, Roland. I am now the summary slide before we move into Q&A.  As I mentioned at the start, although our growth is not where we wanted to be nor how we foresee it to develop in the future, we met our targets for the third quarter of 2011 in a challenging environment and against timing trends from large transaction and prevention tenders, and from development milestones for companion diagnostic projects. It is important to see the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives. We are creating a foundation for future growth led by the ongoing strong roll out of QIAsymphony and our initiatives to add content to our portfolio, both through internal R&D as well as through targeted acquisitions of Cellestis and Exciton.  And we have reaffirmed our full year guidance supported by a stronger growth profile in the second half of the year. We are also on track to achieve our targets for the fourth quarter. In closing, we have shown with our performance in the third quarter that we are expanding QIAGEN in 2011 and ready to accelerate growth in 2012. And with that, I would like to hand back to Mähler to open up the Q&A session. Thank you. Solveigh Mähler Yeah, thank you very much, Peer. We are now looking forward to discussing our question.  I would like to open the Q&A session by handing over to the operator. Jason? Question-and-Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions).  One moment for the first question please.  The first question comes from Mr. Lai. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Matt Notarianni - Robert W. Baird Good morning. This is actually Matt in for Quinn Lai at Robert W. Baird.  Starting with kind of the commentary about seeing accelerating growth in to 2012, I was wondering, Peer, if maybe you could help add some color to kind of what you are assuming by end market or maybe kind of the volume dynamics that you might be expecting, just little extra color there? Peer Schatz The majority of these impacts come from the year-over-year effects that we had seen in 2011 especially against the backdrop of the continuing slide in physician utilization rate in the US and also the move to reagent rental models and the roll out of the QIAsymphony systems.  So, this is kind of more from the year-over-year and comparative level.  We saw slower growth in automation as we had seen in the prior year also due to the reagent rentals we also had some the underlying shifts to this end in the physician utilization rates.  So, those things should wash out and over the course of 2012 as they seem to be in a more stable as we have seen in the first half of this year.  So, that is certainly the major effects that would give us some tailwinds into 2012. We continue to expect the challenging markets in the academic and pharmaceutical arenas even though our more company specific related initiatives around our clinical research package and packages in pharmaceutical, molecular development supporting solutions are seeing very dynamic growth, and we've been quite successful in also linking those into diagnostic franchises that we have.  So that, as you know, is our part of our core strategy. So, those are the mix that should continue to boost the top line into 2012.  We remain concerned about the general market environment but we see year-over-year effects and certain company specific effects giving us more tailwinds in 2012. Matt Notarianni - Robert W. Baird Great, thanks for that color.  And then just wanted to kind of dive in on the academic since you really are kind of an outlier with the sort of growth that you have reported here given the uncertainty, anything special in terms of whether you're hearing from the field, customer tone, has it ebbed and flowed kind of throughout the quarter given some of the uncertainty out there? Thanks. Peer Schatz It definitely is a -- the market has seen quite some challenges right now.  And as we know in the United States the budget situation has proven to be a little bit more favorable in 2012 than some people feared but 2013 doesn’t look too good.  However, we should never forget that the US academic budgets, we are talking tens of billions of dollars, the NIH budget alone is $10 billion and now we have half a percent of that.  And so, the ability to grow in this market is not a factor of the overall market growth. It is certainly influenced by that accelerated or impeded by that, but there remain a lot of growth pockets within the overall academic markets. In Europe, it’s very similar, so we see strong funding growth in countries like Germany, and very difficult funding situations in Southern Europe and also the UK.  So, I think there is no real expectation for the funding challenges to go away over the future.  However, we seem to be very well-positioned because contrary to most other suppliers to the academic markets we have been focusing on the clinical application, so being very close to the patient and very close to clinical research and leveraging our ability to transition into diagnostic products.  A system like QIAsymphony, for instance, is also going into some academic and pharmaceutical customer areas simply because it can transition into a more controlled and regulated environment and provide a certain degree of quality. And so that is indicative of the type of positioning we are taking in these markets. And those clinical sub-segments are seeing somewhat better growth in the overall just blue sky basis research area.  And, I think the few ways of validating that is you see a lot of initiatives being published by government to think about creating clinical development activities within academic research and focusing more on partnering to get innovation actually into utility for patients. Operator Ladies and gentleman, please reduce your questions to one so that we can let all participants who would like to ask question take part. The next question comes from Mr. Bonello.  Please state your name, company name follow-up by your question. Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets Thank you. Bill Bonello with RBC Capital Markets. Hey, I am just wondering if you could tell us so that we can get a sense as non-HPV becomes more and more important, what is the organic growth in the quarter was on the non-HPV component of the molecular diagnostics business?  And maybe along with that you could tell us what organic growth would have looked like if you hadn’t had the HPV tender issue? Peer Schatz Yes, that goes into quite some detail, Bill, and although I will try to answer it a few ways.  First the HPV tender was majority of the difference between the growth and non-growth, and so the gap was basically this tender area.  We have seen very good growth in the Profiling and PHC areas.  We said before that Personalized Healthcare is now growing at 40% clip.  And this is not, some people say this is a time we have got three year out business.  This is actually very real.  We are talking quite significant numbers near-term and we were talking about high double-digit million dollars of sales that we are already generating in this area, and this is continuing to grow quite nicely. The Profiling area is one where we are seeing also very strong double-digit growth rates in the assay sales.  However because a lot of these placements are now under reagent rental people are bundling the modules that they buy to synthesize there QIAsymphony RGQ or combine the complete RGQ under reagent rental contracts, and thereby we are not getting the instruments sales, which we partly got in 2010 from other instruments for instance. So the growth in the reagents continue to be a very high double-digit numbers.  I wouldn’t want to go into more specifics on this at this point in time and maybe something that we could split out on an annual basis. Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets That’s very helpful.  But in general even with your comment on the instrument comparison, which is a bit of a just, as you go forward that growth will look different.  I mean in general it sounds like we should think of the non-HPV component of Molecular Diagnostics, as even if it’s growing, at least in the high single-digits or certainly growing at least? Peer Schatz Absolutely, absolutely and this was also visible as over the last few years as HPV was actually not a big growth driver, not a growth driver at all.  We were using this as a critical mass space to develop our overall Molecular Diagnostics franchise, and have been able to diversify the portfolio quite successfully, which is today, actually quite a broad portfolio across many different disease areas and types of testing.  And this has really been our vision over the future.  And so the HPV component went from 20% of our sales base down to 15% and is probably over the future even as we continue efforts to covert markets and drive growth in this area, is probably going to be a lower growth area than PHC and our Personalized Healthcare and Profiling. Operator The next question comes from Mr. Leonard.  Please state your name, company name followed by your question. Dan Leonard - Leerink Swann Thank you, Dan Leonard here from Leerink Swann.  My one question of your parent role and obviously you are looking to drive margin leverage in the business through 2013 and appreciating will get more information at the Analyst Day conceptually how much of this leverage assumption is dependent on assumptions for rapid expansion of sales growth versus how much can you actually achieve if sales growth is more moderate, say in maybe a mid single-digit type of range and what will be the drivers? Peer Schatz Thanks Dan, great question.  Roland, do you want to take that one? Roland Sackers Yeah, sure. Hi, Dan.  If you look at our P&L and just looking at our operational expense number, I think you clearly see that we have a significant possibility to leverage operational expenses here at QIAGEN.  Also looking backwards we clearly did so and the one thing you have to have in mind, we just closed on two large acquisitions.  This clearly also had a short-term impact on our ability to leverage, nevertheless I would believe already in the fourth quarter and for sure in 2012 we will make significant steps forward from the Q3 guidance, which I would call very untypical.  And I believe especially around SG&A we have significant leverage opportunities and the -- our comfort zone is somewhere between around 11% of total revenues, investments. So I feel quite comfortable with achieving our target in that given time period.  We will give on the Analyst Day more time, actually more insight in the different initiatives we started and give also benchmark to you.  As you know we started certain initiatives around logistics, around certain outsourcing activities, and this is clearly helping us going forward into a very significant way. In addition to that, also in general, we still had in a majority of all business over the last couple of years I don’t think that there is difference going forward.  Also around pricing we were able to achieve the significant pricing opportunities that is going to continue and last but not least in terms of utilization wise, in terms of production, we still are wanting right now another typical leverage utilization rate of 65%, we just spent more volume going forward, we should be able to leverage on that as well.  And clearly also makes more molecular less last time transient growth rate, it’s also going to help us proceeding our margin sales and growth here over the next three years. Operator The next question comes from Mr. Peterson.  Please state your name, company name followed by your question. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan It’s Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan.  Maybe starting out with QIAsymphony here in the U.S., I’m just wondering if you can give a little bit more color on some of the uptake patterns, I think, in the past you’ve talked about may be half of the reagent rental, half CapEx sales and obviously it’s split between Molecular Diagnostics and Academia.  So, any color you can provide on some of the dynamics there, and to what degree you’re getting competitive swap outs as well? Peer Schatz Sure.  By far the majority of the placements are in clinical areas and followed by applied testing, which has also seen some success with.  We will have new packages on the QIAsymphony call coming forward for forensic applications next year.  And so, that will probably see stronger growth, also in instrumentation sales it was little weaker this year in some cases in anticipation of that.  By far the majority of the placements are in the clinical area.  And the placements in Europe where we have enough assays to be able to generate the reagent pull through are all most all in reagent rentals, which is actually great news out of the box.  As I said in the recent call, that people put their faith in the system and are willing to commit to multiyear reagent rental contracts.  Primarily, in the area of HIV and Hepatitis, but also in the area of Esoteric testing, and even in some cases Homebrew Reagents.  So, in the United States it’s there is some packaging around ASRs that people are using and also Homebrew Reagents, and clearly as some of the assays are moving to the clinic and toward submission, and in anticipation of that, we expect a much stronger reagent rental opportunity.  But, so it’s almost all of them in Europe and less than the majority in the States. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan And then with regards to HPV, I appreciate the fact you have gone back and locked up a lot of your contracts.  I mean are you hearing from yours customers interesting kind of the bundling dynamic and the idea that HPV will be done with chlamydia gonorrhea and taken other tests.  How do you respond to that?  Obviously, you will have those tests -- some of those tests with [indiscernible] (00:47:39) maybe not trip some many gonorrhea, but how do you deal with that in the near-term? Peer Schatz Yeah, the majority of the add-on tests are actually quite easy to develop and not really differentiate products.  And there are several suppliers or there will be several suppliers offering these additional tests as well.  So, it’s very difficult to differentiate on committee on freak in the future.  I think it all has to do with the – with the solution offering that you are giving to the customer, for a lot of customers in the higher throughput area.  Most of the systems are matched out anyway and the cost of switching is just quite significant especially if they are thinking about moving to a system, which has different workflows or also different analytes that are being used. So, the switching costs are quite significant for any customer over the next few years, until alternatives systems are established.  We are providing a gold standard highly validated solution that has shown clinical superiority in terms of being able to detect diseases significantly above the potential and existing competition.  And so, from that prospective customers feel quite good about running this system, which is running in the high volumes and therefore utilizing the instrument basis that they have on site right now quite well.  If you are very comfortable doing that also there is some foreseeable future. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan Last one on capital deployment.  Any comments here given where the stocks and any change in strategy, and overall what you view as kind of the optimal capital structure well for the business? Peer Schatz Roland, do you want to take that one? Roland Sackers Yes sure.  Also yeah we will give a more detail update on our capital allocation policy on investor event.  You probably are aware also on our recent Analyst General Meeting we asked for approval to do a share buyback.  We got an approval of up to 10% and we will give more details, and certainly our thinking on our investor event. Operator The next question comes from Mr. Quirk.  Please state your name, company name followed by your question. Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray Thanks. Bill Quirk, Piper Jaffray.  Question for Peer given this as the timing of the tender and ebbs and flows of academic research funding we certainly understand that the North America business had a lot of gives and takes this quarter.  If we simply exclude HPV was the business positive in terms of constant exchange rates?  And then secondly, give us any color thinking to what the selective business contributions going forward?  Thank you. Peer Schatz Okay, well, first part of the question I’ll take and the second one Roland if you would take that one.  The trends are as we talked a little bit in the prepared remarks have been actually quite good also in Academia based on some of our initiatives in Pharma, and we have also seen good trends in molecular diagnostics.  And so, the answer is yes we are seeing growth also in the United States, and excluding these onetime effects and the year-over-year effects of the physician office visit decline.  So, it’s not where we wanted to be but in certain pockets we have seen very high growth and those are some of our strategic areas, such as the profile of the QIAsymphony rollouts and personalized healthcare have been doing extremely well. We have -- we're also are very pleased with the growth of the blood cancer profiling portfolio that Ipsogen is now soon to bring to our franchise, has been doing very well.  It’s something we are very excited about.  Also, as we can now put it onto our platforms, and as we know this assay is already validated for our systems.  And Cellestis has shown some breakthrough standardization achievements in terms of becoming the standard assay to be used in latent TB testing in several guidelines, in major counties we heard about Germany, as I think a lot of you have heard about.  Also, the new guidelines that have come up in Germany they called for use of this test.  And so, we are going to do more and more of that going forward. Roland, do you want to give the numbers of the Cellestis and Ipsogen contributions? Roland Sackers Yeah sure.  As you know, we brought out a press release organic growth in general, but of course Ipsogen was still a small number, and Cellestis was small as it constituted for one month.  And you probably have seen the latest financial statement, that has been the lone company whereas it came in roughly with a $50 million run rate on a yearly basis, and we had more than one month -- slightly more than one month in our books. Operator  Ladies and gentleman, again, could I request that everybody restrict their questions to one question, so that we can get all the participants in today.  Thank you very much for your cooperation. The next question comes from Mr. Lima.  Please say your name, company name followed by your question. Brigitte de Lima - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Good afternoon. It’s Brigitte de Lima from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  And I will stick to the one question.  Just wondering on a HPV as well, I am just wondering how I should think about as the coming quarters for HPV it’s a clearly in the second half, and the fourth quarter you will have this big one-time effect.  So, what happens as we go into Q1 sales that will fall back to the 3Q level, or are there more tenders in the pipeline that will sort of take on from Q4 and we should see similar rates?  I am just trying to understand how that work, are we going to see big hole again next year? Peer Schatz Sure, Bridget.  I think the underlying target is to have a rather stable base on the HPV franchise and build on the growth elements that we have around the QIAsymphony platform and the HPV platform.  There will be some positive contributions to rollout of our automation systems for the various applications that are now completing the workflow and that will be happening over the next few months.  So that could provide a further benefit but in general the overall goal is for us to have -- to see the HPV franchise as stable critical mass base that we are not really expecting growth from but can leverage off new initiatives. Brigitte de Lima - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch I can understand that.  But I guess the question is more are there any other sort of national tenders in the pipeline because otherwise the only thing that worries me for Q3, we saw a bit of a drop in HPV, Q4 is going to be a big increase.  So what happens in Q1 is it going to drop back or as sort of full attendance coming through that will make up so we don’t we see a big shortfall as going to Q1? Peer Schatz Right.  I think this one tender was simply, it was unfortunately moved into the fourth quarter from the third quarter.  So this is why you see now the big growth in Q4 and the low growth in Q3.  And normally we have enough of these, but this was just a very large order that moved.  We are in so many different tenders and programs, there are dozens of these ongoing right now that we are very active and I would hope to have more of them and also to that downside would be that there would be some increase to this type of exposure, but there is so many that I wouldn’t expect this to have this type of volatility that we are seeing in Q3.  It’s rather unusual that we highlighted a deal that would have this type of an impact and I think this is the first time. Operator The next question comes from Mr. Lawson.  Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities Peter Lawson, Mizuho Securities.  Roland and Peer thanks for U.S. HPV breakout.  Since you have done an excellent job in European placements, can we get a breakout of the international HPV contribution at a similar period?  Then how should we think about the run and the pacing for European tenders? Peer Schatz Sure.  If you look at the overall contribution in the U.S. being 15%, and again that’s the portion that that has gone from basically a two competitor franchise to a four competitor franchise over the last 12 months, and that is 15% of our sales.  So, basically 10% market share are worth 1.5% one-time organic sales at QIAGEN.  The International portion is the difference between 15% and 20% that we have.  So we have actually been quite successful in Europe, where we have over 25 competitors including almost all competitors, including all competitors that are in the United States and many more beyond that and also some very substantial one.  So we have actually seen a better growth in this more competitive environment in Europe than we have seen in the United States. Operator The next question is the last question and comes from Mr. Groberg.  Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital Hi, thanks a million for taking the question, its Jon Groberg from Macquarie Capital.  Peer, you obviously talked a lot I think as you kind of rightly highlighted concerns amongst the investor base on HPV.  Would you mind just driving a little bit more detail about the nature of the long-term agreements that you are able to sign, how long they are, whether or not they are completely exclusive to QIAGEN and kind of what you are giving up on price?  That would be great.  Thanks. Peer Schatz Yeah, well, traditionally in this industry contracts are anywhere between two and five years.  That I would say is a standard timeframe that typically is considered one that customers that can enter into quite really, there is a -- there are several clauses that are important when it comes to contract ability to potentially switch technologies if something major mergers or call technology out clause.  We have a lot of these contracts that don’t have those.  So now we have a very, very committed customer base.  And over the next few years, there is a very strong stability in our franchise overall. The -- when you renegotiate these types of contracts there is always a price discussion and we have to remember that that markets have become a lot more competitive and a lot more difficult and challenging that they were 12 or 24 months ago.  And despite that increase in the difference in macro environment, the impacts on pricing has been very moderate.  We haven’t detailed that.  But customers have been very open to long contracts with moderate price concessions, which we have seen also in 2009, 2008 and 2007 as well, every time you renegotiate agreement there is always a certain discussion around pricing as volumes go up and as the market changes or the customers have more price or cost concerns. So, I think we have been very successful in that record and we are very pleased with the performances of our sales teams and bringing over the value of proposition that we will have to customers. Yeah, that’s I think has much callers I think would be helpful now. Solveigh Mähler Yeah. With this I would like to close the conference call by thanking you all for participating today. We hope to come to you again for our fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings conference call on Wednesday, February 1, 2012. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. Again thank you very much and have a nice day. Bye.

One moment for the first question please.  The first question comes from Mr. Lai. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Matt Notarianni - Robert W. Baird Good morning. This is actually Matt in for Quinn Lai at Robert W. Baird.  Starting with kind of the commentary about seeing accelerating growth in to 2012, I was wondering, Peer, if maybe you could help add some color to kind of what you are assuming by end market or maybe kind of the volume dynamics that you might be expecting, just little extra color there? Peer Schatz The majority of these impacts come from the year-over-year effects that we had seen in 2011 especially against the backdrop of the continuing slide in physician utilization rate in the US and also the move to reagent rental models and the roll out of the QIAsymphony systems.  So, this is kind of more from the year-over-year and comparative level.  We saw slower growth in automation as we had seen in the prior year also due to the reagent rentals we also had some the underlying shifts to this end in the physician utilization rates.  So, those things should wash out and over the course of 2012 as they seem to be in a more stable as we have seen in the first half of this year.  So, that is certainly the major effects that would give us some tailwinds into 2012. We continue to expect the challenging markets in the academic and pharmaceutical arenas even though our more company specific related initiatives around our clinical research package and packages in pharmaceutical, molecular development supporting solutions are seeing very dynamic growth, and we've been quite successful in also linking those into diagnostic franchises that we have.  So that, as you know, is our part of our core strategy. So, those are the mix that should continue to boost the top line into 2012.  We remain concerned about the general market environment but we see year-over-year effects and certain company specific effects giving us more tailwinds in 2012. Matt Notarianni - Robert W. Baird Great, thanks for that color.  And then just wanted to kind of dive in on the academic since you really are kind of an outlier with the sort of growth that you have reported here given the uncertainty, anything special in terms of whether you're hearing from the field, customer tone, has it ebbed and flowed kind of throughout the quarter given some of the uncertainty out there? Thanks. Peer Schatz It definitely is a -- the market has seen quite some challenges right now.  And as we know in the United States the budget situation has proven to be a little bit more favorable in 2012 than some people feared but 2013 doesn’t look too good.  However, we should never forget that the US academic budgets, we are talking tens of billions of dollars, the NIH budget alone is $10 billion and now we have half a percent of that.  And so, the ability to grow in this market is not a factor of the overall market growth. It is certainly influenced by that accelerated or impeded by that, but there remain a lot of growth pockets within the overall academic markets. In Europe, it’s very similar, so we see strong funding growth in countries like Germany, and very difficult funding situations in Southern Europe and also the UK.  So, I think there is no real expectation for the funding challenges to go away over the future.  However, we seem to be very well-positioned because contrary to most other suppliers to the academic markets we have been focusing on the clinical application, so being very close to the patient and very close to clinical research and leveraging our ability to transition into diagnostic products.  A system like QIAsymphony, for instance, is also going into some academic and pharmaceutical customer areas simply because it can transition into a more controlled and regulated environment and provide a certain degree of quality. And so that is indicative of the type of positioning we are taking in these markets. And those clinical sub-segments are seeing somewhat better growth in the overall just blue sky basis research area.  And, I think the few ways of validating that is you see a lot of initiatives being published by government to think about creating clinical development activities within academic research and focusing more on partnering to get innovation actually into utility for patients. Operator Ladies and gentleman, please reduce your questions to one so that we can let all participants who would like to ask question take part. The next question comes from Mr. Bonello.  Please state your name, company name follow-up by your question. Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets Thank you. Bill Bonello with RBC Capital Markets. Hey, I am just wondering if you could tell us so that we can get a sense as non-HPV becomes more and more important, what is the organic growth in the quarter was on the non-HPV component of the molecular diagnostics business?  And maybe along with that you could tell us what organic growth would have looked like if you hadn’t had the HPV tender issue? Peer Schatz Yes, that goes into quite some detail, Bill, and although I will try to answer it a few ways.  First the HPV tender was majority of the difference between the growth and non-growth, and so the gap was basically this tender area.  We have seen very good growth in the Profiling and PHC areas.  We said before that Personalized Healthcare is now growing at 40% clip.  And this is not, some people say this is a time we have got three year out business.  This is actually very real.  We are talking quite significant numbers near-term and we were talking about high double-digit million dollars of sales that we are already generating in this area, and this is continuing to grow quite nicely. The Profiling area is one where we are seeing also very strong double-digit growth rates in the assay sales.  However because a lot of these placements are now under reagent rental people are bundling the modules that they buy to synthesize there QIAsymphony RGQ or combine the complete RGQ under reagent rental contracts, and thereby we are not getting the instruments sales, which we partly got in 2010 from other instruments for instance. So the growth in the reagents continue to be a very high double-digit numbers.  I wouldn’t want to go into more specifics on this at this point in time and maybe something that we could split out on an annual basis. Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets That’s very helpful.  But in general even with your comment on the instrument comparison, which is a bit of a just, as you go forward that growth will look different.  I mean in general it sounds like we should think of the non-HPV component of Molecular Diagnostics, as even if it’s growing, at least in the high single-digits or certainly growing at least? Peer Schatz Absolutely, absolutely and this was also visible as over the last few years as HPV was actually not a big growth driver, not a growth driver at all.  We were using this as a critical mass space to develop our overall Molecular Diagnostics franchise, and have been able to diversify the portfolio quite successfully, which is today, actually quite a broad portfolio across many different disease areas and types of testing.  And this has really been our vision over the future.  And so the HPV component went from 20% of our sales base down to 15% and is probably over the future even as we continue efforts to covert markets and drive growth in this area, is probably going to be a lower growth area than PHC and our Personalized Healthcare and Profiling. Operator The next question comes from Mr. Leonard.  Please state your name, company name followed by your question. Dan Leonard - Leerink Swann Thank you, Dan Leonard here from Leerink Swann.  My one question of your parent role and obviously you are looking to drive margin leverage in the business through 2013 and appreciating will get more information at the Analyst Day conceptually how much of this leverage assumption is dependent on assumptions for rapid expansion of sales growth versus how much can you actually achieve if sales growth is more moderate, say in maybe a mid single-digit type of range and what will be the drivers? Peer Schatz Thanks Dan, great question.  Roland, do you want to take that one? Roland Sackers Yeah, sure. Hi, Dan.  If you look at our P&L and just looking at our operational expense number, I think you clearly see that we have a significant possibility to leverage operational expenses here at QIAGEN.  Also looking backwards we clearly did so and the one thing you have to have in mind, we just closed on two large acquisitions.  This clearly also had a short-term impact on our ability to leverage, nevertheless I would believe already in the fourth quarter and for sure in 2012 we will make significant steps forward from the Q3 guidance, which I would call very untypical.  And I believe especially around SG&A we have significant leverage opportunities and the -- our comfort zone is somewhere between around 11% of total revenues, investments. So I feel quite comfortable with achieving our target in that given time period.  We will give on the Analyst Day more time, actually more insight in the different initiatives we started and give also benchmark to you.  As you know we started certain initiatives around logistics, around certain outsourcing activities, and this is clearly helping us going forward into a very significant way. In addition to that, also in general, we still had in a majority of all business over the last couple of years I don’t think that there is difference going forward.  Also around pricing we were able to achieve the significant pricing opportunities that is going to continue and last but not least in terms of utilization wise, in terms of production, we still are wanting right now another typical leverage utilization rate of 65%, we just spent more volume going forward, we should be able to leverage on that as well.  And clearly also makes more molecular less last time transient growth rate, it’s also going to help us proceeding our margin sales and growth here over the next three years. Operator The next question comes from Mr. Peterson.  Please state your name, company name followed by your question. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan It’s Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan.  Maybe starting out with QIAsymphony here in the U.S., I’m just wondering if you can give a little bit more color on some of the uptake patterns, I think, in the past you’ve talked about may be half of the reagent rental, half CapEx sales and obviously it’s split between Molecular Diagnostics and Academia.  So, any color you can provide on some of the dynamics there, and to what degree you’re getting competitive swap outs as well? Peer Schatz Sure.  By far the majority of the placements are in clinical areas and followed by applied testing, which has also seen some success with.  We will have new packages on the QIAsymphony call coming forward for forensic applications next year.  And so, that will probably see stronger growth, also in instrumentation sales it was little weaker this year in some cases in anticipation of that.  By far the majority of the placements are in the clinical area.  And the placements in Europe where we have enough assays to be able to generate the reagent pull through are all most all in reagent rentals, which is actually great news out of the box.  As I said in the recent call, that people put their faith in the system and are willing to commit to multiyear reagent rental contracts.  Primarily, in the area of HIV and Hepatitis, but also in the area of Esoteric testing, and even in some cases Homebrew Reagents.  So, in the United States it’s there is some packaging around ASRs that people are using and also Homebrew Reagents, and clearly as some of the assays are moving to the clinic and toward submission, and in anticipation of that, we expect a much stronger reagent rental opportunity.  But, so it’s almost all of them in Europe and less than the majority in the States. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan And then with regards to HPV, I appreciate the fact you have gone back and locked up a lot of your contracts.  I mean are you hearing from yours customers interesting kind of the bundling dynamic and the idea that HPV will be done with chlamydia gonorrhea and taken other tests.  How do you respond to that?  Obviously, you will have those tests -- some of those tests with [indiscernible] (00:47:39) maybe not trip some many gonorrhea, but how do you deal with that in the near-term? Peer Schatz Yeah, the majority of the add-on tests are actually quite easy to develop and not really differentiate products.  And there are several suppliers or there will be several suppliers offering these additional tests as well.  So, it’s very difficult to differentiate on committee on freak in the future.  I think it all has to do with the – with the solution offering that you are giving to the customer, for a lot of customers in the higher throughput area.  Most of the systems are matched out anyway and the cost of switching is just quite significant especially if they are thinking about moving to a system, which has different workflows or also different analytes that are being used. So, the switching costs are quite significant for any customer over the next few years, until alternatives systems are established.  We are providing a gold standard highly validated solution that has shown clinical superiority in terms of being able to detect diseases significantly above the potential and existing competition.  And so, from that prospective customers feel quite good about running this system, which is running in the high volumes and therefore utilizing the instrument basis that they have on site right now quite well.  If you are very comfortable doing that also there is some foreseeable future. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan Last one on capital deployment.  Any comments here given where the stocks and any change in strategy, and overall what you view as kind of the optimal capital structure well for the business? Peer Schatz Roland, do you want to take that one? Roland Sackers Yes sure.  Also yeah we will give a more detail update on our capital allocation policy on investor event.  You probably are aware also on our recent Analyst General Meeting we asked for approval to do a share buyback.  We got an approval of up to 10% and we will give more details, and certainly our thinking on our investor event. Operator The next question comes from Mr. Quirk.  Please state your name, company name followed by your question. Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray Thanks. Bill Quirk, Piper Jaffray.  Question for Peer given this as the timing of the tender and ebbs and flows of academic research funding we certainly understand that the North America business had a lot of gives and takes this quarter.  If we simply exclude HPV was the business positive in terms of constant exchange rates?  And then secondly, give us any color thinking to what the selective business contributions going forward?  Thank you. Peer Schatz Okay, well, first part of the question I’ll take and the second one Roland if you would take that one.  The trends are as we talked a little bit in the prepared remarks have been actually quite good also in Academia based on some of our initiatives in Pharma, and we have also seen good trends in molecular diagnostics.  And so, the answer is yes we are seeing growth also in the United States, and excluding these onetime effects and the year-over-year effects of the physician office visit decline.

And Cellestis has shown some breakthrough standardization achievements in terms of becoming the standard assay to be used in latent TB testing in several guidelines, in major counties we heard about Germany, as I think a lot of you have heard about.  Also, the new guidelines that have come up in Germany they called for use of this test.  And so, we are going to do more and more of that going forward.
