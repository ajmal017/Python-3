[Operator Instructions] I will turn the call over to Charlie Chen, Vice President of Investor Relations for BlackBerry. Charlie Chen Thank you, Operator. Welcome to BlackBerry’s fiscal 2017 year-end and fourth quarter results conference call. With me on the call today are Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Chen; and Chief Financial Officer, Steve Capelli. After I read our cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements, John will provide a business update and Steve will then review the fourth quarter results. We will then open up the call for a 30-minute Q&A session. In order to let as many people as possible ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. This call is available to the general public via call-in numbers and via webcast in the Investor Relations section at BlackBerry.com. A replay will also be available on the BlackBerry.com website. Some of the statements we will be making today constitute forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of applicable U.S. and Canadian securities laws. We will indicate forward-looking statements by using words such as expect, will, should, model, intend, believe and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors that the Company believes are relevant.

You should not place undue reliance on the Company’s forward-looking statements. The Company has no intention and undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. I will now turn the call over to John. John Chen Thank you, Charlie. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter results conference call. As is customary, I will reference non-GAAP numbers in my summary of our quarterly results. There is a reconciliation table of GAAP to non-GAAP results in the press release. I am pleased to report that our Q4 results came in at or above forecast in all major metrics. Let me run through a high-level summary of that. Revenue came in at $297 million, a noteworthy accomplishment. A stellar growth in software and services exceed the decline in SAF and almost nearly offset the decline in hardware and SAF combined. Total Company software and services revenue came in at $193 million. This represents an increase of 25% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. We achieved our full year target of 30% growth with total software and services of $687 million -- I’m sorry, that’s $687 million. Of course, I’m very pleased with that accomplishment. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 65%. Operating income was $13 million, and EPS was positive $0.04. Note that we achieved the last breakeven of positive -- at least break even or positive EPS each quarter in FY17. For the quarter, we were able to return to positive free cash flow at $16 million, while ending cash -- our ending cash came in at $1.7 billion, up $89 million from last quarter. In our strategic areas of focus, we are executing well and winning important opportunities. As a reminder, our end-to-end secure platform consists of 4 main components. One, the unified endpoint management, we call it UEM; two, horizontal and vertical mobile apps; three, embedded software enabling mobile endpoints such as connected cars; and last but not least, four, the IoT appliances such as BlackBerry Radar. Each of the above areas give us good opportunity for growth and they’re synergistic across all these areas. In addition, our licensing programs are seeing good traction. We have growing pipelines of opportunity in mobile and security software, CPaaS, security software CPaaS, which I am going to cover a little bit later, communication platform as a service and IP licensing. So, now, let me provide you some color on some of the key accomplishments. In enterprise, we saw good win rates and had one of our strongest ever billing quarters, and please don’t ask me what the number is. We processed 3,532 customer orders in Q4, an increase of 16% from last quarter. Notably, we had several large wins with customer in non-regulator industry indicating that our security offering is beginning to resonate in the broader enterprise market. We also saw good performance across the major geographies. Some high profile wins included the Deutsche Post DHL, Nationwide Mutual Insurance, Sutter Health, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Queensland Investment Corporation, Idaho Power, Parliamentary Services in Australia. We are also seeing traction expanding in our partner reach. I have two success stories to share with you. One, in our partnership with China Mobile, we won a 10,000-seat pilot with China Co-Op Group. We’re excited about the significant partner win as well as the potential to expand our business in China. Earlier this month, the Vodafone Germany announced it is the first carrier to offer the full BlackBerry Enterprise Mobility Suite through the SIM-based licensing. Vodafone is offering all tiers and capabilities of our secure suite for managing endpoints, mobile apps, secure messaging, identity management as well as content. You will recall that last quarter we launched our federal Cybersecurity Operations Center focused on achieving FedRAMP certification for the U.S. government. After the quarter, our crisis management platform achieved the FedRAMP and Authority to Operate certificates. We intend to take most of our enterprise products through the certification process. Also on the cyber security front, Giuliani Partner selected BlackBerry Secure as the underlying software platform to support its consulting practice for government enterprise customer. This is the great start in our security services business and you should expect more of these types of partnerships in the future. In embedded software, we’re showcasing our capability to enable the connected cars of the future. Earlier this year at CES, we announced our most advanced and secure embedded offering for autonomous drive and connected cars. The QNS software development platform 7.0, the key feature of that is the 64 bit operating system which enables high performance for more powerful domain controllers inside vehicles. Also included are enhanced kernel-level security protect against the malfunction, malware and cyber attack. The 7.0 release works with ARMv8 and Intel x86, 64 bit architecture. 62 partners have already signed up as beta users on the platform. These partners are in four main groups, in automotive; chip makers; general embedded; and other applications including ISVs. We demonstrated a Level 4 self driving scenario on test track with the Lincoln MKC powered by the BlackBerry software and Renesas hardware, and that’s also at CES, sorry. We also demonstrated at CES a prototype of vehicle management portal. With over 100 million lines of code now, a software code in some of today’s vehicle, there is a growing risk of security breaches and failures. This portal would be targeted for automotive makers and Tier 1 suppliers. It allows user to scan software code, identify vulnerabilities or exposure and view key parameters and attributes in a dashboard view. We received extremely positive feedback from the CES attendees, and we expect to launch this offering later in the fiscal year. In the IoT appliances, we continue to win new business, and we’re building our proof of concept pipeline. I’m pleased to announce Trailer Wizards selected Radar in Q4. Trailer Visits is Canadians’ largest commercial trailer rental and storage companies with 25,000 trailers. Our pipeline is progressing in this area with higher POCs and advancing to older states and new POC entering the funnel, including we added six of them in Q4. Finally, our licensing programs are seeing good traction on multiple fronts. In the quarter, we entered into a long-term software licensing agreement with Optiemus, Optiemus Infracom, to the official name to design, manufacture, sell and support BlackBerry brand mobile devices in the country of India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh. This is the third major device software licensing agreement that we have signed, and we now cover the globe through our agreements, which also included BB Merah Putih, which is the Indonesian outfit and TCL in China. The first two devices were already launched -- were recently launched. The KEYone -- that’s the name, not key one like the most important one. That might be the reason. The KEYone was launched by TCL at Mobile World Congress last month. There were 400 attendees at the launch event, and the device won 10 Mobile World Congress Best of Show awards. Earlier this month, the BlackBerry Aurora was launched in Indonesia with participation from the Indonesian Ministers of Communication and the Canadian Ambassador. There were also 300-plus dealers and 100-plus BlackBerry retail trainers in attendance. We are now expanding to the next phase of our licensing program. This will focus on a broader set of endpoints. What this might mean, and I make no promise, is that you may soon see a BlackBerry tablet, and it will also extend to cobranded handset with IoT and Enterprise of Things to EoT devices. These endpoints will run our software and security features and be cobranded Secure by BlackBerry. We recently released our latest secure handset software from Android. The codename for our product -- the codename for our internal project is by name of Black Widow. [Ph] This release has significant enhancements in enterprise management capabilities, which should support our expanding licensing program. I spoke earlier about the Communication Platform as a Service or CPaaS. The market is a new market opportunity under our licensing efforts also. We launched the BBM Enterprise SDK to address this opportunity. This capability allows partners and developers to integrate secure messaging, voice and video into their application and services. Since the launch, we have seen great receptivity to this release. The offering became available in early February, and 15 ISV has already signed up to start development on with the SDK. We’re seeing solid interest in our offering and specifically in the security features and the internet protocol delivery. We are expecting the first partner apps to be available in Q2. This is again reason significant to us is we will get royalty as the partner start shipping applications. Going forward, we’ll continue to shift resources into all these growth areas I just covered. We’re also investing in partnership and opportunity to expand our global footprint. I will now turn the call over to Steve for a much more detailed look at our financial. Steve? Steve Capelli Thank you, John. Today, we reported Q4 GAAP revenue of $286 million and non-GAAP revenue of $297 million with a GAAP EPS loss of $0.09; non-GAAP EPS was a positive $0.04. Our non-GAAP income statement presentation excludes purchase accounting deferred revenue write-down, debenture fair value adjustment, stock comp expense, restructuring program charges, inventory write-down, amortization of purchased intangibles and business acquisition and integration charges. My comments on our financial performance for the quarter will be in non-GAAP terms unless specified otherwise. For a reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP numbers, please see the earnings press release and supplement published earlier today. I will begin with a consolidated review of our Q4 FY17 income statement results and move on to the individual segments thereafter. Now, let me begin with the consolidated income statement results. Our total revenue for the fourth quarter was $297 million. Our consolidated gross margin was 65% compared to 49% a year ago. Our non-GAAP gross margin excludes restructuring program charges of $6 million, inventory impairment of $4 million and stock comp expense of $1 million. The gross margin improvement of 1,600 basis points over a year ago is attributed to growth of software and services, and more favorable revenue mix. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for consolidated gross margin to approximately 70% for FY18, an 800 basis-point improvement from 62% for all of FY17; operating expenses for $181 million, down from $198 million last quarter. As John mentioned earlier, we are shifting resources with the focus on channels and customer-facing areas, and we will be investing in growth initiatives in FY18. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $47 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses excluding $28 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, $19 million in restructuring charges, $14 million in stock comp expense, $3 million in business acquisition and integration charges, and a benefit of $16 million of fair value adjustment related to the debentures. Non-GAAP operating income was a positive $13 million and non-GAAP income was $23 million. Our adjusted EBITDA was approximately $42 million this quarter, excluding the non-GAAP adjustments previously mentioned. I will now provide a breakdown of our revenue. Total Company software and services was $193 million, representing 65% of total revenue. Roughly 80% of software and services segment revenue excluding IP licensing and professional services was recurring in nature. Device revenue was $55 million, representing 19% of revenue. Total SAF revenue for the fourth quarter was $49 million, representing 16% of revenue. SAF revenue was down 26% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to model a sequential decline in SAF revenue of roughly 25% next quarter. All of our business segments were profitable in Q4 on an operating basis. Now moving to our balance sheet and working capital performance. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments increased to $1.7 billion, up $89 million from $1.6 billion last quarter. Our net cash position was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Aggregate contractual obligations, which includes purchase obligations, operating lease obligations, interest payments, and other goods and services utilized in operations was approximately $398 million at the end of Q4; this is down from $860 million a year ago. There were no purchase orders with contract manufacturers at the end of Q4; this is down from $162 million a year ago and $35 million at the end of Q3. Moving to the cash flow statement. Free cash flow was a positive $16 million in the fourth quarter, which consisted of cash flow from operations of a positive $19 million and capital expenditures of $3 million. Looking forward, we expect positive free cash flow and EBITDA for the full 2018 fiscal year. That concludes my comments. I’ll now turn the call back to John. John Chen Thank you, Steve. Let me now comment on the fiscal year 2018. With our focus and shift towards a software model, we have consolidated our software business to enable tighter product and go-to-market integration. This will make our sales channel more efficient, which allow us to deliver higher value to our customers. With these related changes in our organizational structure, we are addressing the need to revise our segment reporting, beginning next quarter. While we work through the appropriate disclosure requirements, we expect to continue to provide information broken down by software and services, hardware and SAF. We are now taking -- we also are taking into account that many of our shareholders have requested better revenue visibility of our software and services business. Now, on to our outlook for FY18. In our software and services business, we expect to grow at or above the overall market. After completing our planning process and based on our portfolio breakdown, we see market growth of roughly about 10% to 15% on average. We are now targeting the higher end of the range, so somewhere between 13% to 15%. We also expect to be profitable on a non-GAAP basis and free cash flow positive for the full year. With these expectations in mind and looking at the analyst models, I’m generally comfortable with the current consensus for revenue and EPS for Q1 as well as the full year. Now, I will open the call up for Q&A. Operator, will you please administrate that? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steven Li of Raymond James. The line is open, sir. Steven Li Hi, John and Steve. John, a couple of quarters ago, you talk about continuing to harden the BlackBerry software and achieve DoD certifications. Can you give us an update on that? John Chen Yes. Let’s see. We have NIAP certification a quarter ago. So that’s done. I mean, that’s done for the 10.3.3. We released that. So that’s the latest and greatest. We have a further hardening of the products in the Android side, which I just spoke about. We released that also, codename Black Widow, and we continue to spend a lot of time and resources on further doing more certification and more hardening. But the immediate task has been done. Steven Li Great. And you expect both certifications to drive some licensing revenues for you in mobility solutions or do you see them mostly as upside, potential upside? John Chen I think, first of all, the NIAP certification and then also the FedRAMP certification is required to do business in the critical arena with at least for the United States government, and I think it’s acceptable to a lot of governments around the world after we pass in the U.S. standard. So, we have achieved all that. So, it is anchor to our federal business as a whole, both in the UEM side of the equation as well as the ad hoc side of the equation. So, it’s both. The answer to your question is really both. It’s baked into support our current businesses or growing our current businesses as well as winning new projects. We will also license it but where it’s applicable by law. Operator Thank you. Your next questions from Paul Steep of Scotia Capital. Paul Steep Great. John, could you talk a little bit and maybe as well, Steven, with SAF coming down, can you John on the NOC side, talk about how you think about repurposing this infrastructure? Obviously, huge investment, it’s critical. And then Steve, sort of tying into John’s response, how should we think about managing the cost down on that significant infrastructure? John Chen Good question. This is one that we work on continuously. First of all, we’re very proud of our infrastructure in NOCs and many components of NOCs, some of them have to do with security and some of them have to do with relay forwarding. So, where we make sense of the cost structure and how we spend the money, we will repurpose it. We have a number of ideas. I think it’s too premature for me to comment on it, but I would just confirm the fact that we will keep it for our customers because a lot of consumers in their critical infrastructure relied on it; it is a value add that only BlackBerry could bring to the market, but we will also repurpose it as the capacity of the SAF requirements are coming down. So, you asked the right question. I can’t provide you a more detailed answer because it’s still work in progress. Steve Capelli From a cost structure perspective, we have done some stair step measures over the past 12 to 18 months. And the current position that we’re in can still come down but at small levels. With our plans to repurpose, we don’t feel at this point in time there is a need to dramatically change the cost structure for SAF. Obviously, we will review that, should that become necessary. Operator Thank you. And our next question is from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Maynard Um So, if I grow your software business at a 13% to 15% pace, and I think you said your gross margin guidance was 70% for fiscal 2018, does that imply that you’re seeing a decline in your software gross margins in fiscal 2018 or maybe just walk through, where you’re seeing the biggest gross margin impact. Because I think it implies that you’re seeing some decline somewhere. John Chen No, I think it’s a balance of the portfolio. I think Steve said the 70% is where the Company is, and we’re now centering without kind of onetime thing. You remember that a quarter ago, we’re at 70%, but that was a benefit of the warranty side of the equation on devices when we get out of devices. So that’s a onetime thing. The normalized margin is in the mid-50% -- mid-60%. So I think the 65% is really good number for where we are in the portfolio and the percentage of the portfolio. And what Steve is talking about was we’re going to bring it up to 70%. We’re going to work ourselves improving. So, think about it, there are 500 basis point improvement overall in the Company that we’re expecting in FY ‘18. So it’s not a decline of any sort. Steve Capelli And as you look at our software and services businesses as it is today, those margins are 80%, and we expect obviously that same construction of revenue to still have roughly 80% as well. But the combination of all the factors would get us to about 70% for the entire year. Maynard Um Okay. Thanks. And then, can you just talk about the key drivers of that 13% to 15% growth? I think your core MDM and your QNX businesses are your two largest segments. I’m just curious whether you think you can grow those at or closer to those rates? Thank you. John Chen Yes. I think the -- depending on who you look at, I mean, I look at some IDC numbers and Gartner and all that and for the UEM space, and UEM space is broader than just that the EMM space. We look at that number next year that people kind of looking at it at about 10% to 12.5% depending on who you look at. We think we could do better than that. That’s one component of that or Carl thinks he could do better than that. I think it doesn’t matter. Sandeep has a pretty good plan in QNX and particularly going Radar, and that’s -- and I spoke about some of the new ideas like the vehicle portal. Vehicle portals are charged on per month basis per vehicle. So, they’re another recurring revenue; I hope we could build up. So, there is a combination of some current existing products, which we’re very proud of and some of the new stuff that’s coming in online. Not everything will work, as you all know, but I think we’ve got enough iron in the fire that the combination of that makes us feel comfortable we could grow at that numbers. Operator Thanks. Your next question is from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Tim Long Just a clarification and a question. Just trying to get to the software numbers for the quarter. Could you -- it looks like maybe $27 million was reallocated from the traditional reporting. Maybe it moved from Mobility Solutions to software. So, we see the $166 million in there in one of the tables. Can you just clarify what that is? And on the -- maybe answer that, and then I’ll come back with another. John Chen What was that? Steve Capelli He said, answer that; maybe I’ll come back with another. John Chen Oh, I thought we have only one question. Okay, I got it. Yes, that is professional services revenue that apply to helping customers to deploy some of their applications and building some of the applications. So, those are engineers in the mobility group. That’s why the revenue is being reported in the mobility group because the cost is also being reported in mobility group. But these are services and software. Tim Long Okay. So, this is a recurring business; this isn’t just something that happened in the quarter? John Chen We hope so. We hope we will recur it. You know that it ties to task and project and assignments. So, we do hope so. Tim Long Okay. And secondly, on the mobility and the device side, a decent quarter there. Could you just walk us through again the timing of when you think the licensing piece will have a material impact both on revenues and what it means for gross margins for that business? John Chen Yes. It’s a little bit of -- it kind of depends on how you and I define material. But, let me put it in the following way. We just launched two phones or our partners just -- or we helped our partners launch two phones, one in Indonesia, and that one is shipping already. The second one that TCL announced at the Mobile World Congress, which is the physical keyboard on an Android, that one is not going to be slated to ship until probably May timeframe. I think the first production - manufacturing production run is the end of April. So, the product looks pretty good, but the worldwide visibility is going to be later than May. We get it obviously on a quarterly basis on reported ship per unit. So, you could kind of think about that and model that and calculate that. So, from the Indonesia one, we should see -- starting to see some revenue this quarter, and it start ramping up. And that’s our general idea is to pipeline these and then keep growing, the numbers. So, I’d say probably towards the end of the year that you could see some numbers that are significant enough, but you’re going to start seeing some level of ramp up or we should be start seeing some level of ramp. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Gus Papageorgiou of Macquarie. Your line is open. Gus Papageorgiou Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just on Radar, I’m wondering if you can give us a bit of an update there. How many traders or can you give us indication how many traders you currently have on that platform? And what’s your goal for the year? John Chen I don’t have how many traders. You guys have how many traders? In the thousands, right? Steve Capelli Yes. John Chen I’m sorry. I didn’t add up how many traders. My focus had always been the proof of concept and the win, and the reason is everybody will order 500, 1,000, 2,000, those kind of numbers to start even if they have 25,000 trailers, which in this case that we won a trailer with it, they had 25,000 trailers and containers. So, I would say what I focus in on -- in the early orders, the initial orders that usually are much more modest, once they start rolling it out, they literally go then to order just in time. So, to me, it’s really not so much as how many do we have right now but how many are we winning. Gus Papageorgiou When do you think Radar will be material for your revenues, like will it be sometime this year or will it be… John Chen Yes, absolutely. This is a reasonably big piece of our growth plan of the Company that Sandeep is driving, yes. The answer to the question is yes. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is open. Anil Doradla Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, John, just a clarification here. You talk about 13% to 15%; is that based on when you look at the software and services revenue, is that based on the $166 million, which is purely software or some of the reallocations which is going on, the $20 plus million, so that’s like $194 million? So, what are you basing that 15% -- 13% to 15% growth? John Chen I base on the whole thing. So, you guys keep thinking about reallocation. It is not reallocation; it is the people in that group doing software and services. This is why I have to redo the reporting because I think it’s misleading to you all. You all think about mobility solution. When we first put our mobility solution, we used the word mobility solution; we didn’t use the word device, okay? Because I knew this is our plan. Our plan is to get into licensing and get into services because we have a lot of great engineers. And so to remind everybody, these engineers are all QNX-based engineers. The reason is our BB10 was QNX-based. So, it’s not a reallocation, repurpose, whatever it is. It is growing as software business with our device business if that makes sense to people. And so yes, when I talk about 13% to 15%, I talk about as the whole of the software, including that piece. Anil Doradla Very good. And as a follow-up, we saw good drop-off in R&D. Can you explain and give some little bit more color, was it personnel-driven, tools, technology-driven, and how should we be looking at the prioritization in fiscal 2018 on the R&D front? John Chen I didn’t -- could you please repeat that? Steve Capelli Drop in R&D expense, wanted to know really what was behind that? John Chen There are many components. And I think in some areas, we were a little too heavy. Some of the -- we no longer design the hardware, antennas and keyboards and power and supply and all that. We don’t do those anymore. We no longer need engineers in the factories helping the devices -- building devices. So that’s the basic part of it. We also have consolidated some locations, and we also have using some of our overseas locations. So, there’s a combination of things to drive down the cost as a percentage spend on revenue. And so, we’re very focused on getting ourselves into a good model. Steve Capelli I also want to add that if you’re looking at our Mobility Solutions group, you see quite a large decline in that OpEx, and that’s really related to the fact that many of those people providing the services that John just spoke about and that their costs would be resting in COGS associated with the revenue as opposed to just an operating expense. Anil Doradla Great. And if I could squeeze one final thing, John, you’re talking about this new reporting structure to clarify some of this misunderstanding. So, is this just more of a front-end investor kind of presentation or in the backend, are you reorganizing the Company to support this kind of new reporting structure? John Chen We reorganize the company. Operator Our next question’s from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Meta Marshall Hi. This is Meta for James. Just a question on the Ford and QNX announcement yesterday about them hiring some of the QNX employees from BlackBerry, and so just wanted to get a sense of should that change how we think of the OpEx of BlackBerry going forward; and does this just reinforce the relationship, just a little bit about that announcement from yesterday? John Chen Well, first of all, they did not hire QNX engineer. There are some engineers that was hired from our mobility group, but the details I’m not going to comment on, on that particular report. All our numbers that we just provided have factored in everything. So, please don’t take the expense down further because like I have mentioned, and I think Steve mentioned, we actually have a headcount growth plan in mind, but that also is already factored in what we guided, which fits to the Street models on a consensus basis. Operator Our next one is from Paul Treiber of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Paul Treiber Hi. Thanks very much and good morning. Just regards to the professional services in Mobility Solutions, could you elaborate on the type of work that they are doing and then how that may lead to future software revenue or is it solely one-time without the potential for future software revenue? John Chen No. We are not a -- it is good question, thank you because this gave me a chance to clarify. All the work being done are aimed at selling licenses or to create royalty revenue of the future. So, we are not a body shop of any kind. Paul Treiber Okay. Thanks for clarifying. In regards to the agreement with Ford that the press release that you put out last year and in regards to the employees, generally speaking, what’s the opportunity for BlackBerry if an automaker makes a significant investment like Ford’s doing in QNX? And then is it more than just the ASP of the basic OS? John Chen Oh, yes. See, this is where -- first of all, a car is really a computer on the road or mobile computer on the road. And so, each component in it, if you remember, the company at BlackBerry started with a pretty dominant position in infotainment. So, if anyone of you have a 2016 model Ford or a Jaguar or a number of different cars, you are using BlackBerry software. So, the Ford 2016 model has our Sync 3; it’s on BlackBerry, and this is a public statement on both companies. So, I’m not giving you any proprietary information. So, Ford has decided and worked so well with us that they have decided to expand using our software. And then there are areas of telematics; there are areas of safety, ADAS areas, all of that, BlackBerry actually has and have offer in the market. And we continue to build new products and new modules and new ideas of like, for example, on the cyber security side I mentioned the portal management, a vehicle portal management. We hope Ford will take a very, very serious look at it. And with that, we could start having recurring revenue for ourselves and for Ford. We also have over-the-air technology that Ford’s very interested in. So, it’s a much more bigger than just a basic OS. It’s horizontal application; it’s how cars put together and how cars modules talk to each other. Future car is basically one huge program. So, I am very bullish, and this is only with Ford, and it is nonexclusive. So, if I could do more with others, other car manufacturers around the world, Europe, Asia that will be even better. Paul Treiber Just one follow-up to that. In regards to other automakers, I mean, what do you think the likelihood of winning agreements of a similar magnitude of Ford? John Chen Likely. Paul Treiber Okay. Thank you. John Chen We just need a little bit of time. We are pretty -- as we are recognized leader in this whole world and both in the QNX embedded software as well as in cyber, cyber security. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Todd Coupland of CIBC. Your line is now open. Todd Coupland Just a clarification on OpEx, and then I had a QNX question. So, are you saying on OpEx that the $190 million, plus or minus, is the baseline and that’ll grow some but revenue and margins will grow faster, which gets you to the operating leverage in 2018; is that the takeaway? John Chen Yes. That’s pretty much our model, yes. Todd Coupland Okay. So, my question on QNX and just the automotive opportunity. So, with respect to that last question, John, I get like all those pieces you’re working on. The one thing we’re struggling with is if you sort of stack all that up without giving us individual pricing on each one of those areas, when you think about sort of a per car opportunity for your business, how are you thinking about that? Is that over time, $10 per car, $50 per car? How are you thinking about it? John Chen Yes, I think about it. So, I’ll give you the current -- I’m not giving you the pricing of that. But if you look at our current infotainment systems, I think the street price is about $3 to $5 a car. That’s the Street price. So my competitors and myself and everybody is in that neighborhood. And if you stack these modules together, the ARPU should be 4, 5 times of that number. Now of course, now you have to do discount it, and you’ve got the volume wise it and then the new product that’s got coming out. So, I mean it’s just a normal type of business where you continue to enhance the offering, and each of the offering is a module, and you get royalty on that and then -- and one of the thing that I think is exciting for us is not that we’re done there, by the way. I just want to make sure that everybody understands. When I talk about a portal, a vehicle portal management, it’s kind of the next things that we’re focusing on is to generally recurring monthly revenue and all from these kind of the world of connected cars and the need to have enhanced security or constant monitoring of security and antihacking and malware. So, all the stuff that I talk about, all have a common theme in how we grow our business and our revenue. So rather than getting a set amount of dollars per car when we roll it out the manufacturing line, we want that too. We want that, and we want a higher ARPU of that, and we want a service component of that on a monthly basis. Todd Coupland And when you think about this business over the next, let’s say, three years, auto market globally is 100 million units. What’s a realistic market share for QNX? John Chen That’s a great question. I would tell you this. Infotainment, we own over half the market today, 60 million cars. So, I hope that give us some leverage and continue R&D, and this is why we created the autonomous driving car centers, innovation centers in Ottawa a quarter-plus ago because we wanted to attract partners with us to build application on our platform. People often asked me what I’m going to build an autonomous car. No, I’m not. I’m not building an autonomous car. I don’t want to compete with my customer, nor do I want to compete with very, very big name that wanted to spend hundreds of millions, if not billions in there. I’m not building any autonomous car. I am building the components that enable other people to build their autonomous car. And we created a platform in Ottawa. We welcome anybody who come in, and we have a lot of partners that come in and test out on our platform, and so they could work on their autonomous part of the car. Today, the connected car is a huge market as you all know. The autonomous car is probably going to be post-2020 so forth and so forth. I mean I’m getting too much into it, but we also we are very excited about this market. Operator Thank you. Your next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kulbinder Garcha Thank you. Just one clarification and one question. On the clarification, in the quarter, were there any major IP or patent sales onetime in nature or otherwise? John Chen No, our IP numbers are very small in the quarter. Kulbinder Garcha And then, basically for the full year then in 2018, what you guys sound like you say that software and services growth in that double-digit range of 13% to 15% maybe gross margin at 70%, and you should have OpEx from this run rate exiting the year going to be down or is it going to grow. Actually I missed that point. Can you clarify that part? John Chen Yes. As I said, I mean, I don’t want to make a single statement on one area because I think when we review the consensus model that you all have for Q1 and for the year, it looks quite reasonable. Interesting enough, when we roll out our numbers, it’s very close to your numbers. So that’s good. That’s goodness. So, we are going to grow our expenses because we have many areas that we would like to invest in. However, we are also going to reduce some of the areas. So, I think, by and large, the growth in expenses will be relatively modest throughout the year because we’re going to be taking some of the cost structure out, and we’re going to try to find ways to do things in much more efficient way and effective way and then invest the dollars. And we, in fact, you folks may not know this, but I’ll give you one stack. We actually have hired 1,000 people last year, and I know everybody’s going to ask me about that, right? But we have a pretty big feel now reach to the market, and we cover almost all the financial institutions in the G7 world, so to speak, and the governments. So, we have a pretty good execution in the field now. We have a very big customer support team that is more customer-facing than in the professional services. But in the meantime, we have shifted away -- our G&A came down quite a bit and headcount. So, it’s just that way of also rationalizing where we put our money and where the number is. So, if you go back to model, that is now consensus, it’s actually reasonable in the ballpark. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Kim of Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Michael Kim Hi. Good morning, guys. With regards to the device business and the partnerships that you’ve established, how should we think about per-unit royalties trending as volume scales? And then just in terms of total volume, do you see it returning closer to historical levels around, say 2 million units annually or closer to 1 million? John Chen I could answer the second. I cannot answer the first because the first question, first of all, it’s different with all three, and we have a different pricing, tiering model for the mix set, but I’m glad you mentioned something here. I want to clarify one point that I sneak into my script that now everybody’s going crazy around me. You don’t know. By the way, this is one of those like what is that, you kind of like the TV studio. While I’m talking to you, there’s a bunch of activities around me started to distract me And apparently one statement I make regarding tablet was people got very excited and wanted to know whether this is a PlayBook again or something, absolutely not. I’m not building any hardware. Other than Radar, sorry, other than Radar, I’m not building piece of hardware. One of our partners get very excited to build a tablet, which based on Android, and so -- and they wanted us to give them the portfolio rights to do that, and I’m interested in that because I’m going to get royalty for every piece of tablet they ship. So, I will just leave it at that, and it’s not even -- we have to QA it. We have to do a lot of things with it. So it’s not 100% committed thing, but it’s going to come from our partners, and BlackBerry will only receive royalty, but it’s using our software, and we do the QA and portfolio management. So, I hope that clarifies that point. So, in terms of unit count, I got three groups of people taking it worldwide. In the India market and definitely in the China market, in the Indonesian market, if you get all that and products across the world, I will be -- personally, I’d be disappointed if it’s 1 million units. I would think that -- I will help them to do more marketing on that. So, I really do believe that this is a multimillion unit a year situation. Michael Kim Great. That’s very helpful. And then just on Radar, I know you continue to ramp your go-to-market with six customer pilots, I think you mentioned for this fourth quarter and six in the previous quarter. Can you talk about how long the POCs are running and then your sense on conversions? John Chen Yes, usually, it’s three to six months, the POC and then about three months of the kind of contract negotiations and getting the orders and shipping. So, this is a six months to a nine months win or conversion into revenue. Michael Kim Got it. Thanks very much.  John Chen Thank you. Okay, I think we only have five minutes. So, okay, we could take one more, please. Operator Yes, sir. Our last question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Simona Jankowski Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted to clarify one more time in terms of the as reported software and services segment, which includes the UEM and QNX revenues. Can you just comment on, since that was relatively flat sequentially, how both of those components trended on a sequential basis, QNX and UEM, were they up or down? John Chen Sequentially flat, they’re not sequentially flat at all. I know UEM had gained quite a bit. So… Steve Capelli The overall number -- I’m trying to go back to it. Simona Jankowski I was just talking about the as reported segment numbers, so not including that professional services piece out of the Mobility Solutions business. Steve Capelli In terms of relatively flat, I mean, your point’s well taken. I would attribute part of that to John made a reference to our billings were larger. And… John Chen On the deferred? I mean, not the deferred, subscription? Steve Capelli On the subscription revenue. So, we had an increase in the subscription that had that not taken place, you’d have seen a different set of numbers. John Chen Simona, I’m more focused on billings. Just like on the Radar, I’m more focused on the POC win because I know that’s future revenue. And so sorry that I didn’t know what you exactly meant. It was on the revenue number that you focused on. Simona Jankowski Yes, I just wanted to clarify that. And then the 13% to 15%, you commented that the base that you’re going to grow that off of includes that professional services piece that you just had in Mobility Solutions. Just so we know the full base for the full year, were there any other meaningful similar amounts in the full fiscal 2017 base that we should be aware of just as we think about that growth rate? John Chen No. As I said, the 13% to 15% is our overall number that 687 million or so, no, there is no other significant amount that you should think about. Steve Capelli On the services side, we said that that would be included, and you may recall there was a smaller number than that in Q3. But as John pointed out, we’re looking at that total software and services number. John Chen Simona, I never learned. I gave you guys 30% last time, I did it, and now I gave you another number. It’s really -- I think at this time, I’m going to poke myself in the eye. I’m going to stop giving any numbers in the future. Simona Jankowski Well, I think it’ll get clear with the new segments, but thank you very much. John Chen Okay. All right, then. Thank you for all of us to joining us. I’m sorry we’re out of time because I have to got to do our own town hall meeting. So, I appreciate you dialing in, and have a great day.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steven Li of Raymond James. The line is open, sir. Steven Li Hi, John and Steve. John, a couple of quarters ago, you talk about continuing to harden the BlackBerry software and achieve DoD certifications. Can you give us an update on that? John Chen Yes. Let’s see. We have NIAP certification a quarter ago. So that’s done. I mean, that’s done for the 10.3.3. We released that. So that’s the latest and greatest. We have a further hardening of the products in the Android side, which I just spoke about. We released that also, codename Black Widow, and we continue to spend a lot of time and resources on further doing more certification and more hardening. But the immediate task has been done. Steven Li Great. And you expect both certifications to drive some licensing revenues for you in mobility solutions or do you see them mostly as upside, potential upside? John Chen I think, first of all, the NIAP certification and then also the FedRAMP certification is required to do business in the critical arena with at least for the United States government, and I think it’s acceptable to a lot of governments around the world after we pass in the U.S. standard. So, we have achieved all that. So, it is anchor to our federal business as a whole, both in the UEM side of the equation as well as the ad hoc side of the equation. So, it’s both. The answer to your question is really both. It’s baked into support our current businesses or growing our current businesses as well as winning new projects. We will also license it but where it’s applicable by law. Operator Thank you. Your next questions from Paul Steep of Scotia Capital. Paul Steep Great. John, could you talk a little bit and maybe as well, Steven, with SAF coming down, can you John on the NOC side, talk about how you think about repurposing this infrastructure? Obviously, huge investment, it’s critical. And then Steve, sort of tying into John’s response, how should we think about managing the cost down on that significant infrastructure? John Chen Good question. This is one that we work on continuously. First of all, we’re very proud of our infrastructure in NOCs and many components of NOCs, some of them have to do with security and some of them have to do with relay forwarding. So, where we make sense of the cost structure and how we spend the money, we will repurpose it. We have a number of ideas. I think it’s too premature for me to comment on it, but I would just confirm the fact that we will keep it for our customers because a lot of consumers in their critical infrastructure relied on it; it is a value add that only BlackBerry could bring to the market, but we will also repurpose it as the capacity of the SAF requirements are coming down. So, you asked the right question. I can’t provide you a more detailed answer because it’s still work in progress. Steve Capelli From a cost structure perspective, we have done some stair step measures over the past 12 to 18 months. And the current position that we’re in can still come down but at small levels. With our plans to repurpose, we don’t feel at this point in time there is a need to dramatically change the cost structure for SAF. Obviously, we will review that, should that become necessary. Operator Thank you. And our next question is from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Maynard Um So, if I grow your software business at a 13% to 15% pace, and I think you said your gross margin guidance was 70% for fiscal 2018, does that imply that you’re seeing a decline in your software gross margins in fiscal 2018 or maybe just walk through, where you’re seeing the biggest gross margin impact. Because I think it implies that you’re seeing some decline somewhere. John Chen No, I think it’s a balance of the portfolio. I think Steve said the 70% is where the Company is, and we’re now centering without kind of onetime thing. You remember that a quarter ago, we’re at 70%, but that was a benefit of the warranty side of the equation on devices when we get out of devices. So that’s a onetime thing. The normalized margin is in the mid-50% -- mid-60%. So I think the 65% is really good number for where we are in the portfolio and the percentage of the portfolio. And what Steve is talking about was we’re going to bring it up to 70%. We’re going to work ourselves improving. So, think about it, there are 500 basis point improvement overall in the Company that we’re expecting in FY ‘18. So it’s not a decline of any sort. Steve Capelli And as you look at our software and services businesses as it is today, those margins are 80%, and we expect obviously that same construction of revenue to still have roughly 80% as well. But the combination of all the factors would get us to about 70% for the entire year. Maynard Um Okay. Thanks. And then, can you just talk about the key drivers of that 13% to 15% growth? I think your core MDM and your QNX businesses are your two largest segments. I’m just curious whether you think you can grow those at or closer to those rates? Thank you. John Chen Yes. I think the -- depending on who you look at, I mean, I look at some IDC numbers and Gartner and all that and for the UEM space, and UEM space is broader than just that the EMM space. We look at that number next year that people kind of looking at it at about 10% to 12.5% depending on who you look at. We think we could do better than that. That’s one component of that or Carl thinks he could do better than that. I think it doesn’t matter. Sandeep has a pretty good plan in QNX and particularly going Radar, and that’s -- and I spoke about some of the new ideas like the vehicle portal. Vehicle portals are charged on per month basis per vehicle. So, they’re another recurring revenue; I hope we could build up. So, there is a combination of some current existing products, which we’re very proud of and some of the new stuff that’s coming in online. Not everything will work, as you all know, but I think we’ve got enough iron in the fire that the combination of that makes us feel comfortable we could grow at that numbers. Operator Thanks. Your next question is from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Tim Long Just a clarification and a question. Just trying to get to the software numbers for the quarter. Could you -- it looks like maybe $27 million was reallocated from the traditional reporting. Maybe it moved from Mobility Solutions to software. So, we see the $166 million in there in one of the tables. Can you just clarify what that is? And on the -- maybe answer that, and then I’ll come back with another. John Chen What was that? Steve Capelli He said, answer that; maybe I’ll come back with another. John Chen Oh, I thought we have only one question. Okay, I got it. Yes, that is professional services revenue that apply to helping customers to deploy some of their applications and building some of the applications. So, those are engineers in the mobility group. That’s why the revenue is being reported in the mobility group because the cost is also being reported in mobility group. But these are services and software. Tim Long Okay. So, this is a recurring business; this isn’t just something that happened in the quarter? John Chen We hope so. We hope we will recur it. You know that it ties to task and project and assignments. So, we do hope so. Tim Long Okay. And secondly, on the mobility and the device side, a decent quarter there. Could you just walk us through again the timing of when you think the licensing piece will have a material impact both on revenues and what it means for gross margins for that business? John Chen Yes. It’s a little bit of -- it kind of depends on how you and I define material. But, let me put it in the following way. We just launched two phones or our partners just -- or we helped our partners launch two phones, one in Indonesia, and that one is shipping already. The second one that TCL announced at the Mobile World Congress, which is the physical keyboard on an Android, that one is not going to be slated to ship until probably May timeframe. I think the first production - manufacturing production run is the end of April. So, the product looks pretty good, but the worldwide visibility is going to be later than May. We get it obviously on a quarterly basis on reported ship per unit. So, you could kind of think about that and model that and calculate that. So, from the Indonesia one, we should see -- starting to see some revenue this quarter, and it start ramping up. And that’s our general idea is to pipeline these and then keep growing, the numbers. So, I’d say probably towards the end of the year that you could see some numbers that are significant enough, but you’re going to start seeing some level of ramp up or we should be start seeing some level of ramp. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Gus Papageorgiou of Macquarie. Your line is open. Gus Papageorgiou Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just on Radar, I’m wondering if you can give us a bit of an update there. How many traders or can you give us indication how many traders you currently have on that platform? And what’s your goal for the year? John Chen I don’t have how many traders. You guys have how many traders? In the thousands, right? Steve Capelli Yes. John Chen I’m sorry. I didn’t add up how many traders. My focus had always been the proof of concept and the win, and the reason is everybody will order 500, 1,000, 2,000, those kind of numbers to start even if they have 25,000 trailers, which in this case that we won a trailer with it, they had 25,000 trailers and containers. So, I would say what I focus in on -- in the early orders, the initial orders that usually are much more modest, once they start rolling it out, they literally go then to order just in time. So, to me, it’s really not so much as how many do we have right now but how many are we winning. Gus Papageorgiou When do you think Radar will be material for your revenues, like will it be sometime this year or will it be… John Chen Yes, absolutely. This is a reasonably big piece of our growth plan of the Company that Sandeep is driving, yes. The answer to the question is yes. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is open. Anil Doradla Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, John, just a clarification here. You talk about 13% to 15%; is that based on when you look at the software and services revenue, is that based on the $166 million, which is purely software or some of the reallocations which is going on, the $20 plus million, so that’s like $194 million? So, what are you basing that 15% -- 13% to 15% growth? John Chen I base on the whole thing. So, you guys keep thinking about reallocation. It is not reallocation; it is the people in that group doing software and services. This is why I have to redo the reporting because I think it’s misleading to you all. You all think about mobility solution. When we first put our mobility solution, we used the word mobility solution; we didn’t use the word device, okay? Because I knew this is our plan. Our plan is to get into licensing and get into services because we have a lot of great engineers. And so to remind everybody, these engineers are all QNX-based engineers. The reason is our BB10 was QNX-based. So, it’s not a reallocation, repurpose, whatever it is. It is growing as software business with our device business if that makes sense to people. And so yes, when I talk about 13% to 15%, I talk about as the whole of the software, including that piece. Anil Doradla Very good. And as a follow-up, we saw good drop-off in R&D. Can you explain and give some little bit more color, was it personnel-driven, tools, technology-driven, and how should we be looking at the prioritization in fiscal 2018 on the R&D front? John Chen I didn’t -- could you please repeat that? Steve Capelli Drop in R&D expense, wanted to know really what was behind that? John Chen There are many components. And I think in some areas, we were a little too heavy. Some of the -- we no longer design the hardware, antennas and keyboards and power and supply and all that. We don’t do those anymore. We no longer need engineers in the factories helping the devices -- building devices. So that’s the basic part of it. We also have consolidated some locations, and we also have using some of our overseas locations. So, there’s a combination of things to drive down the cost as a percentage spend on revenue. And so, we’re very focused on getting ourselves into a good model. Steve Capelli I also want to add that if you’re looking at our Mobility Solutions group, you see quite a large decline in that OpEx, and that’s really related to the fact that many of those people providing the services that John just spoke about and that their costs would be resting in COGS associated with the revenue as opposed to just an operating expense. Anil Doradla Great. And if I could squeeze one final thing, John, you’re talking about this new reporting structure to clarify some of this misunderstanding. So, is this just more of a front-end investor kind of presentation or in the backend, are you reorganizing the Company to support this kind of new reporting structure? John Chen We reorganize the company. Operator Our next question’s from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Meta Marshall Hi. This is Meta for James. Just a question on the Ford and QNX announcement yesterday about them hiring some of the QNX employees from BlackBerry, and so just wanted to get a sense of should that change how we think of the OpEx of BlackBerry going forward; and does this just reinforce the relationship, just a little bit about that announcement from yesterday? John Chen Well, first of all, they did not hire QNX engineer. There are some engineers that was hired from our mobility group, but the details I’m not going to comment on, on that particular report. All our numbers that we just provided have factored in everything. So, please don’t take the expense down further because like I have mentioned, and I think Steve mentioned, we actually have a headcount growth plan in mind, but that also is already factored in what we guided, which fits to the Street models on a consensus basis. Operator Our next one is from Paul Treiber of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Paul Treiber Hi. Thanks very much and good morning. Just regards to the professional services in Mobility Solutions, could you elaborate on the type of work that they are doing and then how that may lead to future software revenue or is it solely one-time without the potential for future software revenue? John Chen No. We are not a -- it is good question, thank you because this gave me a chance to clarify. All the work being done are aimed at selling licenses or to create royalty revenue of the future. So, we are not a body shop of any kind. Paul Treiber Okay. Thanks for clarifying. In regards to the agreement with Ford that the press release that you put out last year and in regards to the employees, generally speaking, what’s the opportunity for BlackBerry if an automaker makes a significant investment like Ford’s doing in QNX? And then is it more than just the ASP of the basic OS? John Chen Oh, yes. See, this is where -- first of all, a car is really a computer on the road or mobile computer on the road. And so, each component in it, if you remember, the company at BlackBerry started with a pretty dominant position in infotainment. So, if anyone of you have a 2016 model Ford or a Jaguar or a number of different cars, you are using BlackBerry software. So, the Ford 2016 model has our Sync 3; it’s on BlackBerry, and this is a public statement on both companies. So, I’m not giving you any proprietary information. So, Ford has decided and worked so well with us that they have decided to expand using our software. And then there are areas of telematics; there are areas of safety, ADAS areas, all of that, BlackBerry actually has and have offer in the market. And we continue to build new products and new modules and new ideas of like, for example, on the cyber security side I mentioned the portal management, a vehicle portal management. We hope Ford will take a very, very serious look at it. And with that, we could start having recurring revenue for ourselves and for Ford. We also have over-the-air technology that Ford’s very interested in. So, it’s a much more bigger than just a basic OS. It’s horizontal application; it’s how cars put together and how cars modules talk to each other. Future car is basically one huge program. So, I am very bullish, and this is only with Ford, and it is nonexclusive. So, if I could do more with others, other car manufacturers around the world, Europe, Asia that will be even better. Paul Treiber Just one follow-up to that. In regards to other automakers, I mean, what do you think the likelihood of winning agreements of a similar magnitude of Ford? John Chen Likely. Paul Treiber Okay. Thank you. John Chen We just need a little bit of time. We are pretty -- as we are recognized leader in this whole world and both in the QNX embedded software as well as in cyber, cyber security. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Todd Coupland of CIBC. Your line is now open. Todd Coupland Just a clarification on OpEx, and then I had a QNX question. So, are you saying on OpEx that the $190 million, plus or minus, is the baseline and that’ll grow some but revenue and margins will grow faster, which gets you to the operating leverage in 2018; is that the takeaway? John Chen Yes. That’s pretty much our model, yes. Todd Coupland Okay. So, my question on QNX and just the automotive opportunity. So, with respect to that last question, John, I get like all those pieces you’re working on. The one thing we’re struggling with is if you sort of stack all that up without giving us individual pricing on each one of those areas, when you think about sort of a per car opportunity for your business, how are you thinking about that? Is that over time, $10 per car, $50 per car? How are you thinking about it? John Chen Yes, I think about it. So, I’ll give you the current -- I’m not giving you the pricing of that. But if you look at our current infotainment systems, I think the street price is about $3 to $5 a car. That’s the Street price. So my competitors and myself and everybody is in that neighborhood. And if you stack these modules together, the ARPU should be 4, 5 times of that number. Now of course, now you have to do discount it, and you’ve got the volume wise it and then the new product that’s got coming out. So, I mean it’s just a normal type of business where you continue to enhance the offering, and each of the offering is a module, and you get royalty on that and then -- and one of the thing that I think is exciting for us is not that we’re done there, by the way. I just want to make sure that everybody understands. When I talk about a portal, a vehicle portal management, it’s kind of the next things that we’re focusing on is to generally recurring monthly revenue and all from these kind of the world of connected cars and the need to have enhanced security or constant monitoring of security and antihacking and malware. So, all the stuff that I talk about, all have a common theme in how we grow our business and our revenue. So rather than getting a set amount of dollars per car when we roll it out the manufacturing line, we want that too. We want that, and we want a higher ARPU of that, and we want a service component of that on a monthly basis. Todd Coupland And when you think about this business over the next, let’s say, three years, auto market globally is 100 million units. What’s a realistic market share for QNX? John Chen That’s a great question. I would tell you this. Infotainment, we own over half the market today, 60 million cars. So, I hope that give us some leverage and continue R&D, and this is why we created the autonomous driving car centers, innovation centers in Ottawa a quarter-plus ago because we wanted to attract partners with us to build application on our platform. People often asked me what I’m going to build an autonomous car. No, I’m not. I’m not building an autonomous car. I don’t want to compete with my customer, nor do I want to compete with very, very big name that wanted to spend hundreds of millions, if not billions in there. I’m not building any autonomous car. I am building the components that enable other people to build their autonomous car. And we created a platform in Ottawa. We welcome anybody who come in, and we have a lot of partners that come in and test out on our platform, and so they could work on their autonomous part of the car. Today, the connected car is a huge market as you all know. The autonomous car is probably going to be post-2020 so forth and so forth. I mean I’m getting too much into it, but we also we are very excited about this market. Operator Thank you. Your next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kulbinder Garcha Thank you. Just one clarification and one question. On the clarification, in the quarter, were there any major IP or patent sales onetime in nature or otherwise? John Chen No, our IP numbers are very small in the quarter. Kulbinder Garcha And then, basically for the full year then in 2018, what you guys sound like you say that software and services growth in that double-digit range of 13% to 15% maybe gross margin at 70%, and you should have OpEx from this run rate exiting the year going to be down or is it going to grow. Actually I missed that point. Can you clarify that part? John Chen Yes. As I said, I mean, I don’t want to make a single statement on one area because I think when we review the consensus model that you all have for Q1 and for the year, it looks quite reasonable. Interesting enough, when we roll out our numbers, it’s very close to your numbers. So that’s good. That’s goodness. So, we are going to grow our expenses because we have many areas that we would like to invest in. However, we are also going to reduce some of the areas. So, I think, by and large, the growth in expenses will be relatively modest throughout the year because we’re going to be taking some of the cost structure out, and we’re going to try to find ways to do things in much more efficient way and effective way and then invest the dollars. And we, in fact, you folks may not know this, but I’ll give you one stack. We actually have hired 1,000 people last year, and I know everybody’s going to ask me about that, right? But we have a pretty big feel now reach to the market, and we cover almost all the financial institutions in the G7 world, so to speak, and the governments. So, we have a pretty good execution in the field now. We have a very big customer support team that is more customer-facing than in the professional services. But in the meantime, we have shifted away -- our G&A came down quite a bit and headcount. So, it’s just that way of also rationalizing where we put our money and where the number is. So, if you go back to model, that is now consensus, it’s actually reasonable in the ballpark. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Kim of Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Michael Kim Hi. Good morning, guys. With regards to the device business and the partnerships that you’ve established, how should we think about per-unit royalties trending as volume scales? And then just in terms of total volume, do you see it returning closer to historical levels around, say 2 million units annually or closer to 1 million? John Chen I could answer the second. I cannot answer the first because the first question, first of all, it’s different with all three, and we have a different pricing, tiering model for the mix set, but I’m glad you mentioned something here. I want to clarify one point that I sneak into my script that now everybody’s going crazy around me. You don’t know. By the way, this is one of those like what is that, you kind of like the TV studio. While I’m talking to you, there’s a bunch of activities around me started to distract me And apparently one statement I make regarding tablet was people got very excited and wanted to know whether this is a PlayBook again or something, absolutely not. I’m not building any hardware. Other than Radar, sorry, other than Radar, I’m not building piece of hardware. One of our partners get very excited to build a tablet, which based on Android, and so -- and they wanted us to give them the portfolio rights to do that, and I’m interested in that because I’m going to get royalty for every piece of tablet they ship. So, I will just leave it at that, and it’s not even -- we have to QA it. We have to do a lot of things with it. So it’s not 100% committed thing, but it’s going to come from our partners, and BlackBerry will only receive royalty, but it’s using our software, and we do the QA and portfolio management. So, I hope that clarifies that point. So, in terms of unit count, I got three groups of people taking it worldwide. In the India market and definitely in the China market, in the Indonesian market, if you get all that and products across the world, I will be -- personally, I’d be disappointed if it’s 1 million units. I would think that -- I will help them to do more marketing on that. So, I really do believe that this is a multimillion unit a year situation. Michael Kim Great. That’s very helpful. And then just on Radar, I know you continue to ramp your go-to-market with six customer pilots, I think you mentioned for this fourth quarter and six in the previous quarter. Can you talk about how long the POCs are running and then your sense on conversions? John Chen Yes, usually, it’s three to six months, the POC and then about three months of the kind of contract negotiations and getting the orders and shipping. So, this is a six months to a nine months win or conversion into revenue. Michael Kim Got it. Thanks very much.  John Chen Thank you. Okay, I think we only have five minutes. So, okay, we could take one more, please. Operator Yes, sir. Our last question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Simona Jankowski Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted to clarify one more time in terms of the as reported software and services segment, which includes the UEM and QNX revenues. Can you just comment on, since that was relatively flat sequentially, how both of those components trended on a sequential basis, QNX and UEM, were they up or down? John Chen Sequentially flat, they’re not sequentially flat at all. I know UEM had gained quite a bit. So… Steve Capelli The overall number -- I’m trying to go back to it. Simona Jankowski I was just talking about the as reported segment numbers, so not including that professional services piece out of the Mobility Solutions business. Steve Capelli In terms of relatively flat, I mean, your point’s well taken. I would attribute part of that to John made a reference to our billings were larger. And… John Chen On the deferred? I mean, not the deferred, subscription? Steve Capelli On the subscription revenue. So, we had an increase in the subscription that had that not taken place, you’d have seen a different set of numbers. John Chen Simona, I’m more focused on billings. Just like on the Radar, I’m more focused on the POC win because I know that’s future revenue. And so sorry that I didn’t know what you exactly meant. It was on the revenue number that you focused on. Simona Jankowski Yes, I just wanted to clarify that. And then the 13% to 15%, you commented that the base that you’re going to grow that off of includes that professional services piece that you just had in Mobility Solutions. Just so we know the full base for the full year, were there any other meaningful similar amounts in the full fiscal 2017 base that we should be aware of just as we think about that growth rate? John Chen No. As I said, the 13% to 15% is our overall number that 687 million or so, no, there is no other significant amount that you should think about. Steve Capelli On the services side, we said that that would be included, and you may recall there was a smaller number than that in Q3. But as John pointed out, we’re looking at that total software and services number. John Chen Simona, I never learned. I gave you guys 30% last time, I did it, and now I gave you another number. It’s really -- I think at this time, I’m going to poke myself in the eye. I’m going to stop giving any numbers in the future. Simona Jankowski Well, I think it’ll get clear with the new segments, but thank you very much. John Chen Okay. All right, then. Thank you for all of us to joining us. I’m sorry we’re out of time because I have to got to do our own town hall meeting. So, I appreciate you dialing in, and have a great day.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BEA Systems fourth quarter and year-end 2008 conference call. During this call all participants will be in a listen-only mode and today's conference call is being recorded. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Faulkner, BEA's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir Kevin Faulkner Thank you, Michael. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us as we discussed BEA Systems, Inc. results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2008. Please note we've posted our earnings press release and the related financial tables on our website at bea.com.

Now, I'd like to introduce from BEA Alfred Chuang, who is Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Dentinger, Chief Financial Officer. Alfred and Mark will make some prepared remarks, but we will not have a question-and-answer session on today's call. With that, I'm pleased to introduce and turn the call over to Alfred Chuang. Go ahead, Alfred. Alfred Chuang Thanks, Kevin. Thank you for joining us today. As you're all aware, during Q4, BEA announced that we enter into an agreement to merger Oracle. Over the last six weeks, I had an opportunity to talk to many customers, partners, and employees, and received positive feedback on the combination. Customers are excited as I am about the opportunity for combined BEA and Oracle to accelerate innovation in application and service infrastructure. BEA has built an amazing set of products, and our customers have used those products to power some of the most innovative business solutions. By combining with Oracle, we can have access to a larger global footprint of sales and services professionals, to help even more customers meet their business needs. The proposed combination creates a very exciting opportunity for our customers, partners, and also employees. The agreement was announced during the great quarter. In Q4, we delivered our best license performance ever. We had a very strong December close, and that was followed by a very solid January as well. Our Q4 results demonstrate that customers continue to adopt BEA technology as a foundation of their SOA architectures, and they continue to share our vision about the next-generation of enterprise computing. Congratulations to the team for maintaining the focus on customer success and execution. We had very solid Q4 and FY'08 results. In the fourth quarter, we returned to year-over-year license revenue growth. Total license revenue was up 13% over last year’s Q4. AquaLogic sustained its contribution level at a record 27% of license revenue. Services revenue continued a strong growth, up 17% over a year ago. We have record operating cash flow. Q4 included a solid year. Total revenue grew 10%. Maintenance revenue grew 18%. We generated $367 million in operating cash flow, by far our best year. We added $28 million to our deferred revenues and $25 million to our off balance sheet license backlog. We improved a non-GAAP operating margin by 200 basis points, outperforming our goal of the year. Let me turn over to Mark now, first to give you details on Q4 and fiscal 2008 results. Then I'll return to talk more about our business. We will not be providing Q&A guidance due to the pending merger. Mark? Mark Dentinger Thank you, Alfred. Our merger with Oracle is subject to both regulatory and shareholder approval, and my comments do not address what effect the merger announcement had on our Q4 results nor what effect it may have on our future results. Because of uncertainty during dependency period, we will not be taking any questions on this call, nor will we be issuing any guidance about out future financial performance. If you have questions about my prepared remarks, please contact our investor relation group. With respect to certain financial data discussed today and corresponding data, presented material posted on our website is helpful to understand the following framework about our results. Non-GAAP presentations of our financial results of operations are derived directly from our GAAP statements. Our standard non-GAAP adjustments are based on the conventions of most businesses in our industry, and exclude the following from GAAP earnings; FAS 123(NYSE: R ) expenses on stock option issuances and discounts on employee stock purchase plan; in-process R&D and amortization of deferred compensation and other intangibles associated with acquisitions; and any income or expense items which are not expected to be recurring, such as gains or losses on a impairment or disposal of assets, restructurings and unusual tax items. These standard non-GAAP adjustments are shown in our publication called Quarter in Review, which is posted on our website. Additionally, three other phenomena, the restatement of our financials; 409A taxes, and advisor fees associated with the merger are affecting our current and recent GAAP earnings, which we do not expect to be a part of our long-term cost structure. Therefore, our non-GAAP earnings also exclude following expenses: any restatement charges or credits impacting our reported results for the last two year; third party expenses associated with completing the stock option investigation and restatement; non-cash charges for modifying stock awards and cash bonuses paid to employees in Q4 fiscal 2007, both of which were designed to mitigate the impact on our employees from not being able to sell their stock during the restatement period; advisory and legal fees arising from activities leading up to our announced merger with Oracle; and payment to employees, former employees and tax agencies to remedy our current former employees' exposure to 409A taxes. These additional non-GAAP adjustments are shown in the publication Supplement Quarter in Review, which is also posted on our website. With this framework in mind, let me start by discussing our non-GAAP income statement results. Revenue for the quarter was $440.9 million, up 13% year-over-year. License revenue was $179.5 million or 41% of total revenue, and services revenue was $261.4 million or 59% of total revenue. License revenue increased by 6% from last year's Q4 and services revenue increased 17%. The largest component of services revenue customer support was $206 million, an 18% increase compared to last year's Q4. Consulting and education revenues were $56 million in Q4, up 15% from last year. Geographically, the Americas region generated 48% of our Q4 revenue, which is down four percentage points from last year's Q4. Internationally, our EMEA business contributed 36% of total revenues, a two percentage point improvement from a year ago, and Asia-Pacific was 16% of revenues, a 2 point improvement from last year. By product, the AquaLogic family contributed 27% of our Q4 licensed revenue, versus 25% in Q4 of last year. The WebLogic and Tuxedo families contributed 73% of our licensed revenue in Q4, versus 75% Q4 of last year. Q4 total license transaction count of 2,531 decreased approximately 3% from last year, and our average transaction size increased by approximately 9%. For Q4, industry vertical performance was as follows. Government was 20% of licensed revenue, telecommunications was 16%, software was 14%, banking and finance was 11%. Other verticals were individually less than 10% of licensed revenues for the quarter. Our aggregate backlog at January 31, 2008 is $558 million, and includes deferred revenue from unexpired maintenance contracts, $449 million; deferred revenue from undelivered consulting and education orders, $23 million; deferred revenue for license orders which have shipped but have not met revenue recognition requirements, $5 million; off balance sheet license orders received but not shipped, $35 million; and off balance sheet services orders received and not delivered, $46 million. Our aggregate backlog at January 31, 2007 was $500 million, of which $449 was included on our balance sheet as deferred revenue. We did not believe that off balance sheet backlog as of any particular date directly co-relates to future results. As noted -- also note that our off balance sheet backlog is not subject to our normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in, or derived from, our basic financial statements. Finally, the concept of backlog is not to find any accounting literature, making comparisons with other company is difficult and potentially misleading. Now, let me address costs and expenses. Non-GAAP costs of licenses were 5.4% of license revenue in Q4, up from 4.8% in Q4 of last year. Cost of services was 28.8% of services revenue, compared to 29.5% Q4 of last year. Total operating expenses for Q4 were $236.7 million or 53.7% of total revenue, compared with $225.4 million in Q4 of last year or 57.5% of total revenue. Sales and marketing expense was $146.5 million or 33.2% of total revenue in Q4, compared with $138.8 million or 35.4% last year. R&D expense was 13.2% of revenue in Q4, compared to 14.4% of revenue in Q4 of last year. G&A expenses, at 7.3% of revenue in Q4, were down from 7.7% of revenue last year. Our Q4 non-GAAP operating profit was $119.3 million compared with $92.5 million a year ago. Expressed as a percentage our Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 27.1%, up from 23.6% a year ago. Our non-GAAP other income and expense, or OIE, increased to $15.6 million in Q4 versus $10.4 million in Q4 of last year. The OIE improvement was largely the result of reduced interest expense on our line-of-credit borrowings. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 27.5% of pre-tax non-GAAP income in Q4 compared to 34.4% in Q4 of last year. We expect our intermediate-term non-GAAP tax rate to approximate 27% to 29% based upon current earnings distribution, but the quarterly rate can fluctuate based upon specific items that arise or settle in each period. After making the previously mentioned non-GAAP adjustments, fourth quarter net income on a non-GAAP basis was $0.23 per share or $97.8 million, versus $0.16 a share in Q4 of last year. A fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding used in our Q4 '08 EPS calculation was 423.5 million, and the share number used in last year Q4 non GAAP EPS calculation was 414 million. Our Q4 result would have been approximately 4% lower in total revenue, 3% lower in cost of revenues, and 3% lower in operating expenses, if we translated the current quarter at currency exchange rate in effect last year. We were also profitable on a GAAP basis during Q4, recording fully-diluted EPS of $0.18, compared to $0.25 per share of loss in Q4 of last year. The large GAAP loss in last year's Q4 resulted from $200 million asset impairment write-down on vacant property in San Jose headquarters, which was sold in Q1 of fiscal of '08. Part of our GAAP earnings in Q4 of fiscal '08, we absorbed the following additional pre tax charges--$1.5 million for external expenses associated with the options investigation and restatement; advisory and legal expenses of $10.3 million for merger related activities; approximately $3 million in charges for stock repricing which is part of the Q4 tender offered to employees impacted by 409A, and approximately $2.8 million for payments to former employees and tax agencies to remedy 409A issues. Now, let me address our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total cash investments of about of about $1.5 billion, and we generated $123 million in cash flow from operations during Q4. In the same quarter last year, our operating cash flow was negative $3 million, largely because of a one-time $99 million reclassification out of operating cash flow and into cash flows financing activity. As discussed last quarter, this reclassification results from adopting FAS 123( R ) in fiscal 2007, combined with the fact that BEA drew down evaluation results against deferred taxes assets for the first in Q4 of '07. Had we not recorded the one-time adjustment, cash flow from operations in last year's Q4 would have been $95 million. DSO at the end of Q4 was 81 days, compared with 91 days at the end of Q4 of last year. Our deferred revenue balance was $477 million at the end of Q4, compared with $449 million at the end of Q4 of last year. Total headcount was essentially unchanged during Q4, and we exited the quarter with 4,117 employees. Thank you for joining us today, and now let me turn it back to Alfred. Alfred Chuang Thanks Mark. So, now, let me give some of my thoughts on our Q4 and fiscal 2008 results. In Q4, every geographic region hit the budget and grew year-over-year. Asia-pacific continues to the lead the way, with 45% growth in license orders. China, continue to deliver strong growth. We also had strong performances in ASEAN, India, and Australia and New Zealand. We continue to view Asia-Pacific as a leading growth opportunity. Our performance in Americas was led by the North Central region, South Central region, Federal and Latin America. Our EMEA performance was led by the U.K and Spain. EMEA delivered a strong performance in May budget, inspired by two large deals that slipped late in the quarter. Demand for our products was very strong in Q4. Tuxedo had a big Q4, and grew slightly for the full year. WebLogic Server performance improved in Q4 as well. Customers for our foundational technologies included ALTEC, eHarmony, Intec Billing and Research in Motion. Portal and BPM continue to provide the interface to SOA projects. Our SOA, our portal business, grew 11%, two percentage points faster than industry analysts estimate the portal is growing. AquaLogic BPM sustained the last year's momentum, delivering 47% growth this year. Portal and BPM customers in the quarter included Cingular Wireless, Petroleo Brasileiro, Research in Motion, ScrewFix and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. For the last few years, we've talked about SOA Governance and Integration as a key trend. Those trends continue to drive customer's option of BEA technology in Q4. Our AquaLogic integration products delivered 18% growth for the year. In Q4, SOA Governance revenue once again doubled year-over-year. For the full fiscal year, SOA Governance delivered 140% growth. SOA Governance and Integration customers in Q4 included Cigna, Comagas, Sempra Energy, TIAA-CREF, United Airlines and Vivo. WebLogic communication platform had the best bookings quarter ever. The market emphasis on opening up networks to third-party content provides as well as the integration of communication with Web 2.0 provides an important market opportunity for WLCP. In addition, this quarter we saw a market opportunity, we did not expect for WLCP. One of our large customers is rewriting software from their core network onto the WebLogic SIP Server. We expect the WLCP to serve next-generation voice, video and data networks. But we did not expect Telcos to migrate core network elements. This customer, in conjunction with BEA and one of our customers, is building software-driven smart switches in the hardware network. Migrating their Class 4 switches to Linux Blade servers, WLCP customers in the quarter included France Telecom, Alcatel, Italtel, and a large US carrier. In addition, we continue to make progress with our new Virtualization products. In Q4, we announced WebLogic Liquid Operations Control, a management suite that goes with WebLogic Logic Server Virtualization Edition. We also shipped a new version of the WLS Virtue Edition, which tests have shown can actually run a virtualized application faster than a physical application. We have received several orders for CPOs, and the pipeline grew dramatically after the release of the new version of the product. Yesterday at VMware EMEA, BEA and VMware announced the distribution partnership, where BEA Virtualization technology will be embedded in VMware products. Let me give you more details on how customers are using our products. Dell Computer is undergoing a major transformation as an organization. To drive the transformation, Dell is building an enterprise-wide SOA platform accessed by all the company's major business units, based on BEA’s technology. Dell underwent a rigorous competitive evaluation, and selected BEA as a primary technology for this new platform. Dell purchased the entire AquaLogic product family, as well as our Virtualization technology. Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a global biotechnology company committed to the discovery and development of breakthrough small molecule drugs for serious disease, focusing on bio diseases, cancer, autoimmune disease and bacterial infections. Vertex selected AquaLogic use interaction and BPM Suite as a platform for collaboration with researchers in both research and regulatory approval process. eHarmony, the online dating site is siphoning 70 million registered users, and growing in excess of 45% annually. They selected BEA as a foundation because of the scalability, reliability, and performance that are crucial to user experience, as well as the ability to seamlessly implement application upgrades. United Airlines chose BEA as partners as they move forward with a major new SOA initiative. United is in an increasingly competitive environment requiring great agility, and an improved ability to innovate and meet the evolving needs of traveling public. With enterprise-wide SOA initiative powered by Weblogic Server, Weblogic portal and the complete AquaLogic product family, United will provide such unique offerings as self-served baggage tracking, and automated upsell award redemption system. This system exceeded 1,500 transactions per second during the proof-of-concept process. SOA Governance will be used throughout the lifecycle of this initiative. This initiative is designed to allow United's IT departments to drive measurable results for the business, in the form of reduced costs, minimized risk and much faster time to market. La Caixa is a major savings bank in Spain, and one of the largest in Europe, with around 10 million customers, and more than 5,000 branches, as one of the most successful online banking systems in Spain, which has been powered by Weblogic Server since it was launched in 2000. As part of a global strategy to reengineer software architecture and application for its branches, La Caixa decided to replace an existing high TCO infrastructure with an extension of the WebLogic Server environment aided by BEA Consulting Services. BEA won this architectural deal in competition with IBM. As an early lead in SOA, we can see that SOA is in the first step of the journey to the creation of a new class of dynamic business applications that will enable enterprises to innovate much more quickly. Enterprises have spent billions of dollars installing packaged software applications, only to find that the standardized business logic inside merely accelerates their path to becoming average. True business innovation is happening outside the packaged application, and BEA is at the forefront of enabling enterprises, ISVs, to design a new breed of dynamic business applications. The first phase of Project Genesis, BEA's initiative to deliver a dynamic business application platform, is scheduled to ship in the middle of this year. Now, let me comment on the proposed merger with Oracle. Yesterday, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino review period for the proposed merger. Also, as recently announced, BEA has scheduled a special meeting of stockholders to consider and vote on the proposed merger. The meeting is scheduled to be held at 10 am Pacific time on Friday, April 4, 2008. The transaction will require BEA stockholder approval and regulatory clearances from the European Commission, and is subject to other closing conditions. BEA and Oracle are working towards obtaining all required clearances as soon as possible. Before I conclude, let me summarize. Here is what I see as key themes of the quarter and our financial results. First, we delivered a record quarter and returned to license revenue growth. Second, customers continue to adopt BEA technology as a platform for SOA and other major enterprise projects, and share our vision for dynamic business applications, the next generation of enterprise computing beyond SOA. Third, we've continued to make significant improvements in our operating efficiency reflected in both our operating margins and our operating cash flows. We believe in our strategy, future prospects and ability to execute. During this time, as the merge with Oracle is pending regulatory review and shareholder approval, the Company is focused on executing our growth strategy, improving our operating model and making our customers successful. This concludes our call. Thank you very much for joining us today. Operator Once again, thank you all very much for joining us. That does conclude today's presentation. Have a great afternoon.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. In addition, a webcast of this conference call will also be available on Baidu's IR website. I will now turn the call over to Baidu's CEO, Robin Li. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining today's call. Earlier today, we announced that Jennifer will become CEO of Baidu Capital, an investment firm. Jennifer will transition away from her responsibilities as CFO, following the appointment of her successor. Jennifer has played an instrumental role in Baidu's growth over the nine years she has been our CFO. And as CEO of Baidu Capital, she will continue to be part of the Baidu family and contribute to building Baidu's ecosystem, which is crucial in bringing AI to real world applications. Jennifer's extensive experience in the area of finance, capital markets, technology, auto, financial services, and consumer industries will help bridge technology as well as traditional industries. And I look forward to working with Jennifer in her new capacity. Now, turning to the quarter. I will begin with a few brief comments, and then Qi will provide a business review, and Jennifer will present the financials. 2017 is shaping up to be a transformational year for Baidu, as we complete our strategic evolution to China's largest AI-centric technology company. We believe that a great technological revolution comparable to the industrial revolution is taking shape, representing a once-in-a generation opportunity that will create new commercial frontiers and transform a wide range of industries, such as auto, healthcare, education, financial services, and industrial automation. In the AI enabled era, the scenarios for human machine interaction will be much broader than what we've seen before. And as natural language understanding and image recognition power new information gateways, the new paradigms for human machine interaction will have significant implications for how people conduct their daily lives. I'm confident that Baidu's advantages in technology, specifically advanced AI research will position us to be the industry leader for the long-term. Search is one of the first applications of AI where search works to understand human. As the leading search engine in China, we have been fortunate to amass vast amounts of rich, valuable data in a market with over 700 million Internet users who speak the same language, have the same culture, and abide by the same laws. Moreover, we live in an age where we can finally match this data with powerful efficient computing infrastructure, and a deep bench of talent to make real progress in AI. We believe Baidu's opportunity to apply AI to real world consumer and enterprise applications in China is enormous. We envision a world where machines continue to learn about humans. In the not so distant future, using natural voice input or images to interact with machines will be mainstream, alleviating humans of the burden of mutant tasks. We imagine a world where your face is your identity and you only need to show your face to pay at the supermarket or goes through airport security. Cars will drive us, freeing up our time and attention. As machines become more like hyper efficient, real-time assistants for people, the mode of user interaction is evolving correspondingly. Just as the mouse and keyboard were the gateways in the PC era and touch is the gateway for mobile, voice recognition through conversational DuerOS will be the gateway in the China plus AI era. Our investment in AI is a long-term proposition with dividends that will be paid over the medium to long term. We're already seeing the powerful benefit of AI in our existing online advertising platform and in a more personalized, more image enhanced and more predictive search experience. Beyond the existing PC and mobile channels, AI will expand the scenarios and use cases for search in home, car, and work, and lower the friction for search through voice recognition, image recognition, and user personalization. Our strategy is clear and we're working hard on multiple fronts. I'll now turn the call over to Qi to go through our business progress. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Robin. To build on Robin's key points, operationally here at Baidu, we very much focus on building and applying AI technologies as the foundation of what we do, and the primary driver of product innovation and business growth. Over the past three months, I have spent the majority of my time working with our product and business teams to map out our strategy and the ways to drive high-performance execution. Our focus is two-fold, to enhance and expand our existing core business platform, and to lead the commercialization of AI technology across a number of AI-enabled new business initiatives, such as our AI-cloud, financial services, DuerOS, and autonomous driving. For our new business initiatives, we have gone through a rigorous and disciplined process to evaluate and select the most promising new business opportunities to pursue. Our criteria includes, category lifecycle, market penetration, Baidu's competitive position, differentiated value propositions, and our ability to execute. We will be shedding more light on the process and the progress of these new business initiatives, and sharing operating metrics as appropriate as we move forward. On our core business front, we are off to a good start, driving improvements in both traditional core search, as well as in our news feed product. Search is and will continue to be a fundamental user need, especially as we digitize more and more world information in our daily lives. We see much more room for innovation to deliver a better user experience with richer information using interactions as we expand search into more and more scenarios. For example, we are making great strides in enriching our search results, especially with video. In fact, now over 25% of mobile queries have rich video content as part of the search results, representing a material increase over last year. We are also making our search experience on mobile devices more natural and easy to navigate using touch. The experience is much more engaging, like that of our mobile native apps as compared to the traditional browser-based experience. This is achieved through intelligent filtering and the presentation technologies, based on our AI capabilities, in content and user intent understanding especially in more advanced areas, such as classification and object recognition in images and videos. With the twin engines of search and news feed, we have broadened our core product experience by complementing the explicit intent-driven, pull experience of the traditional search with implicit user understanding-driven, push experience of news feed. While we are pleased with the rapid user adoption of our news feed product with daily active users reaching 83 million this month, and the overall volumes of content distributions and the user time spent reaching a new weekly high, we will stay laser-focused on improving the user experience and building out our content platform, especially the number of content creators on our Baijiahao content platform has surpassed 450,000, more than doubling over last quarter, becoming an increasingly important part of the Baidu overall information ecosystem. Now, speak of ecosystem. Maps, Nuomi, and the Local Express continue to play a vital role in connecting users with local content and services, and helping local businesses connect with users through our search, feed and advertising products. Operationally in Q1, we consolidated Nuomi into our core business. Going forward, our focus for Nuomi will be building more and a better content of our local services and the monetization through advertising through Local Express, instead of just transactional business. All of these improvements to our core products and ecosystem are reflected in the growing engagement of our users, with the ratio of mobile search daily active users to monthly active users showing a clear upward trend. On the commercial product front, we added upgrades to our search ad platform, making click to connect ad formats available across search, Union and the news feed. This has yielded a notable lift in monetization. We are also actively developing and applying AI technologies across a number of key areas such as ad targeting, creative and landing page optimization, which will contribute to increasing monetization capabilities over time. While monetization is still at an early stage for news feed, customer feedback has been very positive, they view news feed traffic as incremental to their campaigns. Late last year, we also launched a dedicated news feed ad platform to complement news feed bidding within our search ad platform, and customer campaigns through this dedicated channel is ramping up at a rapid rate. Now turning to AI-enabled and new business initiatives. We are making good strides across the board, and here a few specific areas to call out. DuerOS is our next-generation conversational AI platform. By design, it provides powerful capabilities to enable the use of voice in natural language to interact with any digital experience on any device, for any scenario. This is because for the first time in our history, AI technology enables natural language to serve as a general purpose user interface. While it is still early, this platform will have enormous potential relative to the traditional platforms, because it can run everywhere, and it enable users to interact naturally and easily. We believe we are the clear market leader in China. DuerOS has already gained great momentum in building out its ecosystem. For example, we have secured broad partnership to power conversational AI services for Xiaomi and the Vivo smartphones, Lenovo smart TV, Haier, and Midea smart appliances, HARMAN smart speakers and many others across rapidly growing number of devices. Home and cars are two high value scenarios to anchor the DuerOS platform at this early phase. Here we have made important investments in our Raven Tech acquisitions, as well as our Internet of Vehicles business unit. Both of which will help further establish the DuerOS platform and strengthen our market leadership position. At the same time, both in their own right will have significant business opportunities that we will grow into. In Q1, we consolidate our L4 and L3 and Internet of Vehicle Business Unit into the new IDG, Intelligent Driving Group. This will enable us to build out a common technology platform, shared services, and a consistent solution for all our partners. At the Shanghai Auto Fair last week, we announced project Apollo, an open, complete, and reliable autonomous driving technology platform that we plan to launch in July. This is a historical opportunity to apply our AI technology strength to create an open innovation ecosystem that will empower all parties in the auto industry to accelerate the pace of innovation, enable more win-win partnerships, create greater business opportunities in this vast and rapidly growing market. The response from the industry and our partners has been very positive thus far. It is a big step forward. Our AI-cloud business named as ABC or AI Big Data and Cloud has been gaining traction with our customers, who appreciate our AI value-added approach. Baidu Cloud builds upon foundation of cloud solutions of computing, storage and CDN. We differentiate by providing AI technology enabled solutions, such as Big Data, deep learning, video, IoT and more. Customers across media, financial services, healthcare and other verticals have expressed very positive feedback. This month at the Baidu Cloud ABC summit, together with NVIDIA, we announced the establish of the Baidu Deep Learning platform which will greatly help our customers and partners to enhance their capability in Deep Learning and AI. Our Financial Services business continues to grow as our AI and Big Data capabilities serve as key differentiators that can intelligently target and match users with the right products, identify and prevent fraud and appropriately assess credit risk through our continuously increasing proprietary data and modeling capabilities. iQiyi, which celebrated its seventh anniversary this month, continued its sector leadership with ongoing improvements in revenue and paid subscriber numbers. In March, according to iResearch, iQiyi's mobile app maintained its top ranking with 129 million daily active users, 490 million monthly active users, and 342 billion minutes of monthly user time. We will continue to work closely with iQiyi to support its growth as part of the overall Baidu ecosystem. Baidu Deliveries with its first rate service quality and clear technology advantage made a strong progress in the quarter, seeing healthy revenue growth year-over-year. In March, during the International Women's Week, Baidu Deliveries ran a highly successful special joint promotion with Yum China's KFC and the Pizza Hut brands. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our progress in Q1, and we are more confident and energized about using AI to elevate our core products and the business and to create long-term values through our next-generation AI enabled new business initiatives. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to go through the financials. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Qi. Hello, everyone. In the first quarter, we bought back about $200 million of our own stock. We are very confident in Baidu's long-term outlook, and this decision is consistent with our overall capital allocation framework. We had a solid first quarter with the business performing to our expectations. As we're moving from mobile first to AI first, we work to align our business operations by folding Nuomi into our core business. Nuomi will play a role to serve as part of the core business' content and service ecosystem. We'll continue to scale back spend for Nuomi, and shift Nuomi from a take-rate transaction based business model to an advertising-based business model, which leverages our core business. We do not expect Nuomi to be a significant contributor to margin drag going forward. Other components in Transaction Services such as Maps, Financial Services, and Baidu Deliveries are also part of our core businesses content and service ecosystem, with Financial Services and Baidu Deliveries very much leveraging our AI capabilities. Baidu Deliveries continues to show improving operational efficiency, and a visible path to sustainability and profitability. Consistent with our strategic and operational focus to build our core business and invest in AI, we intend to realign our segment reporting, and fold Transaction Services into our core business. Starting next quarter, we'll report Baidu Core as a whole and Transaction Services will no longer be a separate segment. As Robin and Qi have shared, and as we have been communicating to you in the past few quarters, AI is the core of our strategy, and is both the foundation of our existing platform and driver of vast opportunities going forward. We are continuously leveraging our existing technology capabilities, and devoting resources to our AI-enabled initiatives of enterprise cloud, financial services, DuerOS and autonomous driving. The majority of these investments are on the R&D front, which we expect to bear fruit in the medium to longer term. This year, we expect incremental R&D expenses over 2016 to be all related to AI. Incremental R&D spend this year is largely related to AI R&D head count. As a reminder, as disclosed in our 20-F form, we disposed of our mobile gaming business for RMB 1.2 billion, a transaction which is expected to close mid-May. After mid-May, we will no longer recognize revenue for the mobile gaming business. The mobile gaming business contributed close to 3% of total revenue in 2016. Now moving to the financials, all monetary amounts are in RMB unless otherwise stated. For the first quarter, total revenues were RMB 16.9 billion, representing a 6.8% increase from the corresponding period in 2016. During the first quarter, Baidu had approximately 451,000 active online marketing customers, representing a 23% decrease from the corresponding period in 2016 and flat compared to the previous quarter. Revenue per online marketing customer for the first quarter was RMB 32,200, a 27% increase from the corresponding period in 2016, and a 9% decrease compared to the prior quarter. Traffic acquisition cost as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 was RMB 2.2 billion, representing a 12.9% of total revenues compared to 14.1% in the corresponding period in 2016, and 14.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Bandwidth costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 1.3 billion, representing 7.9% of total revenues compared to 6.9% in the corresponding period in 2016. Depreciation costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 823 million, representing 4.9% of total revenues compared to 4.5% in Q1 of 2016. Operational costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 959 million, representing 5.7% of total revenue compared to 6.9% in Q1 last year. Content costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 2.6 billion, representing 15.6% of total revenue, compared to 8.7% in the corresponding period in 2016. This increase was mainly due to iQiyi's increased content costs. SG&A expenses in Q1 were RMB 2.8 billion, representing a decrease of 29% from corresponding period in 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in promotional spending for transaction services. R&D expenses in Q1 were RMB 2.8 billion, a 35% increase over the corresponding period in 2016. The increase was mainly due to growth of R&D personnel related expenses. Share-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating and expense line items, increased in aggregate to RMB 631 million in Q1 from RMB 309 million in the corresponding period in 2016. This year-over-year increase was a result of increased share grants to employees. Operating profit for Q1 was RMB 2 billion, representing a 9.3% decrease from the corresponding period in 2016. Non-GAAP operating profit was RMB 2.6 billion, a 4.6% increase over the corresponding period in 2016. Income tax expenses was RMB 405 million for the first quarter. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 18.6% compared to 25.4% in Q1 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate reflected our operating loss narrowed for some loss-generating entities in the group. Net income attributable to Baidu for Q1 was RMB 1.8 billion, a 10.6% decrease from the corresponding period in 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per ADS for the first quarter amounted to RMB 4.65 and RMB 4.63, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu for Q1 was RMB 2.4 billion, a 1.3% increase year-on-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS for Q1 was RMB 6.85. As of Q1, the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB 90.7 billion. Net operating cash flow (sic) [inflow] (28:38) and capital expenditures for the first quarter were RMB 4.7 billion and RMB 1.2 billion, respectively. Total head count on a consolidated basis including invested entities was about 43,400, as of the end of first quarter of 2017. This represents a decrease of 5.5% as compared to the end of last year (sic) [quarter] (29:04). Now let me provide you with our top-line guidance for the second quarter of 2017. We currently expect total revenue for the second quarter to be between RMB 20.47 billion and RMB 20.98 billion, representing an annual increase of 12.1% to 14.9% and the sequential increase of 21.2% to 24.2%. Please note, this forecast reflects Baidu's current and preliminary view, and is subject to change. I will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. The question-and-answer session of this conference call will start in a moment. Your first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Eddie Leung - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, good morning. First of all, my best wishes to Jennifer for your next role. And then for my questions, I'm wondering if you could share more color with us on the different components of your revenue guidance for the second quarter, especially any color on the contribution of our subscription and the newer business, mobile news feed will be helpful? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi, Eddie. Thank you for your kind words. With regards to Q2 revenue, as you look at our business, essentially it's the core business as well as iQiyi that are the main revenue contributors. Within the core business, there is search, we're also putting a lot of efforts in the feed. The feed product, as Qi mentioned earlier, from a user adoption perspective, it's progressing very well. We're in the early stage of monetizing the product. So we had not been very much focused on or driving aggressively on the monetization front. So for our core business, it continues to be very search centric, and we are very excited to expand the service we can offer to our users and advertisers, and we expect a solid progress in that regard, and we should expect the search business to extend over the next few quarters. For the iQiyi business, as you would have seen from our 20-F, last year iQiyi had a very solid growth and the contribution to our overall business. iQiyi is integral part of the overall Baidu ecosystem, and they continue to deliver very strong top-line growth driven by the business model of the subscription user base. So if you look at Q2, sequentially, you continue – Q1, sequentially you continue to observe other revenue line continues to grow quarter-on-quarter, and a big part of that is iQiyi's a subscription user business. So iQiyi's revenue growth is on solid ground, the two engine advertising as well as subscription fees continue to grow very well. So we're still on the path of recovery from last year's incident, and search is ramping up very nicely. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang from HSBC. Please go ahead. Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Good morning, everybody, and again congratulations, Jennifer, on this next opportunity. I wanted to ask you about core search. In particular, I was wondering if you can touch on traffic as well as demand. On the traffic front, what are you guys seeing in terms of growth in traffic and maybe growth in paid clicks year-to-date? And I'm wondering, if you expect paid clicks to grow faster this year than last year? And then, in terms of demand, given the rebasing of your customer base, as well as with higher standards, what type of customer growth do you expect this year? Thanks so much. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I'm going to take the first cut on Chi's question, and Qi and Robin can feel free to add. The traffic as overall continues to be very solid, mobile continues to be growing nicely, and a bigger proportion of the overall traffic. As you know, I mentioned earlier, the feed product is also we're busy developing that and seeing good progress on that. So from our product service perspective, we have the nicer search traffic as well as user engagement, that user has more time and interesting topics that they can view on the Baidu platform. For us to build in more of these inventories, it create more of the user products, it provides a bigger advertising pool and inventory for our advertisers. So I think going into 2017, later in the quarter, we should continue to expect that the paid clicks will power the growth of monetization. From a – the other question? Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Customers, yeah. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Customer, customer wise also, I think seasonally Q1 was a low quarter, and I think for the remainder of the year, as we have richer product for our advertisers and our sales force, refocus their efforts to develop the market, we should expect the customer base to grow as well. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me just add to what Jennifer described. With regard to search traffic, as we mentioned earlier, we view search as a fundamental human need, user need, and as we digitize more and more information, digitize more and more daily activities, the search overall demand will increase, that's number one. Number two, in current forms user express their intent through keywords, query input, landing on a set of information that will see its natural pace of growth as you have seen – our industry in China has been expanding so far. However, what I'll emphasize there is through AI technology innovations, we believe we can over time expand our search traffic by additional user experiences, for example you can search based on voice, you can search based on image, and more and more content will be available for search. So our focus is tapping into the current trend of user traffic growth for sure. At the same time, focusing on building better experience, more search capabilities, expanding into more search scenarios over time to expand search traffic. On the click, paid click side, again the pattern will be similar. The focus would be using AI technologies to understand the user intent better, and enable that to expose to advertisers, to our business customers, so that advertisers will have over time richer opportunities to place their campaigns as part of product, so that we have more opportunities to tap into the ongoing growing demand of advertising needs. So netted out, there's existing forms that's growing at its current pace and we're also focusing on tapping into future user traffic and future paid click growth opportunities through AI, through technological based enablement. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Alicia Yap - Citigroup Hi. Thank you. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer and Dr. Lu. Thanks for taking my questions. My questions is related to margins, so your comments of the operating margin including Baidu Core versus the Transaction Service, where Transaction Service 16.8% point reduction, does that mean in Q1, the margin on the Transaction Service only include the Baidu Takeout Delivery and the Map, but the Nuomi expenses is now part of the Baidu Core. And then how should we be thinking about the overall core margins in the future with news feed becoming a more meaningful part of the contributions? And then related to that, I wanted to ask about the content costs on the iQiyi front, is all the RMB 2.6 billion in Q1 is all related to iQiyi? Is there anything on that is related to the news feed content? And then with iQiyi recent licensing deal with Netflix, does the content cost guidance of doubling year-over-year this year still hold true, or should we expect even more than double in the content costs? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Alicia. So a few questions. First of all, the margin drag that we reported on Transaction Services was reported on the same concept and definition, consistent with the prior quarters. This is to give you an idea, and you can clearly see that we're reducing the investments on this front and we're shifting from mobile to AI. And so for your specific comment, Nuomi was included in this number and included in the Transaction Services, as a reminder, also has Financial Services, Baidu Delivery, Map and Nuomi, and so these are the main components. As I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to reduce spend on Nuomi and the other elements within the old transaction services sector has to do with core search or AI related initiatives. So, it doesn't really make sense for Transaction Service to stand as a separate sector, but for your information it's more to giving you an indication for this quarter that we are reducing spend on this front. For news feed, as mentioned before, news feed carries a different margin profile, and we're in the early stage of developing its business model from an advertising perspective. Currently, we're focusing on driving the user experience, user adoption, so investment related to feed has to do with the ecosystem buildup, content acquisition, R&D efforts, and some you can say infrastructure related, bandwidth and depreciation related to servers, because we're building the user traffic on the front. We haven't really focused on the advertising effort, but as Qi mentioned earlier, the business model is pretty apparent and the customers are quite open and acceptive to this advertising model. So, over time, we will ramp up the advertising and monetization capability. But at this point, it's very early stage. With regards to the content cost for Q1, yes, predominantly a biggest of majority of the Q1 content expense was iQiyi related. And as we mentioned earlier, our expectation is this year there will be a very important content investment mainly for iQiyi and also partly related to our feed product. The overall guidance we provided earlier that the content cost will likely go up the same percentage as before that estimate is still hold. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Alan Hellawell - Deutsche Bank AG (Hong Kong) Great. I just wanted to join the chorus in thanking Jennifer for setting a high watermark in the industry as a CFO, and also wish her the very best in her new role. A question around the interplay between demand for our search and news feed products. I can see key accounts scratching up new incremental budget to buy news feed ad, but I wonder if it is more cannibalistic to our budget limited SMEs that generally prefer the more focused sales generation aspects of buying a keyword to the more impression based aspect of news feed ad. And then just a quickie, a disclosure-related question. By folding in Transaction Services to Core search, are we no longer going to segregate out margin drag from Transaction Services and maybe even iQiyi? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first answer the first part of the question about on the demand side. The evidence so far has been showing a overall healthy growth and a specific evidence, I'll call out, is that, we have enabled our customers to place their campaign and budget in two ways. One is through their search campaign, they can indicate how much to go to the feeds, and there is also a separate interface that they can explicitly say, these budget will be on the feed side. There's a clear upward trend, a very rapid growth for customers, explicitly placing more campaign budget on the feed side, while maintaining their search campaign, search budget, and that's a clear signs of healthy growth, overall growth for our advertising needs for combined search and the feed products, number one. Number two, over time, we'll become more apparent that feed in many ways enable brand advertising to have a meaningful play at platforms. This is again very early. We're more focused on getting user experience to be truly, truly compelling and grow our user base and time spent. But from campaign demand perspective, our combined search and feed will enable more overall growth, not just from the traditional performance-based advertising into brand awareness based advertising as well. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And Alan, to your second question, yes, we're folding Transaction Services into Core, however, we will continue to separately identify iQiyi as a separate segment and report separately its margin impact on a quarterly basis. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Alex Yao - JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the Apollo project you guys announced recently. Does that make your autonomous car research project, open source type of the project, which will potentially impact your monetization capability. If it's not, can you help us understand your future project for monetizing the autonomous car driving initiative? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. That's a terrific question. As a matter of fact, I can tell you, my goal for project Apollo is to expand our monetization opportunities ahead, a real plausible path towards future economic value creation for Baidu. Specifically, let me give you the thumbnail of what Apollo is and comment on the business opportunities. First of all, as I described, it's open and compete in the reliable platforms. So we're open code, we're open software and then we're also open capabilities that through APIs. And we're also providing core services as the overall part of the platforms. The overarching design is any players in the auto industry with Apollo, you can put together the complete vehicle using off the shelf hardware components, and be able to run with different intelligent driving scenarios, and all the way up until 2020, towards fully autonomous driving. So that's the overarching vision by design. It's open innovation ecosystem. The key here is design point of that ecosystem, because the epic innovation center for the auto industry will be in data, in algorithms, in rapid pace of innovations towards intelligent driving. And Apollo is designed in that way, and I can tell you my personal experience, the Hadoop ecosystem, the core base come from my Yahoo! teams. And I personally witnessed through if you picked the right design point for the industry, you can tap into the vast growth and emphasize vast growth a win-win with all partners, and yet at the same times enable Baidu to tap into the economic opportunities. Now without going into the specifics, what I can point to you is, there is known ways of monetizing open networks, whether it's services, packaged softwares, components, solutions, all these options are available to Baidu to tap into. That's number one. Number two, the response from auto partners from industries has been, I could say, overwhelmingly positive, and our confidence of our ability to tap into the new rapid growth through the Apollo ecosystem and our ability to monetize is increased substantially, going forward. So it's a terrific question. Baidu not only want to enable a healthy ecosystem, but let's all make money in our way and grow the whole pie together. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Juan Lin from 86Research. Please go ahead. Juan Lin - 86Research Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Lu, and congratulations Jennifer on the new role. I have a question on the mobile gaming business. You mentioned that revenue contribution of mobile gaming business is around 3% of total revenue. I'm wondering what is the contribution to our profit. And after disconnecting this business, are you going to monetize the mobile game related traffic, which was previously directed to the mobile gaming business? Do you think that disconnecting business will eventually lead to a more efficient usage of your traffic in terms of monetization? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi. Mobile game, yes, as I said earlier, it contributed close to 3% of revenue last year. The game business operate, as you can see, is relatively small in our overall picture, and it doesn't generate the kind of margin as we do from our main business. So this transaction is actually a very good transaction for both us and the parties involved, and also it brings some good level of gains for us. For us, mobile game sector is always a very attractive sector for advertising business. And we do expect that even in the past, with mobile game operations, we have game advertising income and going forward, we will continue to develop this market and grow the mobile game advertiser base. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please go ahead. Natalie Wu - CICC Hi. Good morning, management. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, I want to extend my best regards to Jennifer on her new role. And my question is regarding the margin of the Core business excluding Transaction Service and iQiyi, which seems to be declined quite a lot in the first quarter despite savings from traffic acquisition costs. So just wondering is it mainly due to the AI-related investment, or is there any other factors behind that? And how should we look at the trend going forward? And also just a little bit clarification on the mobile game, so that the consolidation of mobile game business will be since mid-May, right, so that is to say your current guidance is reflecting half quarter's consolidation of the game-related revenue? Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. Yes, for Q1, I think a couple of factors to think about as you look at the margins for Core. Mainly for Core, a couple of things are going about. One is, we're still recovering from, for our search service from the last year's incident. It has not been fully recovered. We're on the good path, it's ramping up, it's performing as expected. The other thing is the investment related to feed. As I mentioned earlier, early stage in terms of monetization, but we are very focused on building feed as a very solid and good complementary product to our search service. Related to that, our bandwidth, depreciation, R&D, content cost and also channel distribution investment to help mobile Baidu be more prominent among the user base. So that's the other factor going in Q1. And the third element, as you mentioned, AI investment, you have seen R&D expense increased year-on-year. As I mentioned earlier, the incremental spend would all be related to AI initiatives. AI initiatives are an integral part of our core service. It build upon the core technology capabilities and infrastructure capabilities. So that's what's driving the Q1's margin performance. For your second question with regards to mobile games, yes, you are correct. So basically, as I mentioned earlier, mobile game contributed to Q1 overall financial performance, it will only have about half of that in the Q2 period. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. So, Jennifer, what I would just add to emphasize the AI investment part, the placeholder (53:03) I would like to emphasize is, we will be very disciplined and systematically optimize our resource allocations to make sure that our engineering investments and R&D investment is truly tap into the substantial growth opportunities ahead of us. And we're going through lot of work across different teams to make sure that our resource allocation utilization is fully optimized towards two fundamental focus. One is elevating our current core business, we see a lot of growth opportunities ahead, and at the same time accelerating the commercialization of AI-enabled business. So, being disciplined and being very systemically in optimization is very important to us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Piyush Mubayi - Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC Thank you for taking my question. First, Jennifer, congratulations on your new role. We wish you the best in your future endeavors. My question is directed to Qi at this point. We recognized that Baidu is strongly positioned in AI R&D. As the business model evolves in the medium-term, could you give us a glimpse into the range of operating metrics that become relevant, so we can better understand and appreciate the new world we're getting into? And very specifically as we go into a face, voice, and image recognition based world that AI would bring about versus the current search monetization model in place, how do you think that's going to change? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Well, thank you. Thank you for the questions. So, let me first comment on your first question with regard to operating metrics. First, myself, my teams are very, very focused on accelerating the commercialization of our AI-enabled new businesses, and because the core of AI technology is about efficiently extract knowledge from data, and our focus is first of all establish very, very compelling user scenarios, and users and usage are important part of metrics. And the second is the data and iteration (sic) [integration] (55:26) rate, how we can iterate (sic) [integrate] (55:28) based on the data that we have in our systems. And the third is rapidly explore business models and monetization capabilities. And adding up together, we are developing our overall operating frameworks and operating dashboards, these are the type of things, Jennifer, myself, our teams collectively look at every week, every months, and we're focusing on driving a disciplined and accelerated pace of execution on commercializing the AI initiative, AI-enabled new business initiatives. As I mentioned in my prepared speech earlier, as we move forward when appropriate, we will shed more light with the investor communities about those operating metrics, because it would take time to evolve, but what I can show you is our teams are staying very, very focused to be very disciplined and rigorous in accelerating our pace forward. With regard to your question about modality change, on the consumer side, our current view is that will not fundamentally affect the economic patterns, because even if you use voice instead of using keyboards, you still express your intent, and once we understand user intent, and we understand the content that users try to seek to access, we will be able to place match that in a good way, and existing models of advertising or other forms will be equally applicable in that scenario. So, at this stage, we do not see a fundamental shift even though modality may change, the economic opportunity in front of us will be equally compelling as we have seen up to this point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Karen Chan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Karen Chan - Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. Thank you management for taking my question. Congratulations to Jennifer on your new role. My first question is related to Core margins. So it is negatively impacted partly by the initial ramp up of mobile news feed ad. So how should we think about normalized margin level once the mobile news feed app reach a certain scalability? And my second question is regarding our monetization timeline of DuerOS apps with the AI-enabled home device partnership we secured. Wondering if management can share any color on that? Thanks. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thanks, Karen. I'll take the first part and Qi can help address the second. As I mentioned earlier, currently the margin doesn't reflect a true picture. I think we mentioned earlier, feed is a product that's going to carry a different margin profile. But overall, I think just purely focusing on margins is just one angle. It's more important to think about the overall service and revenue opportunities that we can generate because of the product of search. The core search continues to be a very fundamental need, and that business model is beautiful and scalable and high margin. First for feed to complement the search service, we give our advertisers a much bigger advertising inventory, and the advertisers, big or small, can have more budget allocated with us. So for us to think about feed because it is a push kind of product, it's different from search. The overall it's a mix, it's a more beautiful and more integrated, and richer service that we provide, and I think it's important to look at the bigger market value we can potentially tap. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me comment on the second part of question with regard to DuerOS monetization and its timeline. And here is how we think about DuerOS, its position in the industry, and now we shed light on how we think about monetization. First of all, DuerOS is the AI generation user experience platform, very similar to iOS and Android. iOS, Android is really for fingers, the device sitting in everybody's pocket. DuerOS, the fundamental interaction is natural language and voice based and it's everywhere. It's on every device, in every scenario. So it's a platform in that regard. The second, DuerOS is also a new entry point, because as you use DuerOS more and more in your home, in your car, say, play the next song for me, order pizza that becomes a new entry. So it plays dual role as a experienced platform, a new form of entry. On the entry side, the monetization is very natural. This is very similar to today's information gateway, like search. And the timeline will be the amount of scale that we can grow into, and there will be natural opportunities we can tap into. The second is about the platforms. Traditionally, there are several dimension with platform economics. If you look at iOS and Android, there is ways to run a app store type models, you can get economical value. There is VIG for the applications that builds on top of the platforms, and at the same time DuerOS also strategically bring additional demand to our ABC cloud. So we can also indirectly monetize through that vehicles. So having said all of that, our focus right now is really grow the ecosystem. We're doing a good job. Our team is really racing ahead, every day, every week, we're signing up new partners. So our focus is on scale. But as I said, we see ourselves as a clear leader in China and the opportunities over time will be tremendous. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Grace Chen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Grace Chen - Morgan Stanley Taiwan Ltd. Hello. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. The question is about the search business. From the Q2 sales guidance, we can see that the search sales should be recovering on both QoQ and then year-over-year basis. Can you help us understand what are the key drivers for the sales recovery in terms of market segments? And also can you comment on the competitive landscape, in the advertising business in general, for example, from like social and e-commerce peers? And also on the margin for search business, as we've just discussed that, we can see that margin have been contracting in the past two quarters for a couple of reasons. So with the sales recovery and margins recover (sic) [recovery] (62:06), so can you give us a guidance about the reasonable margin level of the search business? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I think for us, as you noted correctly, the business is recovering and rebuilding. The factors that we look at, many other factors have a lot of potential, specifically education, real estate, local services, like even retail continues to be very strong. I mentioned earlier also like the sectors like games, could be a lot of possibilities too. So as we look forward, search continues to have a lot of verticals that we can further develop and service our customers better, and with complementary feed products to service even bigger customer pools. I think for us to look at the overall business performance, it's our focus to run a highly efficient business. We have always steered our resources towards strategically important areas. As we identified AI as our key strategic focus, a lot of the effort is focusing on the R&D side, in particular, related to talent. So as I mentioned, if you look at the margin performance for the year, I have given a pretty clear indication in terms of how you look at our overall business. Basically this year, I think for us, we've talked about content that's related to iQiyi and our overall ecosystem build up. I talked about R&D that's related to talent, specifically for AI. And I think these are the main items and the rest of us is to focus on execution. No specific margin guidance, but I think I hope the information we provided is helpful for you to construct your margin picture. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. With regard to competitions, what I will emphasize is, first, we are clearly the market leaders, particularly in search market share on mobiles, and that's number one. Number two, our focus is on innovations, our focus on expanding the search scenarios, particularly expand search capability, so that search experience is fundamentally natural to a mobile device and tap into the rich capabilities such as camera and speech, so that over times we will be more compelling. And last, I will say is search at its core is a scaling business. There is a fundamental scaling impact. As market leaders, we want to fully leverage that, so that our technological capabilities with the new AI at the core will understand user better than any other, and understand content better than any others. So over time, we are confident that we will be able to maintain a strong market leadership position. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. So let me just add on the search revenue side. I think the search business has been a very traffic bound business. Advertisers or customers they all want to buy more traffic, and the performance is unmatched by any other type of media online or offline. So our focus has been and will continue to be on growing the search traffic, so we're not worried about other type of advertisement from other type of media. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ming Xu from UBS. Please go ahead. Ming Xu - UBS Securities (Asia) Ltd. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I have two questions. The first one is on the news feed side. So, if you name one key area to improve on the user experience of news feed, so I'm wondering whether it's – what is that, whether it's recommendation algorithm or targeting or content or something others. Could you help us understand. And secondly, my second question is on CPC. I think from 20-F, we know that last year, the number of paid clicks actually (66:45) more quickly than revenue growth indicating that the CPC is actually down. So you just mentioned that this year the paid clicks will continue to grow. So could you also comment on the CPC trend? Thanks. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first talk about the feed side, good question. If there is one thing for us to focus is the quality of the matching algorithms, because the search product fundamentally is about deeply understand a user, the user's interest, the information needs, on the other hand understand the content, but that's core is about matching them together. So the areas for us to focus on or the top priority areas is the quality of the matching algorithm, so that we can sustainably improve the overall user satisfaction and grow the base of that product. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And on your second question, yes, last year – if you recall, last year, we took effort to have a higher standard for our customers. And as a result, a lot of the customers are removed or unable to do business with us. For search, it is a bidding business model, when you have less like a smaller advertiser pool, the bidding will not be as intense. So that in itself can affect the CPC. However, looking at the paid click trend, you will notice that for this kind of phenomenon to occur, our advertisers are actually having better ROIs for the business. It continues to speak to this high performance nature of paid search and it's just a matter of transition now we're going through that CPC was a result of that, but that's not something that I feel should be worrisome. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Zhou - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd. Hi, Jennifer. Thank you for taking my questions. Just lastly, I wanted to ask an update about Baidu Financial Services, wondering whether this is actually becoming more of a visible or higher contribution portion within the other revenue being recognized in the first quarter, and how is the kind of profitability improvement within this segment for our business, because we have also seen some across industry, the overall growth, and profitability has improved a lot in the past few months. So I wonder if I can get an update on that. Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. For our Financial Services business, it does generate financing income, and that would flow through other revenue. It's still in its early stage, and having us building the fundamental capability like leveraging data and algorithm to have better modeling for credit risk underwriting would be the focus. So if you would see that we position our Financial Services business as a Fintech business, and we do originations and wealth management to help train our models, and so that we can really get better handling of the much richer data that we have and the technology capability. So Financial Services itself as effort is progressing very well, and I think it's on the path of getting more stronger fundamental capability in helping using the technology and a different angle to look at the Financial Services business.

The question-and-answer session of this conference call will start in a moment. Your first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Eddie Leung - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, good morning. First of all, my best wishes to Jennifer for your next role. And then for my questions, I'm wondering if you could share more color with us on the different components of your revenue guidance for the second quarter, especially any color on the contribution of our subscription and the newer business, mobile news feed will be helpful? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi, Eddie. Thank you for your kind words. With regards to Q2 revenue, as you look at our business, essentially it's the core business as well as iQiyi that are the main revenue contributors. Within the core business, there is search, we're also putting a lot of efforts in the feed. The feed product, as Qi mentioned earlier, from a user adoption perspective, it's progressing very well. We're in the early stage of monetizing the product. So we had not been very much focused on or driving aggressively on the monetization front. So for our core business, it continues to be very search centric, and we are very excited to expand the service we can offer to our users and advertisers, and we expect a solid progress in that regard, and we should expect the search business to extend over the next few quarters. For the iQiyi business, as you would have seen from our 20-F, last year iQiyi had a very solid growth and the contribution to our overall business. iQiyi is integral part of the overall Baidu ecosystem, and they continue to deliver very strong top-line growth driven by the business model of the subscription user base. So if you look at Q2, sequentially, you continue – Q1, sequentially you continue to observe other revenue line continues to grow quarter-on-quarter, and a big part of that is iQiyi's a subscription user business. So iQiyi's revenue growth is on solid ground, the two engine advertising as well as subscription fees continue to grow very well. So we're still on the path of recovery from last year's incident, and search is ramping up very nicely. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang from HSBC. Please go ahead. Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Good morning, everybody, and again congratulations, Jennifer, on this next opportunity. I wanted to ask you about core search. In particular, I was wondering if you can touch on traffic as well as demand. On the traffic front, what are you guys seeing in terms of growth in traffic and maybe growth in paid clicks year-to-date? And I'm wondering, if you expect paid clicks to grow faster this year than last year? And then, in terms of demand, given the rebasing of your customer base, as well as with higher standards, what type of customer growth do you expect this year? Thanks so much. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I'm going to take the first cut on Chi's question, and Qi and Robin can feel free to add. The traffic as overall continues to be very solid, mobile continues to be growing nicely, and a bigger proportion of the overall traffic. As you know, I mentioned earlier, the feed product is also we're busy developing that and seeing good progress on that. So from our product service perspective, we have the nicer search traffic as well as user engagement, that user has more time and interesting topics that they can view on the Baidu platform. For us to build in more of these inventories, it create more of the user products, it provides a bigger advertising pool and inventory for our advertisers. So I think going into 2017, later in the quarter, we should continue to expect that the paid clicks will power the growth of monetization. From a – the other question? Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Customers, yeah. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Customer, customer wise also, I think seasonally Q1 was a low quarter, and I think for the remainder of the year, as we have richer product for our advertisers and our sales force, refocus their efforts to develop the market, we should expect the customer base to grow as well. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me just add to what Jennifer described. With regard to search traffic, as we mentioned earlier, we view search as a fundamental human need, user need, and as we digitize more and more information, digitize more and more daily activities, the search overall demand will increase, that's number one. Number two, in current forms user express their intent through keywords, query input, landing on a set of information that will see its natural pace of growth as you have seen – our industry in China has been expanding so far. However, what I'll emphasize there is through AI technology innovations, we believe we can over time expand our search traffic by additional user experiences, for example you can search based on voice, you can search based on image, and more and more content will be available for search. So our focus is tapping into the current trend of user traffic growth for sure. At the same time, focusing on building better experience, more search capabilities, expanding into more search scenarios over time to expand search traffic. On the click, paid click side, again the pattern will be similar. The focus would be using AI technologies to understand the user intent better, and enable that to expose to advertisers, to our business customers, so that advertisers will have over time richer opportunities to place their campaigns as part of product, so that we have more opportunities to tap into the ongoing growing demand of advertising needs. So netted out, there's existing forms that's growing at its current pace and we're also focusing on tapping into future user traffic and future paid click growth opportunities through AI, through technological based enablement. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Alicia Yap - Citigroup Hi. Thank you. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer and Dr. Lu. Thanks for taking my questions. My questions is related to margins, so your comments of the operating margin including Baidu Core versus the Transaction Service, where Transaction Service 16.8% point reduction, does that mean in Q1, the margin on the Transaction Service only include the Baidu Takeout Delivery and the Map, but the Nuomi expenses is now part of the Baidu Core. And then how should we be thinking about the overall core margins in the future with news feed becoming a more meaningful part of the contributions? And then related to that, I wanted to ask about the content costs on the iQiyi front, is all the RMB 2.6 billion in Q1 is all related to iQiyi? Is there anything on that is related to the news feed content? And then with iQiyi recent licensing deal with Netflix, does the content cost guidance of doubling year-over-year this year still hold true, or should we expect even more than double in the content costs? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Alicia. So a few questions. First of all, the margin drag that we reported on Transaction Services was reported on the same concept and definition, consistent with the prior quarters. This is to give you an idea, and you can clearly see that we're reducing the investments on this front and we're shifting from mobile to AI. And so for your specific comment, Nuomi was included in this number and included in the Transaction Services, as a reminder, also has Financial Services, Baidu Delivery, Map and Nuomi, and so these are the main components. As I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to reduce spend on Nuomi and the other elements within the old transaction services sector has to do with core search or AI related initiatives. So, it doesn't really make sense for Transaction Service to stand as a separate sector, but for your information it's more to giving you an indication for this quarter that we are reducing spend on this front. For news feed, as mentioned before, news feed carries a different margin profile, and we're in the early stage of developing its business model from an advertising perspective. Currently, we're focusing on driving the user experience, user adoption, so investment related to feed has to do with the ecosystem buildup, content acquisition, R&D efforts, and some you can say infrastructure related, bandwidth and depreciation related to servers, because we're building the user traffic on the front. We haven't really focused on the advertising effort, but as Qi mentioned earlier, the business model is pretty apparent and the customers are quite open and acceptive to this advertising model. So, over time, we will ramp up the advertising and monetization capability. But at this point, it's very early stage. With regards to the content cost for Q1, yes, predominantly a biggest of majority of the Q1 content expense was iQiyi related. And as we mentioned earlier, our expectation is this year there will be a very important content investment mainly for iQiyi and also partly related to our feed product. The overall guidance we provided earlier that the content cost will likely go up the same percentage as before that estimate is still hold. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Alan Hellawell - Deutsche Bank AG (Hong Kong) Great. I just wanted to join the chorus in thanking Jennifer for setting a high watermark in the industry as a CFO, and also wish her the very best in her new role. A question around the interplay between demand for our search and news feed products. I can see key accounts scratching up new incremental budget to buy news feed ad, but I wonder if it is more cannibalistic to our budget limited SMEs that generally prefer the more focused sales generation aspects of buying a keyword to the more impression based aspect of news feed ad. And then just a quickie, a disclosure-related question. By folding in Transaction Services to Core search, are we no longer going to segregate out margin drag from Transaction Services and maybe even iQiyi? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first answer the first part of the question about on the demand side. The evidence so far has been showing a overall healthy growth and a specific evidence, I'll call out, is that, we have enabled our customers to place their campaign and budget in two ways. One is through their search campaign, they can indicate how much to go to the feeds, and there is also a separate interface that they can explicitly say, these budget will be on the feed side. There's a clear upward trend, a very rapid growth for customers, explicitly placing more campaign budget on the feed side, while maintaining their search campaign, search budget, and that's a clear signs of healthy growth, overall growth for our advertising needs for combined search and the feed products, number one. Number two, over time, we'll become more apparent that feed in many ways enable brand advertising to have a meaningful play at platforms. This is again very early. We're more focused on getting user experience to be truly, truly compelling and grow our user base and time spent. But from campaign demand perspective, our combined search and feed will enable more overall growth, not just from the traditional performance-based advertising into brand awareness based advertising as well. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And Alan, to your second question, yes, we're folding Transaction Services into Core, however, we will continue to separately identify iQiyi as a separate segment and report separately its margin impact on a quarterly basis. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Alex Yao - JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the Apollo project you guys announced recently. Does that make your autonomous car research project, open source type of the project, which will potentially impact your monetization capability. If it's not, can you help us understand your future project for monetizing the autonomous car driving initiative? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. That's a terrific question. As a matter of fact, I can tell you, my goal for project Apollo is to expand our monetization opportunities ahead, a real plausible path towards future economic value creation for Baidu. Specifically, let me give you the thumbnail of what Apollo is and comment on the business opportunities. First of all, as I described, it's open and compete in the reliable platforms. So we're open code, we're open software and then we're also open capabilities that through APIs. And we're also providing core services as the overall part of the platforms. The overarching design is any players in the auto industry with Apollo, you can put together the complete vehicle using off the shelf hardware components, and be able to run with different intelligent driving scenarios, and all the way up until 2020, towards fully autonomous driving. So that's the overarching vision by design. It's open innovation ecosystem. The key here is design point of that ecosystem, because the epic innovation center for the auto industry will be in data, in algorithms, in rapid pace of innovations towards intelligent driving. And Apollo is designed in that way, and I can tell you my personal experience, the Hadoop ecosystem, the core base come from my Yahoo! teams. And I personally witnessed through if you picked the right design point for the industry, you can tap into the vast growth and emphasize vast growth a win-win with all partners, and yet at the same times enable Baidu to tap into the economic opportunities. Now without going into the specifics, what I can point to you is, there is known ways of monetizing open networks, whether it's services, packaged softwares, components, solutions, all these options are available to Baidu to tap into. That's number one. Number two, the response from auto partners from industries has been, I could say, overwhelmingly positive, and our confidence of our ability to tap into the new rapid growth through the Apollo ecosystem and our ability to monetize is increased substantially, going forward. So it's a terrific question. Baidu not only want to enable a healthy ecosystem, but let's all make money in our way and grow the whole pie together. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Juan Lin from 86Research. Please go ahead. Juan Lin - 86Research Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Lu, and congratulations Jennifer on the new role. I have a question on the mobile gaming business. You mentioned that revenue contribution of mobile gaming business is around 3% of total revenue. I'm wondering what is the contribution to our profit. And after disconnecting this business, are you going to monetize the mobile game related traffic, which was previously directed to the mobile gaming business? Do you think that disconnecting business will eventually lead to a more efficient usage of your traffic in terms of monetization? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi. Mobile game, yes, as I said earlier, it contributed close to 3% of revenue last year. The game business operate, as you can see, is relatively small in our overall picture, and it doesn't generate the kind of margin as we do from our main business. So this transaction is actually a very good transaction for both us and the parties involved, and also it brings some good level of gains for us. For us, mobile game sector is always a very attractive sector for advertising business. And we do expect that even in the past, with mobile game operations, we have game advertising income and going forward, we will continue to develop this market and grow the mobile game advertiser base. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please go ahead. Natalie Wu - CICC Hi. Good morning, management. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, I want to extend my best regards to Jennifer on her new role. And my question is regarding the margin of the Core business excluding Transaction Service and iQiyi, which seems to be declined quite a lot in the first quarter despite savings from traffic acquisition costs. So just wondering is it mainly due to the AI-related investment, or is there any other factors behind that? And how should we look at the trend going forward? And also just a little bit clarification on the mobile game, so that the consolidation of mobile game business will be since mid-May, right, so that is to say your current guidance is reflecting half quarter's consolidation of the game-related revenue? Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. Yes, for Q1, I think a couple of factors to think about as you look at the margins for Core. Mainly for Core, a couple of things are going about. One is, we're still recovering from, for our search service from the last year's incident. It has not been fully recovered. We're on the good path, it's ramping up, it's performing as expected. The other thing is the investment related to feed. As I mentioned earlier, early stage in terms of monetization, but we are very focused on building feed as a very solid and good complementary product to our search service. Related to that, our bandwidth, depreciation, R&D, content cost and also channel distribution investment to help mobile Baidu be more prominent among the user base. So that's the other factor going in Q1. And the third element, as you mentioned, AI investment, you have seen R&D expense increased year-on-year. As I mentioned earlier, the incremental spend would all be related to AI initiatives. AI initiatives are an integral part of our core service. It build upon the core technology capabilities and infrastructure capabilities. So that's what's driving the Q1's margin performance. For your second question with regards to mobile games, yes, you are correct. So basically, as I mentioned earlier, mobile game contributed to Q1 overall financial performance, it will only have about half of that in the Q2 period. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. So, Jennifer, what I would just add to emphasize the AI investment part, the placeholder (53:03) I would like to emphasize is, we will be very disciplined and systematically optimize our resource allocations to make sure that our engineering investments and R&D investment is truly tap into the substantial growth opportunities ahead of us. And we're going through lot of work across different teams to make sure that our resource allocation utilization is fully optimized towards two fundamental focus. One is elevating our current core business, we see a lot of growth opportunities ahead, and at the same time accelerating the commercialization of AI-enabled business. So, being disciplined and being very systemically in optimization is very important to us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Piyush Mubayi - Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC Thank you for taking my question. First, Jennifer, congratulations on your new role. We wish you the best in your future endeavors. My question is directed to Qi at this point. We recognized that Baidu is strongly positioned in AI R&D. As the business model evolves in the medium-term, could you give us a glimpse into the range of operating metrics that become relevant, so we can better understand and appreciate the new world we're getting into? And very specifically as we go into a face, voice, and image recognition based world that AI would bring about versus the current search monetization model in place, how do you think that's going to change? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Well, thank you. Thank you for the questions. So, let me first comment on your first question with regard to operating metrics. First, myself, my teams are very, very focused on accelerating the commercialization of our AI-enabled new businesses, and because the core of AI technology is about efficiently extract knowledge from data, and our focus is first of all establish very, very compelling user scenarios, and users and usage are important part of metrics. And the second is the data and iteration (sic) [integration] (55:26) rate, how we can iterate (sic) [integrate] (55:28) based on the data that we have in our systems. And the third is rapidly explore business models and monetization capabilities. And adding up together, we are developing our overall operating frameworks and operating dashboards, these are the type of things, Jennifer, myself, our teams collectively look at every week, every months, and we're focusing on driving a disciplined and accelerated pace of execution on commercializing the AI initiative, AI-enabled new business initiatives. As I mentioned in my prepared speech earlier, as we move forward when appropriate, we will shed more light with the investor communities about those operating metrics, because it would take time to evolve, but what I can show you is our teams are staying very, very focused to be very disciplined and rigorous in accelerating our pace forward. With regard to your question about modality change, on the consumer side, our current view is that will not fundamentally affect the economic patterns, because even if you use voice instead of using keyboards, you still express your intent, and once we understand user intent, and we understand the content that users try to seek to access, we will be able to place match that in a good way, and existing models of advertising or other forms will be equally applicable in that scenario. So, at this stage, we do not see a fundamental shift even though modality may change, the economic opportunity in front of us will be equally compelling as we have seen up to this point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Karen Chan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Karen Chan - Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. Thank you management for taking my question. Congratulations to Jennifer on your new role. My first question is related to Core margins. So it is negatively impacted partly by the initial ramp up of mobile news feed ad. So how should we think about normalized margin level once the mobile news feed app reach a certain scalability? And my second question is regarding our monetization timeline of DuerOS apps with the AI-enabled home device partnership we secured. Wondering if management can share any color on that? Thanks. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thanks, Karen. I'll take the first part and Qi can help address the second. As I mentioned earlier, currently the margin doesn't reflect a true picture. I think we mentioned earlier, feed is a product that's going to carry a different margin profile. But overall, I think just purely focusing on margins is just one angle. It's more important to think about the overall service and revenue opportunities that we can generate because of the product of search. The core search continues to be a very fundamental need, and that business model is beautiful and scalable and high margin. First for feed to complement the search service, we give our advertisers a much bigger advertising inventory, and the advertisers, big or small, can have more budget allocated with us. So for us to think about feed because it is a push kind of product, it's different from search. The overall it's a mix, it's a more beautiful and more integrated, and richer service that we provide, and I think it's important to look at the bigger market value we can potentially tap. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me comment on the second part of question with regard to DuerOS monetization and its timeline. And here is how we think about DuerOS, its position in the industry, and now we shed light on how we think about monetization. First of all, DuerOS is the AI generation user experience platform, very similar to iOS and Android. iOS, Android is really for fingers, the device sitting in everybody's pocket. DuerOS, the fundamental interaction is natural language and voice based and it's everywhere. It's on every device, in every scenario. So it's a platform in that regard. The second, DuerOS is also a new entry point, because as you use DuerOS more and more in your home, in your car, say, play the next song for me, order pizza that becomes a new entry. So it plays dual role as a experienced platform, a new form of entry. On the entry side, the monetization is very natural. This is very similar to today's information gateway, like search. And the timeline will be the amount of scale that we can grow into, and there will be natural opportunities we can tap into. The second is about the platforms. Traditionally, there are several dimension with platform economics. If you look at iOS and Android, there is ways to run a app store type models, you can get economical value. There is VIG for the applications that builds on top of the platforms, and at the same time DuerOS also strategically bring additional demand to our ABC cloud. So we can also indirectly monetize through that vehicles. So having said all of that, our focus right now is really grow the ecosystem. We're doing a good job. Our team is really racing ahead, every day, every week, we're signing up new partners. So our focus is on scale. But as I said, we see ourselves as a clear leader in China and the opportunities over time will be tremendous. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Grace Chen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Grace Chen - Morgan Stanley Taiwan Ltd. Hello. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. The question is about the search business. From the Q2 sales guidance, we can see that the search sales should be recovering on both QoQ and then year-over-year basis. Can you help us understand what are the key drivers for the sales recovery in terms of market segments? And also can you comment on the competitive landscape, in the advertising business in general, for example, from like social and e-commerce peers? And also on the margin for search business, as we've just discussed that, we can see that margin have been contracting in the past two quarters for a couple of reasons. So with the sales recovery and margins recover (sic) [recovery] (62:06), so can you give us a guidance about the reasonable margin level of the search business? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I think for us, as you noted correctly, the business is recovering and rebuilding. The factors that we look at, many other factors have a lot of potential, specifically education, real estate, local services, like even retail continues to be very strong. I mentioned earlier also like the sectors like games, could be a lot of possibilities too. So as we look forward, search continues to have a lot of verticals that we can further develop and service our customers better, and with complementary feed products to service even bigger customer pools. I think for us to look at the overall business performance, it's our focus to run a highly efficient business. We have always steered our resources towards strategically important areas. As we identified AI as our key strategic focus, a lot of the effort is focusing on the R&D side, in particular, related to talent. So as I mentioned, if you look at the margin performance for the year, I have given a pretty clear indication in terms of how you look at our overall business. Basically this year, I think for us, we've talked about content that's related to iQiyi and our overall ecosystem build up. I talked about R&D that's related to talent, specifically for AI. And I think these are the main items and the rest of us is to focus on execution. No specific margin guidance, but I think I hope the information we provided is helpful for you to construct your margin picture. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. With regard to competitions, what I will emphasize is, first, we are clearly the market leaders, particularly in search market share on mobiles, and that's number one. Number two, our focus is on innovations, our focus on expanding the search scenarios, particularly expand search capability, so that search experience is fundamentally natural to a mobile device and tap into the rich capabilities such as camera and speech, so that over times we will be more compelling. And last, I will say is search at its core is a scaling business. There is a fundamental scaling impact. As market leaders, we want to fully leverage that, so that our technological capabilities with the new AI at the core will understand user better than any other, and understand content better than any others. So over time, we are confident that we will be able to maintain a strong market leadership position. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. So let me just add on the search revenue side. I think the search business has been a very traffic bound business. Advertisers or customers they all want to buy more traffic, and the performance is unmatched by any other type of media online or offline. So our focus has been and will continue to be on growing the search traffic, so we're not worried about other type of advertisement from other type of media. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ming Xu from UBS. Please go ahead. Ming Xu - UBS Securities (Asia) Ltd. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I have two questions. The first one is on the news feed side. So, if you name one key area to improve on the user experience of news feed, so I'm wondering whether it's – what is that, whether it's recommendation algorithm or targeting or content or something others. Could you help us understand. And secondly, my second question is on CPC. I think from 20-F, we know that last year, the number of paid clicks actually (66:45) more quickly than revenue growth indicating that the CPC is actually down. So you just mentioned that this year the paid clicks will continue to grow. So could you also comment on the CPC trend? Thanks. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first talk about the feed side, good question. If there is one thing for us to focus is the quality of the matching algorithms, because the search product fundamentally is about deeply understand a user, the user's interest, the information needs, on the other hand understand the content, but that's core is about matching them together. So the areas for us to focus on or the top priority areas is the quality of the matching algorithm, so that we can sustainably improve the overall user satisfaction and grow the base of that product. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And on your second question, yes, last year – if you recall, last year, we took effort to have a higher standard for our customers. And as a result, a lot of the customers are removed or unable to do business with us. For search, it is a bidding business model, when you have less like a smaller advertiser pool, the bidding will not be as intense. So that in itself can affect the CPC. However, looking at the paid click trend, you will notice that for this kind of phenomenon to occur, our advertisers are actually having better ROIs for the business. It continues to speak to this high performance nature of paid search and it's just a matter of transition now we're going through that CPC was a result of that, but that's not something that I feel should be worrisome. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Zhou - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd. Hi, Jennifer. Thank you for taking my questions. Just lastly, I wanted to ask an update about Baidu Financial Services, wondering whether this is actually becoming more of a visible or higher contribution portion within the other revenue being recognized in the first quarter, and how is the kind of profitability improvement within this segment for our business, because we have also seen some across industry, the overall growth, and profitability has improved a lot in the past few months. So I wonder if I can get an update on that. Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. For our Financial Services business, it does generate financing income, and that would flow through other revenue. It's still in its early stage, and having us building the fundamental capability like leveraging data and algorithm to have better modeling for credit risk underwriting would be the focus. So if you would see that we position our Financial Services business as a Fintech business, and we do originations and wealth management to help train our models, and so that we can really get better handling of the much richer data that we have and the technology capability. So Financial Services itself as effort is progressing very well, and I think it's on the path of getting more stronger fundamental capability in helping using the technology and a different angle to look at the Financial Services business.

These forward-looking statements are made as of today based on certain expectations, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. I would also like to note that the company\'s use of non-GAAP financial measures is explained in today\'s earnings press release, and a full reconciliation between non-GAAP measures and the corresponding GAAP measures is provided in the tables accompanying the press release and at investors.bmc.com. At this time, I will turn the call over to Bob. Robert E. Beauchamp By now many of you have seen our third fiscal quarter results. While we had a record quarter for maintenance revenue, professional services revenue, total revenue and non-GAAP diluted EPS and saw many encouraging signs in our business, we did not meet our expectations for bookings, revenue or profitability. Most of our shortfall was a direct result of a number of large forecasted deals in our ESM business unit failing to close at the end of the quarter. In fact, we had a historically low proportion of large deals closed this quarter, as compared to the previous 15 quarters. We believe this resulted from a combination of difficult macroeconomic conditions, some specific uncertainty related to press coverage surrounding our strategic review and the ongoing press coverage related to activist -- investor activity, as well as our own execution issues. A number of large transactions that we have booked this year and are currently pursuing are transformational in nature, fundamentally changing our clients\' approaches to enterprise management and consolidation. And in the, process replacing a number of competitors products. We continue to hear from our customers, prospects, partners, industry analysts and others, that our strategy is the right one and that our solutions are superior to our competitors. Our strategy, our market, our position in those markets and our technological leadership continued to offer what we believe are significant opportunities for our company and our shareholders. And while the macroeconomic environment will continue to be tight, we expect our performance to improve in the fourth quarter and the upcoming fiscal year. Despite all this, the fact remains that we need to be more consistent and disciplined in how we execute and capture the opportunities we see in the addressable market. As we\'ve demonstrated in the past, we are committed to consistently growing bookings, revenue and earnings in order to increase shareholder value. Let me turn now to provide some additional insight in our business units, beginning with MSM. MSM continues to perform well overall, largely in line with our expectations with growth in both revenue and non-GAAP operating income. Third quarter MSM bookings were impacted by the timing of 2 large transactions that did not close during the period. Both of these transactions were with established customers we have contracts that are up for renewal in our fourth fiscal quarter. We now expect to close both transactions this quarter, as well as a number of other key renewals. It\'s shaping up to be a strong fourth quarter for MSM. We\'re very pleased to note that our Control-M product line is doing very well among our customers and currently represents approximately 40% of MSM\'s total booking, as measured on a trailing 12-month basis. In our top 15 MSM deals this quarter, we once again saw an increase in the spend rate, largely due to our success in selling more new products into those relationships. This is an indication of our solutions\' continuing importance to and relevance to some of our most strategic customers. During the quarter, we added or expanded our relationships with 209 new MSM product placements, a 31% increase over a year ago. We also won a number of key competitive replacements against our major competitors. New product placements in both new and existing customers during the quarter included Amica Insurance Company, Thomson Reuters, China Construction Bank and NTT DATA. Finally, we continue to maintain operating discipline with MSM with non-GAAP operating income increasing by 2% on a year-over-year basis. MSM non-GAAP operating margin is now 62%. Let me now turn to ESM. As I noted upfront, our ESM license bookings were well below our expectations, directly related to slippage of a number of large deals. I\'m happy to report, however, that we\'re off to a solid start in the fourth quarter and already closed several slip transactions, including a multimillion dollar license transaction. We are aggressively pursuing the other transactions that slipped and many of them are tracking well. We remain positive on the underlying trends we\'re seeing in the marketplace and in the progress we\'ve made in key metrics related to our sales force, including capacity, tenure and attrition rates. During the quarter we continued to grow our SaaS business, which is now approaching 550 active customers. Over double the number of active customers we saw a year ago. I am particularly pleased with the strong growth in our Remedyforce business, as our increased investment and strong partnership with salesforce.com is paying off. SaaS revenue more than doubled year-over-year, while our cloud business also continued to grow, with cloud licensed bookings up over 40% year-over-year. I\'m also pleased to report that Remedy On-Premise total bookings were up 10% in the quarter, which is the second straight quarter of year-over-year growth. During the quarter we won a number of ESM deals, including CARFAX, [indiscernible] Securities, DBS Bank, Deloitte and Pfizer. Additionally, after an extensive evaluation, one of the U.K.\'s largest retail banks chose BMC\'s Remedy 8.0 On-Premise solution, over both the incumbent, HP, and ServiceNow\'s managed service SaaS offering. Let me now turn to our professional services business. This business performed largely in line with expectations during the quarter, in terms of revenue and profitability. Revenues rose 16% on a year-over-year basis and non-GAAP gross margins improved substantially, growing by 9 percentage points year-over-year. The improvements we put in place in terms of process discipline, backlog scheduling and resource allocation are driving these stronger results. The healthy and growing professional service business directly supports the transformational projects we are involved with in our largest customers and it strengthens our competitive positioning. So that covers our business performance during the third quarter. We are committed to taking the actions that are required to improve our performance and to increase shareholder value. Toward that end, I\'ve asked Bill Miller, President of our MSM business, to oversee a company-wide operational review. Bill has done a great job of delivering consistent positive results with strong operational discipline for the past 6 years in his capacity as MSM BU leader. This initiative will improve our operational discipline in pursuing this strategy we\'ve set. BMC will move rapidly to sharpen our focus and improve our short-term execution, make the appropriate level of investment to grow our business and improve our operations and profitability. This review is currently underway and will position us well, as we enter fiscal year 2014. I\'ll discuss our updated outlook for fiscal 2013 in a few minutes. First, let me turn it over to Steve Solcher, for a detailed financial review. Stephen B. Solcher Thank you, Bob. As you\'ve heard, our third quarter results were below our expectation, mainly with the decline in bookings in both our MSM and ESM businesses. Our MSM business is inherently lumpy. Two large transactions mentioned earlier that were originally expected to close during the third quarter are now anticipated to close in the fourth quarter. As for the ESM business, we also experienced slip deals, particularly among larger transactions. We did, however, generate healthy growth in ESM maintenance revenues as well as an increase in the maintenance renewal rates during the quarter. We also saw solid increases in key ESM growth areas, such as cloud and SaaS, improved performance around the Remedy On-Premise product line and we\'re pleased with the performance of our professional services business. With that, let me review our financial results for the third quarter in more detail. Non-GAAP operating income in the quarter was $210 million, down 1% from the third quarter of last year. Our third quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 36%, down 3 percentage points from the year ago quarter. Please refer to Slide 5 in our presentation for selected non-GAAP financial information, which includes information on our ESM and MSM business units. ESM\'s non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter declined to $71 million, down 7% from the year ago quarter. ESM\'s non-GAAP operating margin decreased year-over-year by 3 percentage points to 20%. MSM\'s non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter was $140 million, up 2% from a year-ago quarter and MSM\'s non-GAAP operating margin decreased 1 percentage point to 62%. Our non-GAAP net earnings for the third quarter were $151 million, down 4% from the third quarter of fiscal 2012. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.99, up 6% year-over-year. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 25%. GAAP operating income in the third quarter was $148 million, a decrease of 9% from the third quarter of fiscal 2012. GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $106 million and $0.70, respectively. Our results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter of $153 million versus $170 million in the respective prior year quarter. Turning now to bookings. Total bookings for the third quarter were $514 million, a decrease of 2% compared to the year ago quarter, on both a reported and constant currency basis. Trailing 12-month bookings were $2.1 billion, down 6% as reported and down 5% in constant currency year-over-year. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.1 years, down 8% from the year ago period. This reduction in contract length is attributable to MSM\'s contract went returning to its historical average of approximately 3 years. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the third quarter were $993 million, up 2% from the year ago period. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation. Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. Total ESM license bookings were $116 million in the third quarter, down 8% from the year-ago quarter. As Bob mentioned earlier, cloud related license bookings were up 44% on a year-over-year basis. We also achieved solid growth in our SaaS business. Two key measures of our SaaS business, our monthly recurring revenue, our MRR, and SaaS subscription revenue. MRR represents the combined monthly value of subscription fees associated with our active customers. As of December 31, our SaaS MRR totaled 3 million, a 114% increase compared to the year-ago quarter. SaaS subscription revenue for the third quarter was $7 million, which grew 166% over the year-ago quarter. SaaS subscription revenue is reflected within maintenance revenue in our income statement. Turning to the MSM business unit. Trailing 12-month total MSM bookings decreased 17% to $769 million and had an average contract length of 3 years, down 5% compared to the year-ago period. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $253 million, down 13%. Moving on to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was a record $580 million, up 6%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2012, on both a reported and constant currency basis. ESM total revenue was $355 million, up 7% compared to the year-ago quarter, and MSM total revenue for the quarter was up 4% to $225 million. License revenue in the third quarter was $232 million, up 3% from a year ago. ESM license revenue was $131 million, down 2%, while MSM license revenue was $101 million, up 11% from last year. For the third quarter, maintenance revenue was a record $289 million, an increase of 6% compared to the year-ago quarter and up 1% sequentially. ESM maintenance revenue was $165 million, up 11% and MSM maintenance revenue was $124 million, flat compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2012. This is the third straight quarter of 11% year-over-year growth in ESM maintenance revenue. Professional services revenue, which is included in our ESM business unit, grew 16% from the year ago quarter to a record $59 million. As Bob mentioned, we were pleased with professional services non-GAAP gross margins, which grew by 9 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Moving next to operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $370 million, up 10% from the year-ago quarter. Looking in our business units, ESM\'s non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $284 million, up 11% from the year-ago quarter and MSM non-GAAP operating expenses were $86 million, up 8% from the year-ago quarter. Other income in the third quarter was a loss of $11 million compared with a loss of $4 million in the year-ago quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the third quarter was $622 million, down 1% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. During the quarter, we deferred $95 million of license revenue, or 42% of licensed bookings, and recorded $98 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Total deferred revenue decreased by $66 million sequentially to $1.8 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 55%. Our software development cost as of December 31 were $268 million, as we capitalized $34 million and amortized $29 million during the quarter. Cash and investments totaled $1.3 billion, with 23% of our cash held domestically. And at December 31, we were in a net debt position of $79 million. In November of this year, we issued $300 million of senior unsecured notes with a 10-year maturity. In the same month, we also entered into $200 million unsecured term loan agreement with an institutional lender. The term loan has a 3-year maturity. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $132 million. During the third quarter, we repurchased a total of 14.3 million shares. As part of the accelerated share repurchase agreement we announced in November, we received 13.1 million shares, which is in addition to the 1.2 million shares we repurchased for $50 million earlier in the quarter. Our current outstanding share repurchase authorization is $700 million. With that, I\'ll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks and updated expectations for fiscal 2013. Robert E. Beauchamp Let me now provide you with our updated full year fiscal 2013 expectation for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. We expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share. At the midpoint, this would represent a 5% increase over fiscal 2012. This range excludes an estimated $1.13 to $1.18 per share for non-GAAP adjustments, including expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, severance, exit cost and related charges and proxy contest costs. We expect full-year fiscal 2013 cash flow from operations to be between $735 million and $785 million, which at the midpoint represents a 5% decrease over fiscal 2012, including the adverse impact from foreign currency exchange rates. I\'d like to highlight certain risk, which could impact our ability to achieve these expectations. Uncertainty surrounding the broader macroeconomic environment, especially in Europe. Sales productivity related to tenure of our ESM sales organization and uncertainty related to press coverage surrounding our strategic review and ongoing press coverage related to activist investor activity. The current assumptions underlying our full year fiscal 2013 expectations include: FX impact given today\'s rates; total bookings flat with the prior year, with growth on a constant currency basis of low single digits; ESM license bookings decline in the mid- to high-single digits and down low- to mid-single digits in constant currency; MSM total bookings decline in the low- to mid-single digits and flat to down low-single digits in constant currency; revenue growth in the low-single digits with growth on a constant currency basis in the low- to mid-single digits. Non-GAAP operating margin slightly lower than the prior year, other income at a loss of around $40 million, weighted shares outstanding down high-single digits to low-double digits from the prior year and a non-GAAP tax rate of 25%. As we look at the factors affecting our performance in our third quarter results, we recognize that we must deliver stronger financial performance and an operating plan that drives greater value for all our shareholders. On our next call with you, we will provide our fiscal 2014 expectations based on a strong operating plan. This plan will be focused on generating stronger operating margins, earnings growth and cash flow. With that, we will now turn the call over for your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] We\'ll go first to Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Obviously, the ESM license bookings was disappointing. I guess I wanted to dig into that a little bit more. I think you indicated that there were a few large transactions that slipped. Was that more -- I know at the top you mentioned it was a little bit environment, a little bit execution. But could you sort of give us a little bit more color on was that more environment, was it more execution, and perhaps which geos those deals were in? Robert E. Beauchamp Yes. So the geos were -- while it was a little more Europe I would say that it was across geographies and across verticals. It was really transactions that were transformational or optional. We did not really see slips in deals that had an expiration date, a contract renewal. These were really the deals where the customer say is swapping out competitors, standardizing on our platform for their new architecture. Those sort of larger deals where there\'s more -- for lack of a better term, risk to the customer, more ROI justification. And when it got to procurement, we saw them slow down for a couple of reasons. In some cases, it was a macro where their institution just said, "We\'re pulling back on discretionary, large transactions. Let\'s -- we don\'t have to do it this quarter. Let\'s wait." In a few cases, there was -- they inserted a cycle where they wanted to speak with me, or with Steve, or with some other executives, BMC around press coverage and our strategic review announcements and the press coverage surrounding that. So we saw both of those things kind of add an additional cycle in the close. But again it was transactions that were transformational, optional and not deals where we had, for instance, capacity-based upgrades and contract expirations. We saw a really nice compliance for the quarter on those type of deals. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division And so not as competitive then either? Is that fair to assume also? Robert E. Beauchamp Probably right. I\'d say it\'s not that it\'s not as competitive. The customer has a -- it was -- time was a backstop on contracts, on the deals where you have contract renewal, there\'s pressure on us and on the customer to reach an agreement by that deadline. Otherwise, the contract provisions kick in, licensing and passwords and all the things that can happen. The other one is more their own internal desire to lower their cost, improve their operations and a more discretionary sort of spending that were the ones that we saw slow down. But yes, I guess you could say more competitive. We were trying to replace competition in quite a few of them. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division And then in terms of the -- in terms of the full year guide, it\'s obviously a little different tone than last quarter, which I think you\'re expecting sequential and year-on-year growth in both the 3Q and 4Q periods. So I think at the midpoint of your full year ESM guide, it implies down kind of low-double digits for 4Q. Given the commentary on some deals that had already closed, or are still there, how conservative is that estimate versus prior expectations? Robert E. Beauchamp So one thing I\'d just start with is the number -- the percentage of transactions, are the quarter that -- excuse me, if I look at the dollar volume that we do in a quarter that are in transactions $1 million or above, we track that pretty closely. And it typically runs in the high 40s, approaching 50% of our bookings in any particular quarter are these large transactions. This quarter is the first time that I can remember and we went back, I think, 4 years and just looked at it. We\'ve not seen it drop below 40% and it did this quarter. So not only was it transactional, but we actually saw statistically a smaller percentage of our bookings on large transactions. We\'re assuming in the guidance that, that actually worsens and that we go to really an unprecedented, or certainly many, many, many years level of volume of large transactions just to be hope on the safe side, right? We\'re also assuming that the close rates that we saw in Q3 actually worsened in Q4 as we give this guidance. And so we\'ve got a significantly more upside as it relates to the forecast than we had in Q3. We\'ve got more buffers built into it. But given what happened in Q3, I don\'t know if I\'m being conservative. But we think we\'re being conservative by applying these numbers that we\'ve not ever applied before. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division And then if I can just squeeze in one last one. I know you didn\'t talk about fiscal \'14 guidance at this point, but really given, at least from a guidance perspective, 2 straight down years on the ESM side. Should we -- is it safe to assume that we should assume some growth in \'14 on the ESM side? Or is that maybe... Robert E. Beauchamp Yes, it\'s safe to assume we should assume growth. We should assume a company that is more focused on operating income, cash flow and margins. Operator We\'ll go next to Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division Just a follow-up on the comments you made about some more upside potential relative to your guidance. Can you just talk about how that then flows through on the expense side? Does that put sort of more people in an incentive phase? And what I\'m getting to, it does look like the earnings would be lower on a sequential basis to what you just reported despite the ASR, the big buyback in the quarter. I\'m just trying to reconcile so why the earnings would be down on a much lower share count. Robert E. Beauchamp Is that a Q4 statement, Aaron, that you\'re... Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division Yes. Robert E. Beauchamp I think it really is, is we\'re being conservative on the revenue side. And then you got to take the sequential seasonal pattern where expenses actually grow in Q4. It is all of the variable compensation is heavily back-end loaded and you\'ll see that in the half as well as Q4. You\'ve got all the resets from calendar, payroll taxes, 401k and the like. It is not atypical for us to see a seasonal swing in Q4 for just our normal non-GAAP expense structure. Stephen B. Solcher And then our sales comp plans are back-end loaded. Robert E. Beauchamp Right. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division Right. So, I guess, what I was asking, because the expenses are pretty in line with our model despite the lower bookings number. So I would\'ve assumed variable comp would\'ve been lower, but it didn\'t seem like it was. So I just don\'t know if sort of the recut of the guidance here puts maybe more sales folks in sort of an accelerator phase and that\'s what\'s sort of making them back-end loaded expense structure. Robert E. Beauchamp Well, not really. We\'re being conservative in the way that we\'re modeling out revenue going forward. So the deferral rate is slightly higher in Q4 than in Q3. Even though you\'re going to see a sequential increase in ESM license bookings, our expectation right now in the guidance is that we also are factoring in a higher deferral rate. So I believe what you\'re seeing is, is the upside that Bob talks about comes in we\'re going to do better at the op margin level. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division Okay. And then you\'ve mentioned, and I\'m sure you don\'t have all the answers yet, given the review. It sounds like it\'s just starting. But you\'ve talked about, sort of a few times here, the operational discipline into next year and a much more -- a focus on the earnings growth and the operating margin growth. Is there any sort of -- can you elaborate on that a little more? Is this sort of a shift in focus as you look at the growth reinvestment balance a little bit? Or are we getting ahead of ourselves in making that comment? Robert E. Beauchamp I\'d say that we\'re not going to -- as we said in the introductory comments, we think our SaaS business, our cloud business, our mobility, MyIT consumerization business, our Control-M business, our growth engines that we talked about last quarter continue to do well and we need to feed them even more. I think that we -- there\'s other parts of our business that are not delivering the ROI they need to deliver, and we\'re going to find ways to move funds to these growth engines at an even faster pace. So truly accelerating some of the things we talked about last quarter. There\'s no wholesale change in our strategy. It\'s just moving faster and it\'s also being a little more pragmatic about the need to deliver operating income, cash flow and margin given these top line numbers. So this management team, if you go back in time, has been very effective at delivering on cash flow, op income and margin expansion when it\'s focused on it. And we\'re very focused on that next year so that we can deliver the results we need and the growth we need next year. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division And I know you\'re not sort of quantifying anything, but the way you talk about the margins here, we assume that cash flow sort of follows that same directional flow? Robert E. Beauchamp Yes. Operator And Abhey Lamba, with Mizuho Securities, has our next question. Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division So Bob, amongst the reasons you mentioned shareholder activism as one of the key reasons behind the dynamics in the quarter. Now that issue we thought was kind of put to rest earlier on in the quarter, but it seems like it\'s still coming up in client conversations. Can you tell us a little bit more about how big of a factor is that even currently even in Q4? And how long will it continue to be a factor in your sales conversations? Robert E. Beauchamp Sure. I don\'t know how long it will continue to be a factor. It will be as long as it\'s in the market. I think that what is different is the fact that while we and the investment community and the management talked about our strategic review and that, that was behind us. The competitors are using the strategic review, they\'re using the market collateral that was generated as a result of that. They are -- they\'re using that aggressively against us, in our customer campaigns. Our head of MSM sales has been here a long time said that he believes on virtually every large competitive deal that he had, they had to address that this last quarter. In Europe, roughly 25% of the transactions that we did in Europe required on-site visits by management to talk to the customers about it. So while it\'s the case that, again, while the shareholders and the management team had stopped talking about it, the customers -- the analysts and the competitors have not. And in fact, we recently spoke with Gartner, Forrester and IDC, and I\'ll be talking to them, one of them, later after this call, today, who confirmed that they saw a large spike in customer inquiries surrounding this in their consultations. So it\'s just something we have to deal with and I believe that just time will eventually take it out of the equation. We\'re assuming it stays in our business, as we gave guidance for Q4 that it\'s not going to go away in Q4. Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division Sounds good. And lastly, as part of that -- a follow-up to that, has that resulted in any places where BMC has lost a dealer, or lost your customer, a large one? And secondly, as part of the same competitive conversation, if you can touch upon the OnDemand offerings, basically, your growth rates are good, but they are coming off of a small base. So any kind of shift in the competitive landscape over there? Are you winning more deals versus competition, your win rates versus others? Anything on that. Robert E. Beauchamp So there are 2 questions there. The first one was, yes, we did. And one of our largest transactions, the ESM largest transaction that was in the forecast, was a Fortune 50 company in New York. We were advised we had won all the technical evaluation. They had senior management had shaken hands and then they went silent and then we lost. And we were advised that we lost the business to the incumbent, a larger company than us. And the -- when they ultimately reached back and talked to one of our -- one of my direct reports. What they said was that the decision against us was made for corporate reasons and it was related to the activity around our company. So that\'s the only big loss that we really had. It was a multimillion dollar loss. We did have another customer that was a 7-figure deal that we were working who advised us that they were taking us off the approved vendor list, basically, for now, until they felt comfortable with that subject. So those are 2 examples. And as I mentioned before, there were many, many examples where we had to deal with it. But you asked the question specifically on lost transactions. Only one of the large deals was lost directly, we believe, because of that. On the OnDemand business, we\'re doing very well against ServiceNow specifically, although not as good as we -- I want to do and not as good as we\'re going to do. But Remedy OnDemand, Remedyforce, is growing very nicely. As we mentioned, 550 customers, double the count. Our win rates are very strong, our growth rates are strong. We\'re winning in larger deals, as well as smaller deals, nice 6-figure deals. And one of the deals I mentioned on the call was at a U.K. bank where HP was the incumbent. Some months ago, many months ago, ServiceNow had been verbally awarded the business and told that it was theirs. And then they called us a few months ago and told us they wanted to move off of that and go back to our -- and go and sit with the Remedy 8.0 On-Premise. So that was a nice win. So we\'re winning against them on -- by our OnDemand, but we\'re also winning with our On-Prem. And we\'re also winning because we can go back and forth between the 2 and systems integrators and outsourcers can use an On-Prem model and a SaaS model with their various customers and integrate between the 2. So we still have a way to go. We still have a lot of work ahead of us there. But the trends are really looking nice against our competitors there. Operator We\'ll go now to Yun Kim with Janney Capital Markets. Yun S. Kim - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division Can you just explain just the overall business trends around these large transformation deals, which seems to be the source of weakness in the quarter? Has the pipeline for such deals been increasing over the past few quarters? And I\'m just trying to understand the recent trends around these large transformation deals and your reliance on them. Robert E. Beauchamp Well, as I said before, we\'ve had a fairly consistent percentage of our business has been from the 7-figure and 8-figure transactions for many years now. It\'s usually mid-40s to very high-40s, close to 50% of our volume, our deals of that size. And this quarter was the anomaly. They dropped below 40%, which we\'ve not seen in a very long time, if we\'ve seen it, in recent -- in a decade. And we -- and so, yes, the trend is we will continue to have large transactions. We will continue to -- it will continue to be in a very important part of our business. But as we guided to Q4, we\'re going to assume lower close rates, we\'re going to assume that something that they will continue to be more difficult to close. And that\'s -- part of our guidance, we\'ve assumed actually even lower than we had -- Q4 guidance is actually lower than Q3 as a both close rate and large deal volume as a percentage. Yun S. Kim - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division Okay, great. And then just shifting gears a little bit to more strategic areas within the ESM, can you give us some details around your Remedy OnDemand business, which is -- how much of a percentage of customers are new versus existing On-Premise customers? And maybe any major future product release that we can expect out of Remedy OnDemand? Stephen B. Solcher We don\'t have the breakout of Remedy OnDemand. Let me just give you the SaaS numbers in the aggregate. So cumulatively 80% of the customers that are the 550 that Bob talked about are new and 20% are existing. Of the existing customers, when they do convert, they are converting at about 130% of the existing run rate. So a little north of double what we were getting out of just, I would say, their ongoing run rate when we do get the converted customer. Yun S. Kim - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division And then also, any metric you can share with us on the Cloud Lifecycle Management performance in the quarter? I\'m not sure of your comments around cloud business was referring to the CLM product. Robert E. Beauchamp CLM year-to-date is up close to 40%. Cloud was up 44% in the quarter. It\'s up 32% year-to-year to date. That\'s cloud and all the related pieces. And CLM is somewhere, year-to-date, about 1/3 of the cloud-related bookings. Operator We\'ll go next to Derrick Wood, with Susquehanna Financial Group. James Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division So you had strong growth on the cloud booking side, on the Remedy On-Premise side, could you just share kind of some of the product areas that are seeing the greater weakness? Robert E. Beauchamp Yes. The proactive operations, the systems management business, red lights and green lights kind of out the patrol, to those that have been following us a long time. That business is still the biggest worry spot for us in terms of a particular product set. We\'ve got more competition with a broader spectrum. There are some people that are giving very, very low end, light touch, low functionality, but very inexpensive products. We have other competitors with science labs, sort of a deep functionality, very expensive products. So there\'s a really, almost -- that market is almost over served with capability. The companies\' like Cisco and Red Hat and others, they will come out with -- are coming out with monitoring, event management sort of products. So it\'s a crowded competitive field and it\'s also just not as much -- is not as sexy and is fun to sell as some of these other products. And so it continues to be the weakest product line for us. That was the main -- that\'s the main one that would... James Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division Any way to gauge the kind percentage of revenue, a percentage of your business on the ESM side coming from this part of the business? Robert E. Beauchamp Yes. Stephen B. Solcher It was 35% from a revenue base. It\'s probably somewhere in the mid 30\'s. One thing I mentioned to you, that statement I just said would have been true probably generally true at any kind of volume levels, but obviously when you have the license bookings, shortfall and large transactions all products kind of move up and down that are part of renewals, or part of -- are these larger transactions, rather, and so it can create anomalies. But I think that what I just talked about is not an anomaly, it\'s a longer-term issue. James Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division Okay. And then I\'m hoping you can just update us on the sales side and I guess if the press release and stuff that\'s happened around Elliott and the review,  I mean, has that impacted sales turnover last quarter you talked about pretty healthy growth increases in gross capacity and productive capacity. Can you just kind of update us on how that\'s trending, how you\'ve seen things over the last few months? Robert E. Beauchamp Yes. So capacity is up 23% for the year. So we\'re in good shape on capacity. Attrition went up a little in October, which you expect. But it came back down pretty sharply. And by December it was really fine so for the -- we\'re okay on that. But total capacity is good, continue -- tenure continues to improve. We\'ve not lost any kind of key sales leadership, sales management that I can think of. And we talked about that today. We had Carv on the phone talking about it. So we\'re in pretty good shape on that. The issue was we didn\'t see productivity improve and that is -- that\'s an area that we need to see improvement. So we\'ve got to focus on that. That\'s the area when I talk about execution that we need to see continuing that to improve. We expected to see it, and we didn\'t see it. So we\'ll continue to track that. James Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division If I could squeeze in one more, Bob. You mentioned that execution is expected to improve in Q4, but you guys are talking about weaker large deal percentage and weaker close rates. So how do I reconcile? Is that more on the margin side? Or how do I reconcile those 2 comments? Robert E. Beauchamp Well, I\'m not sure what I\'m reconciling. What I\'m saying is we hope -- we drive everyday, we\'re managing to run our business better. We are, as we give guidance, we\'re not assuming that it will. Until it does, we\'re not going to guide that it does. You follow me? We will guide once we have a trend of it\'s improving, we will guide up. Until it does, we\'re going to actually guide more conservatively than we had last quarter. We\'re not assuming any worsening of productivity in Q4 for our sales force. But we\'re going to try to be more conservative on close rates, pipeline close, all of our top-down and bottoms-up forecasting techniques. Operator Moving on to Kirk Materne, with Evercore Partners. Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division It\'s actually Matt Williams in for Kirk. Just 2 quick questions, if I might. Could you talk a little bit about some of the reasons behind the improvement in the On-Premise Remedy product line? Robert E. Beauchamp Yes. The first answer is Remedy 8.0 is an outstanding product. I continue to see some solid reports back on wins. Customers love the functionality. Remember, it\'s a -- going forward, it\'s a SaaS first model. So the functionality that we add on Remedy will be delivered in SaaS and then moved over to 8. So it\'s really designed from the beginning to be a flexible platform for our customers to go from SaaS to On-Prem. It\'s been very much modernized on its user interface on the ease of implementation, the time to implement. I think I mentioned before that we\'ve received notes on how -- and seeing customer comments on how easy and fast it is to implement. So it\'s just a really good solid product. That\'s Part 1. Part 2 is that the -- I think some of the initial thought that all customers were going to move to SaaS is no longer the case. Customers are now, and as I mentioned, a large U.K. bank, these are -- the customers are doing whatever the best fit is. So if you are a company in, say, Department of Defense and you may very well want to go with an On-Prem model, highly secure. If your performance requirements are of a certain nature, you might want to do it On-Premise. So customers will pick On-Prem for certain capabilities and SaaS for others. And BMC\'s able to offer both of them to the customer. But the short answer is, Remedy 8.0 is a very solid product and much easier to install and implement. I would caveat it, that right now, that we\'ve got 1 quarter under our belt and I want to see probably 2 more quarters -- we\'ve had 2 quarters, excuse me, of On-Prem performing well on a total bookings basis. Let me get 2 more quarters under our belt before we declare victory on that. Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division Sounds good, fair enough. And then secondly, could you just talk a little bit about the MyIT product and how that\'s being received. And I know it\'s early there as well, but any sort of color on when that might actually start to have an impact on the ESM side? It would be helpful. Robert E. Beauchamp Sure, sure. So it won\'t ship until April. The -- so it won\'t have much -- it won\'t have, really -- no impact, really, on its own SKU until then. I think it’s already having an impact with customers who are trying to decide whether to go with our IT service management platform and they see the vision of how the MyIT is taking, basically making the help desk disappear. So you\'re not calling and calling someone on the phone and asking them to opening a trouble ticket. You\'re dealing with your IT service request the same way you deal in your personal life, doing online banking and various other things. So it\'s really changing the game. It\'s abstracting the engine in the back, whether it\'s Remedy 8.0, or Remedyforce, or Remedy OnDemand, or even competitive products. It abstracts those in the background and it brings the service desk -- so it\'s your own personal IT service desk that you carry with you as an employee of the company. And so I think we are winning deals for our other products because of the vision of MyIT. When we demo MyIT, it\'s as excited a group of customers as any product that I remember ever seeing demonstrations for. But I -- then I got to caution, we haven\'t sold one yet, right? The thing doesn\'t go on sale until April. And so I don\'t know what I don\'t know, and I\'m sure we\'ll find something that is -- that we\'re going to have to deal with. I just don\'t know what it is yet. But so far, early indications are MyIT is really, really kind of game changing way of thinking about how to do IT delivery. Operator We\'ll now go to James Wesman with Raymond James. James Wesman Steve, just a quick question for the model. Looking at new share repurchase expectations for fiscal \'14, what would you consider to be more reasonable, should we think of it in terms of fiscal \'12, where we saw a mid-single digit decrease year-over-year? Or something close to fiscal \'11, where there was a low single-digit decrease? Stephen B. Solcher Well, \'14, the biggest difference between \'13 and \'14 is, is you don\'t get the full effect of the ASR in fiscal year \'13. And it\'s strictly due to the timing of the waiting. So we took the ASR, went into effect November 23, and even though we took 13.1 million shares out at that point in time, there are still almost another 6 million shares that will not come out until the end of June. And that\'s the true up period of time. We have 7 months to take the buying pattern of the ASR to 750. So \'14, what you\'re going to see is really the impact of that full waiting and we\'re going to start, if you -- when you do read the Q, you\'re going to see that we\'re already at a shares outstanding count of 142 million. So from where we are today, we\'re starting January 1 with a share count -- outstanding shares of 142 million. I don\'t know if that helped or made it worse. Operator We\'ll go next to Phil Winslow with Crédit Suisse. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division This is for Siti Panigrahi for Phil Winslow. You mentioned the 2 large MSM deals slipped in Q3. So just wondering, maybe could you give some color about the reasons for the deals slippage? And also in general, what are you seeing in terms of pricing and competition in the mainframe business? Robert E. Beauchamp Yes. So a couple of things on -- to answer your first question. The 2 deals were contract renewal expirations in Q4, where the customer called and requested that we try to negotiate a deal in Q3, which is not uncommon at all. And in fact, I\'d say it\'s more common that a certain percentage of every quarter has that request. We worked with the customer on that. And in both cases, at the end of the quarter, they pushed and said, we\'ll do it in Q4 when we have to. So I don\'t have to, but when it\'s scheduled. And so we have good confidence in both of those transactions in Q4. And that\'s very normal for MSM. The second question was -- remind me again -- oh, pricing. Pricing is good. Let me give you an example. So IBM, on mainframe, IBM is shipping these specialty engines, and one of the advantages, our product, we\'re really focused on trying to add more functionality to our products so that we cannot be kind of in a commodity just to speed and feed, but actually offer capabilities that are not just faster but different than our competition. And one of the functions that we have as part of our mainframe cost optimization initiative is the ability to help customers move workload from the GPM engine to the specialty engine. So by moving that workload, we cut the customers bills that they have to pay back to IBM significantly. And in exchange for that, we like to charge a little more for that capability because we have that unique capability. So price points -- I mean, in general, pricing is always under pressure, it\'s always a competitive market. There\'s always a lot of customer pressure to work our prices and we will. But we feel good about how we\'ve been able to hold our prices up, our price points up, by adding the customer with more capabilities, and specialty engine\'s a good example of that. All right. Again, thank you, all, very much. We will be talking with you, I\'m sure, throughout the quarter. And please call if you\'d like to arrange more time. Thank you.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Operator [Operator Instructions] We\'ll go first to Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Obviously, the ESM license bookings was disappointing. I guess I wanted to dig into that a little bit more. I think you indicated that there were a few large transactions that slipped. Was that more -- I know at the top you mentioned it was a little bit environment, a little bit execution. But could you sort of give us a little bit more color on was that more environment, was it more execution, and perhaps which geos those deals were in? Robert E. Beauchamp Yes. So the geos were -- while it was a little more Europe I would say that it was across geographies and across verticals. It was really transactions that were transformational or optional. We did not really see slips in deals that had an expiration date, a contract renewal. These were really the deals where the customer say is swapping out competitors, standardizing on our platform for their new architecture. Those sort of larger deals where there\'s more -- for lack of a better term, risk to the customer, more ROI justification. And when it got to procurement, we saw them slow down for a couple of reasons. In some cases, it was a macro where their institution just said, "We\'re pulling back on discretionary, large transactions. Let\'s -- we don\'t have to do it this quarter. Let\'s wait." In a few cases, there was -- they inserted a cycle where they wanted to speak with me, or with Steve, or with some other executives, BMC around press coverage and our strategic review announcements and the press coverage surrounding that. So we saw both of those things kind of add an additional cycle in the close. But again it was transactions that were transformational, optional and not deals where we had, for instance, capacity-based upgrades and contract expirations. We saw a really nice compliance for the quarter on those type of deals. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division And so not as competitive then either? Is that fair to assume also? Robert E. Beauchamp Probably right. I\'d say it\'s not that it\'s not as competitive. The customer has a -- it was -- time was a backstop on contracts, on the deals where you have contract renewal, there\'s pressure on us and on the customer to reach an agreement by that deadline. Otherwise, the contract provisions kick in, licensing and passwords and all the things that can happen. The other one is more their own internal desire to lower their cost, improve their operations and a more discretionary sort of spending that were the ones that we saw slow down. But yes, I guess you could say more competitive. We were trying to replace competition in quite a few of them. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division And then in terms of the -- in terms of the full year guide, it\'s obviously a little different tone than last quarter, which I think you\'re expecting sequential and year-on-year growth in both the 3Q and 4Q periods. So I think at the midpoint of your full year ESM guide, it implies down kind of low-double digits for 4Q. Given the commentary on some deals that had already closed, or are still there, how conservative is that estimate versus prior expectations? Robert E. Beauchamp So one thing I\'d just start with is the number -- the percentage of transactions, are the quarter that -- excuse me, if I look at the dollar volume that we do in a quarter that are in transactions $1 million or above, we track that pretty closely. And it typically runs in the high 40s, approaching 50% of our bookings in any particular quarter are these large transactions. This quarter is the first time that I can remember and we went back, I think, 4 years and just looked at it. We\'ve not seen it drop below 40% and it did this quarter. So not only was it transactional, but we actually saw statistically a smaller percentage of our bookings on large transactions. We\'re assuming in the guidance that, that actually worsens and that we go to really an unprecedented, or certainly many, many, many years level of volume of large transactions just to be hope on the safe side, right? We\'re also assuming that the close rates that we saw in Q3 actually worsened in Q4 as we give this guidance. And so we\'ve got a significantly more upside as it relates to the forecast than we had in Q3. We\'ve got more buffers built into it. But given what happened in Q3, I don\'t know if I\'m being conservative. But we think we\'re being conservative by applying these numbers that we\'ve not ever applied before. Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division And then if I can just squeeze in one last one. I know you didn\'t talk about fiscal \'14 guidance at this point, but really given, at least from a guidance perspective, 2 straight down years on the ESM side. Should we -- is it safe to assume that we should assume some growth in \'14 on the ESM side? Or is that maybe... Robert E. Beauchamp Yes, it\'s safe to assume we should assume growth. We should assume a company that is more focused on operating income, cash flow and margins. Operator We\'ll go next to Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division Just a follow-up on the comments you made about some more upside potential relative to your guidance. Can you just talk about how that then flows through on the expense side? Does that put sort of more people in an incentive phase? And what I\'m getting to, it does look like the earnings would be lower on a sequential basis to what you just reported despite the ASR, the big buyback in the quarter. I\'m just trying to reconcile so why the earnings would be down on a much lower share count. Robert E. Beauchamp Is that a Q4 statement, Aaron, that you\'re... Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division Yes. Robert E. Beauchamp I think it really is, is we\'re being conservative on the revenue side. And then you got to take the sequential seasonal pattern where expenses actually grow in Q4. It is all of the variable compensation is heavily back-end loaded and you\'ll see that in the half as well as Q4. You\'ve got all the resets from calendar, payroll taxes, 401k and the like. It is not atypical for us to see a seasonal swing in Q4 for just our normal non-GAAP expense structure. Stephen B. Solcher And then our sales comp plans are back-end loaded. Robert E. Beauchamp Right. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division Right. So, I guess, what I was asking, because the expenses are pretty in line with our model despite the lower bookings number. So I would\'ve assumed variable comp would\'ve been lower, but it didn\'t seem like it was. So I just don\'t know if sort of the recut of the guidance here puts maybe more sales folks in sort of an accelerator phase and that\'s what\'s sort of making them back-end loaded expense structure. Robert E. Beauchamp Well, not really. We\'re being conservative in the way that we\'re modeling out revenue going forward. So the deferral rate is slightly higher in Q4 than in Q3. Even though you\'re going to see a sequential increase in ESM license bookings, our expectation right now in the guidance is that we also are factoring in a higher deferral rate. So I believe what you\'re seeing is, is the upside that Bob talks about comes in we\'re going to do better at the op margin level. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division Okay. And then you\'ve mentioned, and I\'m sure you don\'t have all the answers yet, given the review. It sounds like it\'s just starting. But you\'ve talked about, sort of a few times here, the operational discipline into next year and a much more -- a focus on the earnings growth and the operating margin growth. Is there any sort of -- can you elaborate on that a little more? Is this sort of a shift in focus as you look at the growth reinvestment balance a little bit? Or are we getting ahead of ourselves in making that comment? Robert E. Beauchamp I\'d say that we\'re not going to -- as we said in the introductory comments, we think our SaaS business, our cloud business, our mobility, MyIT consumerization business, our Control-M business, our growth engines that we talked about last quarter continue to do well and we need to feed them even more. I think that we -- there\'s other parts of our business that are not delivering the ROI they need to deliver, and we\'re going to find ways to move funds to these growth engines at an even faster pace. So truly accelerating some of the things we talked about last quarter. There\'s no wholesale change in our strategy. It\'s just moving faster and it\'s also being a little more pragmatic about the need to deliver operating income, cash flow and margin given these top line numbers. So this management team, if you go back in time, has been very effective at delivering on cash flow, op income and margin expansion when it\'s focused on it. And we\'re very focused on that next year so that we can deliver the results we need and the growth we need next year. Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division And I know you\'re not sort of quantifying anything, but the way you talk about the margins here, we assume that cash flow sort of follows that same directional flow? Robert E. Beauchamp Yes. Operator And Abhey Lamba, with Mizuho Securities, has our next question. Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division So Bob, amongst the reasons you mentioned shareholder activism as one of the key reasons behind the dynamics in the quarter. Now that issue we thought was kind of put to rest earlier on in the quarter, but it seems like it\'s still coming up in client conversations. Can you tell us a little bit more about how big of a factor is that even currently even in Q4? And how long will it continue to be a factor in your sales conversations? Robert E. Beauchamp Sure. I don\'t know how long it will continue to be a factor. It will be as long as it\'s in the market. I think that what is different is the fact that while we and the investment community and the management talked about our strategic review and that, that was behind us. The competitors are using the strategic review, they\'re using the market collateral that was generated as a result of that. They are -- they\'re using that aggressively against us, in our customer campaigns. Our head of MSM sales has been here a long time said that he believes on virtually every large competitive deal that he had, they had to address that this last quarter. In Europe, roughly 25% of the transactions that we did in Europe required on-site visits by management to talk to the customers about it. So while it\'s the case that, again, while the shareholders and the management team had stopped talking about it, the customers -- the analysts and the competitors have not. And in fact, we recently spoke with Gartner, Forrester and IDC, and I\'ll be talking to them, one of them, later after this call, today, who confirmed that they saw a large spike in customer inquiries surrounding this in their consultations. So it\'s just something we have to deal with and I believe that just time will eventually take it out of the equation. We\'re assuming it stays in our business, as we gave guidance for Q4 that it\'s not going to go away in Q4. Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division Sounds good. And lastly, as part of that -- a follow-up to that, has that resulted in any places where BMC has lost a dealer, or lost your customer, a large one? And secondly, as part of the same competitive conversation, if you can touch upon the OnDemand offerings, basically, your growth rates are good, but they are coming off of a small base. So any kind of shift in the competitive landscape over there? Are you winning more deals versus competition, your win rates versus others? Anything on that. Robert E. Beauchamp So there are 2 questions there. The first one was, yes, we did. And one of our largest transactions, the ESM largest transaction that was in the forecast, was a Fortune 50 company in New York. We were advised we had won all the technical evaluation. They had senior management had shaken hands and then they went silent and then we lost. And we were advised that we lost the business to the incumbent, a larger company than us. And the -- when they ultimately reached back and talked to one of our -- one of my direct reports. What they said was that the decision against us was made for corporate reasons and it was related to the activity around our company. So that\'s the only big loss that we really had. It was a multimillion dollar loss. We did have another customer that was a 7-figure deal that we were working who advised us that they were taking us off the approved vendor list, basically, for now, until they felt comfortable with that subject. So those are 2 examples. And as I mentioned before, there were many, many examples where we had to deal with it. But you asked the question specifically on lost transactions. Only one of the large deals was lost directly, we believe, because of that. On the OnDemand business, we\'re doing very well against ServiceNow specifically, although not as good as we -- I want to do and not as good as we\'re going to do. But Remedy OnDemand, Remedyforce, is growing very nicely. As we mentioned, 550 customers, double the count. Our win rates are very strong, our growth rates are strong. We\'re winning in larger deals, as well as smaller deals, nice 6-figure deals. And one of the deals I mentioned on the call was at a U.K. bank where HP was the incumbent. Some months ago, many months ago, ServiceNow had been verbally awarded the business and told that it was theirs. And then they called us a few months ago and told us they wanted to move off of that and go back to our -- and go and sit with the Remedy 8.0 On-Premise. So that was a nice win. So we\'re winning against them on -- by our OnDemand, but we\'re also winning with our On-Prem. And we\'re also winning because we can go back and forth between the 2 and systems integrators and outsourcers can use an On-Prem model and a SaaS model with their various customers and integrate between the 2. So we still have a way to go. We still have a lot of work ahead of us there. But the trends are really looking nice against our competitors there. Operator We\'ll go now to Yun Kim with Janney Capital Markets. Yun S. Kim - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division Can you just explain just the overall business trends around these large transformation deals, which seems to be the source of weakness in the quarter? Has the pipeline for such deals been increasing over the past few quarters? And I\'m just trying to understand the recent trends around these large transformation deals and your reliance on them. Robert E. Beauchamp Well, as I said before, we\'ve had a fairly consistent percentage of our business has been from the 7-figure and 8-figure transactions for many years now. It\'s usually mid-40s to very high-40s, close to 50% of our volume, our deals of that size. And this quarter was the anomaly. They dropped below 40%, which we\'ve not seen in a very long time, if we\'ve seen it, in recent -- in a decade. And we -- and so, yes, the trend is we will continue to have large transactions. We will continue to -- it will continue to be in a very important part of our business. But as we guided to Q4, we\'re going to assume lower close rates, we\'re going to assume that something that they will continue to be more difficult to close. And that\'s -- part of our guidance, we\'ve assumed actually even lower than we had -- Q4 guidance is actually lower than Q3 as a both close rate and large deal volume as a percentage. Yun S. Kim - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division Okay, great. And then just shifting gears a little bit to more strategic areas within the ESM, can you give us some details around your Remedy OnDemand business, which is -- how much of a percentage of customers are new versus existing On-Premise customers? And maybe any major future product release that we can expect out of Remedy OnDemand? Stephen B. Solcher We don\'t have the breakout of Remedy OnDemand. Let me just give you the SaaS numbers in the aggregate. So cumulatively 80% of the customers that are the 550 that Bob talked about are new and 20% are existing. Of the existing customers, when they do convert, they are converting at about 130% of the existing run rate. So a little north of double what we were getting out of just, I would say, their ongoing run rate when we do get the converted customer. Yun S. Kim - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division And then also, any metric you can share with us on the Cloud Lifecycle Management performance in the quarter? I\'m not sure of your comments around cloud business was referring to the CLM product. Robert E. Beauchamp CLM year-to-date is up close to 40%. Cloud was up 44% in the quarter. It\'s up 32% year-to-year to date. That\'s cloud and all the related pieces. And CLM is somewhere, year-to-date, about 1/3 of the cloud-related bookings. Operator We\'ll go next to Derrick Wood, with Susquehanna Financial Group. James Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division So you had strong growth on the cloud booking side, on the Remedy On-Premise side, could you just share kind of some of the product areas that are seeing the greater weakness? Robert E. Beauchamp Yes. The proactive operations, the systems management business, red lights and green lights kind of out the patrol, to those that have been following us a long time. That business is still the biggest worry spot for us in terms of a particular product set. We\'ve got more competition with a broader spectrum. There are some people that are giving very, very low end, light touch, low functionality, but very inexpensive products. We have other competitors with science labs, sort of a deep functionality, very expensive products. So there\'s a really, almost -- that market is almost over served with capability. The companies\' like Cisco and Red Hat and others, they will come out with -- are coming out with monitoring, event management sort of products. So it\'s a crowded competitive field and it\'s also just not as much -- is not as sexy and is fun to sell as some of these other products. And so it continues to be the weakest product line for us. That was the main -- that\'s the main one that would... James Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division Any way to gauge the kind percentage of revenue, a percentage of your business on the ESM side coming from this part of the business? Robert E. Beauchamp Yes. Stephen B. Solcher It was 35% from a revenue base. It\'s probably somewhere in the mid 30\'s. One thing I mentioned to you, that statement I just said would have been true probably generally true at any kind of volume levels, but obviously when you have the license bookings, shortfall and large transactions all products kind of move up and down that are part of renewals, or part of -- are these larger transactions, rather, and so it can create anomalies. But I think that what I just talked about is not an anomaly, it\'s a longer-term issue. James Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division Okay. And then I\'m hoping you can just update us on the sales side and I guess if the press release and stuff that\'s happened around Elliott and the review,  I mean, has that impacted sales turnover last quarter you talked about pretty healthy growth increases in gross capacity and productive capacity. Can you just kind of update us on how that\'s trending, how you\'ve seen things over the last few months? Robert E. Beauchamp Yes. So capacity is up 23% for the year. So we\'re in good shape on capacity. Attrition went up a little in October, which you expect. But it came back down pretty sharply. And by December it was really fine so for the -- we\'re okay on that. But total capacity is good, continue -- tenure continues to improve. We\'ve not lost any kind of key sales leadership, sales management that I can think of. And we talked about that today. We had Carv on the phone talking about it. So we\'re in pretty good shape on that. The issue was we didn\'t see productivity improve and that is -- that\'s an area that we need to see improvement. So we\'ve got to focus on that. That\'s the area when I talk about execution that we need to see continuing that to improve. We expected to see it, and we didn\'t see it. So we\'ll continue to track that. James Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division If I could squeeze in one more, Bob. You mentioned that execution is expected to improve in Q4, but you guys are talking about weaker large deal percentage and weaker close rates. So how do I reconcile? Is that more on the margin side? Or how do I reconcile those 2 comments? Robert E. Beauchamp Well, I\'m not sure what I\'m reconciling. What I\'m saying is we hope -- we drive everyday, we\'re managing to run our business better. We are, as we give guidance, we\'re not assuming that it will. Until it does, we\'re not going to guide that it does. You follow me? We will guide once we have a trend of it\'s improving, we will guide up. Until it does, we\'re going to actually guide more conservatively than we had last quarter. We\'re not assuming any worsening of productivity in Q4 for our sales force. But we\'re going to try to be more conservative on close rates, pipeline close, all of our top-down and bottoms-up forecasting techniques. Operator Moving on to Kirk Materne, with Evercore Partners. Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division It\'s actually Matt Williams in for Kirk. Just 2 quick questions, if I might. Could you talk a little bit about some of the reasons behind the improvement in the On-Premise Remedy product line? Robert E. Beauchamp Yes. The first answer is Remedy 8.0 is an outstanding product. I continue to see some solid reports back on wins. Customers love the functionality. Remember, it\'s a -- going forward, it\'s a SaaS first model. So the functionality that we add on Remedy will be delivered in SaaS and then moved over to 8. So it\'s really designed from the beginning to be a flexible platform for our customers to go from SaaS to On-Prem. It\'s been very much modernized on its user interface on the ease of implementation, the time to implement. I think I mentioned before that we\'ve received notes on how -- and seeing customer comments on how easy and fast it is to implement. So it\'s just a really good solid product. That\'s Part 1. Part 2 is that the -- I think some of the initial thought that all customers were going to move to SaaS is no longer the case. Customers are now, and as I mentioned, a large U.K. bank, these are -- the customers are doing whatever the best fit is. So if you are a company in, say, Department of Defense and you may very well want to go with an On-Prem model, highly secure. If your performance requirements are of a certain nature, you might want to do it On-Premise. So customers will pick On-Prem for certain capabilities and SaaS for others. And BMC\'s able to offer both of them to the customer. But the short answer is, Remedy 8.0 is a very solid product and much easier to install and implement. I would caveat it, that right now, that we\'ve got 1 quarter under our belt and I want to see probably 2 more quarters -- we\'ve had 2 quarters, excuse me, of On-Prem performing well on a total bookings basis. Let me get 2 more quarters under our belt before we declare victory on that. Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division Sounds good, fair enough. And then secondly, could you just talk a little bit about the MyIT product and how that\'s being received. And I know it\'s early there as well, but any sort of color on when that might actually start to have an impact on the ESM side? It would be helpful. Robert E. Beauchamp Sure, sure. So it won\'t ship until April. The -- so it won\'t have much -- it won\'t have, really -- no impact, really, on its own SKU until then. I think it’s already having an impact with customers who are trying to decide whether to go with our IT service management platform and they see the vision of how the MyIT is taking, basically making the help desk disappear. So you\'re not calling and calling someone on the phone and asking them to opening a trouble ticket. You\'re dealing with your IT service request the same way you deal in your personal life, doing online banking and various other things. So it\'s really changing the game. It\'s abstracting the engine in the back, whether it\'s Remedy 8.0, or Remedyforce, or Remedy OnDemand, or even competitive products. It abstracts those in the background and it brings the service desk -- so it\'s your own personal IT service desk that you carry with you as an employee of the company. And so I think we are winning deals for our other products because of the vision of MyIT. When we demo MyIT, it\'s as excited a group of customers as any product that I remember ever seeing demonstrations for. But I -- then I got to caution, we haven\'t sold one yet, right? The thing doesn\'t go on sale until April. And so I don\'t know what I don\'t know, and I\'m sure we\'ll find something that is -- that we\'re going to have to deal with. I just don\'t know what it is yet. But so far, early indications are MyIT is really, really kind of game changing way of thinking about how to do IT delivery. Operator We\'ll now go to James Wesman with Raymond James. James Wesman Steve, just a quick question for the model. Looking at new share repurchase expectations for fiscal \'14, what would you consider to be more reasonable, should we think of it in terms of fiscal \'12, where we saw a mid-single digit decrease year-over-year? Or something close to fiscal \'11, where there was a low single-digit decrease? Stephen B. Solcher Well, \'14, the biggest difference between \'13 and \'14 is, is you don\'t get the full effect of the ASR in fiscal year \'13. And it\'s strictly due to the timing of the waiting. So we took the ASR, went into effect November 23, and even though we took 13.1 million shares out at that point in time, there are still almost another 6 million shares that will not come out until the end of June. And that\'s the true up period of time. We have 7 months to take the buying pattern of the ASR to 750. So \'14, what you\'re going to see is really the impact of that full waiting and we\'re going to start, if you -- when you do read the Q, you\'re going to see that we\'re already at a shares outstanding count of 142 million. So from where we are today, we\'re starting January 1 with a share count -- outstanding shares of 142 million. I don\'t know if that helped or made it worse. Operator We\'ll go next to Phil Winslow with Crédit Suisse. Sitikantha Panigrahi - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division This is for Siti Panigrahi for Phil Winslow. You mentioned the 2 large MSM deals slipped in Q3. So just wondering, maybe could you give some color about the reasons for the deals slippage? And also in general, what are you seeing in terms of pricing and competition in the mainframe business? Robert E. Beauchamp Yes. So a couple of things on -- to answer your first question. The 2 deals were contract renewal expirations in Q4, where the customer called and requested that we try to negotiate a deal in Q3, which is not uncommon at all. And in fact, I\'d say it\'s more common that a certain percentage of every quarter has that request. We worked with the customer on that. And in both cases, at the end of the quarter, they pushed and said, we\'ll do it in Q4 when we have to. So I don\'t have to, but when it\'s scheduled. And so we have good confidence in both of those transactions in Q4. And that\'s very normal for MSM. The second question was -- remind me again -- oh, pricing. Pricing is good. Let me give you an example. So IBM, on mainframe, IBM is shipping these specialty engines, and one of the advantages, our product, we\'re really focused on trying to add more functionality to our products so that we cannot be kind of in a commodity just to speed and feed, but actually offer capabilities that are not just faster but different than our competition. And one of the functions that we have as part of our mainframe cost optimization initiative is the ability to help customers move workload from the GPM engine to the specialty engine. So by moving that workload, we cut the customers bills that they have to pay back to IBM significantly. And in exchange for that, we like to charge a little more for that capability because we have that unique capability. So price points -- I mean, in general, pricing is always under pressure, it\'s always a competitive market. There\'s always a lot of customer pressure to work our prices and we will. But we feel good about how we\'ve been able to hold our prices up, our price points up, by adding the customer with more capabilities, and specialty engine\'s a good example of that. All right. Again, thank you, all, very much. We will be talking with you, I\'m sure, throughout the quarter. And please call if you\'d like to arrange more time. Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Hann.  Please go ahead sir. Dan Hann Thank you, Stacy.  Good morning and welcome to Biomet’s first quarter conference call.  Joining me this morning is Greg Hartman, our CFO; Chuck Niemier, President of Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine; Garry England, COO for Domestic Operations; and Greg Sasso, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Communications. To address any forward-looking statements made during the course of this conference call, we refer you to the paragraph regarding forward-looking statements included in Biomet's first quarter press release issued earlier this morning. We will begin with sales.  During the first quarter of fiscal ’07, net sales increased 5% to $508.2 million. International sales increased 9% while sales in the US increased 3%.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which increased first quarter sales by approximately $3 million, net sales increased 4% worldwide.  We are pleased that Biomet continues to gain market share in the domestic and worldwide reconstructive device market, principally is a result of a significant number of new product introductions and technologies that have recently been launched to our customers.  However, the company’s fixation spinal sales were $12 million below management’s expectations during the first quarter of fiscal ’07.   The company has implemented numerous changes in its Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine operations formerly known as EBI.  First, we appointed Biomet’s former COO of International Operations, Chuck Niemier, with a proven operational track record as President of Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine.  Other key senior management changes at Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine include the appointment of a new Vice President of Finance, with significant financial management experience, most recently with Aircast; and a new Vice President of Sales with over 20 years of sales management experience with J&J Orthopedics and Biomet Orthopedics. While the revenue numbers at Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine were disappointing during the first quarter, I can assure you that significant progress is being made.  We have implemented a new computer system, replacing the outdated system at the former EBI operation.  Additionally, sales support systems which allow the sales representative to place orders directly into the system have recently been installed and will continue being installed over the next quarter.  Furthermore, we have begun in-sourcing the manufacture Biomet Spine’s hardware system and within the next nine months we plan to be manufacturing all the company’s spinal hardware systems in-house. Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine is currently adding research development and engineering team members in order to accelerate the introduction of new products to its customers.  Indeed, Biomet Trauma will launch approximately 12 new products during fiscal ’07, while Biomet Spine will introduce approximately 15 new products during this fiscal year, including ten products that will be shown in North American Spine Society (NASS) meeting next week in Seattle.   We’ve critically examined the former EBI staffing needs and we have eliminated 330 physicians, or approximately 15% of EBI’s workforce, since May 31, 2005.  These reductions should allow Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine to show positive earnings growth throughout the remainder of fiscal ‘07. Reconstructive device sales increased 9% worldwide to $351.7 million during the first quarter and increased 8% in the U.S.  Knee sales increased 11% worldwide and in the United States during the first quarter, against last year’s first quarter growth rate of 17% worldwide and 16% in the U.S.  Excluding instruments, knee sales increased 11% worldwide and 12% in the US.  With last quarter’s knee market growth estimated to be 6.5% worldwide and 8% in the US, we continue to be pleased with the market share gains we were achieving in knees.   First quarter knee sales growth was driven by continued strong demand worldwide for the Vanguard Complete Knee System and the Oxford Unicompartmental Knee System.  The Vanguard Complete Knee System, the most comprehensive total knee system on the market today, provides full interchangeability of the system’s femoral and tibial components to address virtually any anatomical difference regardless of the patient’s race, gender, stature or any other variables. The Vanguard is engineered to provide precise fit for all patients while providing greater bone preservation and competitive high flex systems.  The Vanguard System can be implanted using Biomet's microplasty minimally invasive knee instruments or the Vanguard premier instrumentation.   Biomet continues to lead the market in minimally invasive total knee instrumentation as a result of its pioneering work and its technology.  Approximately 1,300 sets of Biomet’s microplasty knee instruments have been released in the U.S. during the past three fiscal years. The Vanguard premiere instrumentation rollout continued during the first quarter with approximately 270 sets now in the field.  The premier instrumentation is designed for implantation of the Vanguard System utilizing a conventional open procedure.   The Oxford Unicompartmental Knee System, the only true mobile uni-knee approved for sale in the U.S. has experienced excellent long-term clinical success outside the United States.  Results include a 98% success rate at ten years follow up, 95% success at 15 years, with 93% success reported at 20 years. During the first quarter of fiscal ’07, 160 domestic surgeons completed Oxford-specific training with approximately 1,500 surgeons trained during the past two years.  During the second quarter, training for the Oxford system is planned for an addition 125 surgeons.   Biomet’s new revision knee system, the Vanguard SSK Super Stabilized Knee, continued to receive excellent market acceptance during the first quarter, as well as the Vanguard PFR patellofemoral replacement, a conservative treatment option for patients with cartilage degeneration isolated in the front mid section of the knee.   On October 25th,  the California hospital medical center in Los Angeles will broadcast the first live webcast of the implementation of the Vanguard SSK Revision System which will be performed by Dr. Edward McPherson of the Los Angeles Orthopedic Institute. The Vanguard SSK features various modular options that provide surgeons with the ability to customize the implant to accommodate the specific needs of an individual patient.  Additionally, the modularity of the Vanguard SSK gives surgeons the ability to address complex bone defects often present in revision cases.   During the first quarter, we also continued to roll out Vanguard anterior stabilized implants and instruments.  Additionally, the enrollment with the IDE study relating to the rotating platform version of the Vanguard was initiated during the quarter. Next we’ll look at hip sales.  During the first quarter, hip sales increased 8% worldwide and 3% in United States against last year’s first quarter growth rate of 12% worldwide and 7% in the United States.  Excluding instruments, hip sales increased 9% worldwide and 4% in the U.S.  Biomet’s alternative-bearing products continued to repeat strong worldwide market acceptance during the first quarter while the M2a-Magnum continued to further penetrate the metal-on-metal acetabular market.   Metal-on-metal acetabular system sales experienced 11.5% growth in Europe during the first quarter with 9% growth in the United States.  Biomet C2a-Taper Acetabular System featuring ceramic-on-ceramic articulation and our proven porous plasma spray coating technology, continued to experience strong market acceptance in the U.S. with the introduction in fiscal year 2006. The bone-conserving ReCap Total Resurfacing System, which is indicated for  patients in the early stages of degenerative joint disease continues to experience strong market acceptance in Europe. In the U.S., 8 sites have been approved to participate in the IDE study for the Recap Total Resurfacing System and we continue to enroll patients with additional sites pending approval.   Biomet’s Taperloc porous coated hip stems continued to repeat excellent market demand worldwide during the first quarter.  In Europe, the Aura, Aura II and the Biometric stems also experienced strong demand during the first quarter.  Also, in Europe the bone master hip implant was introduced to the market, which is the first hip device to be offered with hydroxyapatite coating. Clinical trials are ongoing in the US for a new generation of bone-sparing primary hip stems.  The new balance and Taperloc Microplasty hip system will offer the industry’s first and most advanced design features for modern hip stem while maintaining the clinically proven Biomet’s design philosophy.  The design rational for these reduced length component wills be suited to those surgeons offering minimally invasive hip procedures along with surgeons whose design preference is proximally coated primary hip.  Surgeon feedback continues to be positive with more than 225 Microplasty stems implanted during the past five quarters. Biomet initiated the launch of the Microplasty ASI, Anterior Supine Intramuscular Hip Program and began conducting cadaver lab training sessions for surgeons in the U.S. and Europe during the past quarter.  To-date, approximately 100 ASI instrument sets have been rolled out and more than 80 surgeons have received ASI training with additional ASI labs scheduled throughout fiscal 2007. ArComXL, Biomet’s highly crosslinked polyethylene, continued to receive excellent market acceptance during the first quarter.  ArCom provides a 47% to 64% decrease in volumetric wear rates over standard ArCom in laboratory studies and offers a 30% increase in ultimate tensile strength along with similar wear-particle shape and size  with no measurable oxidation exhibited for cell rated agents. Clinical evaluations are underway for Biomet’s Regenerex Titanium Construct, and we are scheduled to initiate the launch a Regenerex cup and augment midway through this fiscal year.  As a result of Biomet’s pioneering efforts, Titanium has become a clinically proven material in the orthopedic market, resulting in optimal biological fixation.  We believe the long-term clinical success of Biomet’s Titanium implants will translate into strong demand for Regenerex as the material of choice for porous metal constructs. Turning now to extremities, sales increased 13% worldwide during the first quarter and increased 8% in the United States.  Extremity products that experienced strong worldwide growth during the first quarter include the Discovery Elbow, Copeland [Humal] Resurfacing Head, Comprehensive Fracture Stem, ExploR Radial Head Replacement and the Maestro Wrist Reconstructive System, as well as the test shoulder system which is available in Europe. The Discovery Elbow is a bone-sparing device that features an improved hinge design and utilizes an ARCOM direct compression molding polyethylene bearing.  The bone conserving propylene shoulder is a resurfacing system used to treat patients in the early stages of degenerative joint disease.  The comprehensive fracture stem is utilized to treat complex shoulder fractures, while the ExploR Radial Head Replacement continued to receive excellent market acceptance during the first quarter due to its modular design, including a tapered stem and a head design to articulate with the patient’s natural bone.   The Maestro Wrist can be used as a total wrist device for hemiarthroplasty for carpal replacement.  Test shoulder, which is contributing to extremity sales growth in Europe, provides for maximum bone preservation due to its anatomical design and requires only one instrumentation system or implantation of all designs included in the system, including hemiarthroplasty as well as anatomic and reverse shoulder prosthesis. Sales of bone cement and accessories increased 9% in the United States during the first quarter and decreased 11% worldwide.  These growth rates were up against last year’s growth of 9% in the U.S and 16% worldwide. Biomet’s Cobalt and Cobalt bone cements received good market acceptance in the United States during this past quarter.  Biomet’s Stage One Cement Spacer Molds continued to receive excellent market acceptance during the quarter, as the Spacer Mold offers surgeon an advantage over the conventional handmade and pre-made cement spacers.   Biomet initiated the rollout of the Stage One Cement Hip Spacer Molds during the fourth quarter and the full release was completed during the first quarter.  We offered wide webcast training sessions for the Stage One Hip Spacer Mold during the first quarter, with more than 100 individuals participating in the training. Now, let’s transition to dental.  During the first quarter, dental reconstructive device sales increased 11% worldwide and in the United States.  During the first quarter, a limited release for NanoTight surface technology was initiated for the Prevail and the straight wall Certain Implant designs.  Approximately 150 customers worldwide were invited to participate, with full product release planned for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.  NanoTight is a hydroxyapatite surface treatment that will initially be used on 3i’s Certain and Prevail Implant systems.  This technologically advanced surface treatment incorporates a discrete crystalline deposition of nanoscale calcium phosphate, which is applied to 3i’s existing OSSEOTITE surface substructure.   The treatment offers a marked improvement of implant integration performance in terms of the quality of the bone implant interface as well as the speed of Osseo conduction, providing a more rapid and predictable treatment. During the second quarter, 3i will focus on three key systems to drive growth during fiscal ’07, including: the straight prevail implant, the standard prevail implant and the enhanced NT, Natural Taper implant. Next we will turn to fixation sales.  Fixation sales decreased 5% worldwide to approximately $61 million during the first quarter and decreased 9% in the United States.  Internal fixation sales increased 1% worldwide during the first quarter and decreased 10% in the US.  External fixation sales decreased 11% worldwide during the quarter and decreased 16% in the US.  Electrical stimulation devices increased 8% worldwide and in the United States during the first quarter. New trauma products include the OptiLoc Periarticular Plating System, Biomet Vision Foot Ring System and the OrthoPak II.  The OptiLoc Periarticular Plating System’s proximal tibial plates will introduce during the first quarter.  During the second quarter, we plan to launch the OptiLoc system distal femoral plates which are designed for the fixation of lower extremity fractures in osteotomy.  Manufactured from titanium alloy, the distal femoral plates are anatomically contoured and incorporate the SphereLoc technology that allows either a locked or non-locked screw to be used in the same screw hole.  This comprehensive system offers color-coded implants and instruments for ease of use by the surgeon and the OR staff.  A third quarter launch of the Distal Tibial Plate is scheduled which will complete the lower extremity line. The recently introduced Biomet Vision Foot Ring system is a comprehensive external fixation system designed for the treatment of osteotomies, arthrodesis and fracture fixation indications.  This system offers a simplified snap-fit application of all fixation components to the Vision Ring  and can be configured into a multitude of constructs ranging from simple fractures to complex reconstruction.  The Vision Foot Ring System is made of a lightweight carbon fiber which has radial movement and also provides for increased patient comfort.  The OrthoPak II is a next-generation bone growth stimulation system for non-union fractures that offers rechargeable batteries for added patient convenience.  Additionally, a new foil specifically for finger fractures was launched. Craniofacial fixation sales decreased 4% worldwide during the first quarter and decreased 5% in the United States.  Products launched during the first quarter were the LactoSorb Pediatric Extraction device, the Thin-Flap low-profile cranial fixation system and the Sterile Track Neuro System.  Product introduction planned for the second quarter include the addition of longer screws, 14 and 16 millimeter to the SternaLoc product line for enhanced predictability and expanded out locations. Also scheduled for introduction during the second quarter is the Resorbable LactoSorb Pectus Stabilizer.  This is particularly important outside the US where the standard metal version of the Pectus Bar is not patent-protected.  The Resorbable version will differentiate the product in markets outside the U.S. and will be the preferred application for small frame patients throughout the world. In addition, we expect to introduce [Allogeneic] Plus during the first quarter.  This biomaterial combines our current lecithin-based Allogeneic demineralized bone matrix with pro-osteon granules resulting in an improved bone graft material.  By combing a scalpel with an osteo-inductive source into one product there will not be a need to subject the patient to a second procedure in order to harvest bone chips for use in the scalpel.  This also results in an economic benefit due to reduction in OR time that can be realized. Next, taking a look at the spinal product segment, sales decreased 6% worldwide to approximately $52 million during the first quarter and decreased 7% in the U.S.  Sales of spinal products and orthobiological products for the spine decreased 4% worldwide during the first quarter and decreased 5% in the United States, while spinal stimulation sales decreased 9% worldwide and in the United States. During the first quarter, the PEEK version of the ESL Elliptically Shaped Lumbar Spine System was launched in the US.  ESL's elliptical shape offers optimal surface contact with the [pitegral] body in place.  The availability of the ESL and PEEK material broadens the company’s product offering in the segment of the spacer market that addresses the direct posterior surgical approach. During the first quarter, we completed the rollout of the Polaris Spine System.  The Polaris is a next-generation Synergy Spine System offered in a 6.35 millimeter diameter top-loading rod system which utilizes patented helical flange locking technology.  Additionally, the rollout of the stainless steel version of the Array Deformity Spine System was introduced during the first quarter.  The stainless steel version broadens our product offering for the deformity correction system and builds upon the excellent early clinical experience of the original titanium version.  The Array System includes various styles of screws and rods for scoliosis correction.   The U.S. IDE clinical trial for the Regain Lumbar Nucleus Replacement pilot study was initiated during the first quarter.  The Regain is a rigid, one piece device made of pyrocarbon which is a highly compatible biomaterial.  The device is held in the disc space by the natural bony anatomy of the endplates.  The implant geometry is designed to maintain disc height and to provide for normal motion of the lumbar spine. We are expanding our osteobiologic product offering with the addition of the Biomet DBM platform.  Platform consists of freeze-dried sheets of de-mineralized bone matrix putty which can be hydrated using the Biomet Bone Marrow Aspirate Kit to produce a matrix that is osteo-conductive, osteo inductive and osteogenic.   During the first quarter, other product sales increased 5% worldwide to $43.6 million and increased 2% in the United States.  Arthroscopy sales increased 13% on a worldwide basis during the quarter and increased 6% in the United States.  [R Protect] products experienced excellent growth rates during the first quarter, include the EZLoc Femoral Fixation Device and the WasherLoc Tibial Fixation Device, as well as the InnerVue Diagnostic Scope System. Finishing up with soft goods and bracing, I am pleased to report sales increased 11% in the United States during the quarter and increased 10% worldwide. I would now like to turn the call over to Greg Hartman who will provide some financial details. Greg Hartman Thank you, Dan, and good morning.  Effective June 1, 2006, the company adopted the new accounting standard, SFAS 123 R Share-Based Payment using the modified prospective method.  In accordance with this adoption method, the company is not adjusting its historical financial statements to reflect the impact of share-based payments.  Adjusted results for the first quarter excludes the $0.02 per share impact relating to this accounting standard.  In connection with the $4.2 million expense relating to 123 R, $3.4 million is expensed in the SG&A line and $822,000 in R&D. The following discussion will focus on the company's results on an adjusted basis.  During the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, net sales increased 5% to $508.2 million.  Gross profit increased 5% to $369.4 million representing 72.7% of sales.  This is a 40 basis point improvement over the first quarter of fiscal year 2006.   SG&A expenses increased 5% to $186.6 million, representing 36.7% of sales.  R&D expenditures increased 13% during the first quarter to $23.5 million or 4.6% of sales.  Operating income increased 5% to $159.3 million with operating margins at 31.4% of sales representing a 20 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Net income increased 6% to $106.8 million while diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.44 per share. As far as the balance sheet is concerned, cash increased $32 million despite the $73 million dividend paid during the first quarter and the $7.2 million used to repurchase shares.  Accounts receivable decreased $14 million and days sales outstanding declined by four days to 88.  In the summer months when sales are softer, accounts receivable tends to decrease slightly.   Inventory increased $20 million during the first quarter and days sales and inventory increased 14 days to 349 days.  This increase is mainly in three areas:  Europe where a normal inventory build is planned during the summer slow months; 3i where the company is working to get out of a backorder situation; and Japan where the company is launching the Biometric XR and the Vanguard RP. Cash flow from operations totaled approximately $139 million during the first quarter.  With regard to the share repurchase plan, we repurchased 210,000 shares during the first quarter for an amount of $7.2 million.  Since December 2001, the company has repurchased approximately $32.6 million of its common shares for an aggregate cash amount of $1.064 billion. Dan Hann Thank you, Greg.  During the second quarter, we estimate foreign currency will positively effect results by $4 million to $5 million.  Consequently, we are comfortable with sales and earnings estimate of $519 million to $540 million and $0.44 to $0.46 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 respectively. I am pleased with the sales growth of the orthopedic reconstructive device category, particularly our knee product category which continue to experience strong market demand with double-digit growth during the first quarter of fiscal '07.  Biomet orthopedic continues to lead the market with the introduction of innovative products and technologies, along with its broad product portfolio of clinically-proven products.  As mentioned earlier, much work is being done to improve our trauma and spine operations and we are confident that these teams are capable of producing incremental top and bottom line improvement as we progress through fiscal year 2007. Thank you.  With that, we would like to open it up to questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator We will go first to Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities Thank you. Good morning guys. Just a few questions. In EBI, you mentioned reduced head count of since May of '05. Had the reduction been pretty consistent during that period, or is it more recently? Did that have an impact in this past quarter, since it looks like most of the EBI segments did take a step back sequentially? Dan Hann  A lot of the reduction has taken place this past quarter. This has certainly been a quarter of many, many changes, as you gathered. Admittedly, it was a difficult quarter. We were not making the progress initially we had hoped, so we started instituting more changes, beginning with Chuck Niemier taking over the Presidency of that operation. We've also eliminated some additional senior positions. We now have a new Vice President of Sales, which I mentioned; and a new Vice President of Finance, both of whom started during this past quarter, and a Vice President of Manufacturing, and Marketing.  But the Vice President of Sales has made numerous changes already during the quarter. We are turning over the lower end of the sales force, for example, putting in place new compensation plans. Frankly, we're making many difficult changes now, in order to grow sales and earnings in the future. As I mentioned before, going through the conversion of a new computer system this quarter, beginning to in-source our spinal hardware manufacturing, all of these changes create a great deal of disruption. But, yes, we have let go a number of people during the first quarter. Chuck Niemier  Just also to clarify, our sales force is down almost 5% in size and quantity, and that does make up a portion of the number that Dan referenced. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities  Sure. Dan and Chuck, in terms of where you stand today, do you anticipate some changes to continue here in the near term, so that process is going to continue here in the near term? Dan Hann  Yes. We are continuing to implement change and we will throughout the entire fiscal year. I would not expect changes of the magnitude we've seen during this past quarter, but we will continue to implement change as needed in our Spine and Trauma operations.  Chuck Niemier  I would agree with Dan on that. Obviously we want to get the changes done as quickly as possible, so we're on a hard push to get over this part of the process so that we can stabilize -- stabilize is probably the key term -- not only within the sales force, but within our team in-house. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities Great. Just changing course, with the artificial disks in the news this week. Can you just expand more on your comments regarding Regain? I think you mentioned it was a pilot study. So when would you estimate more pivotal, if that was what you said?  I think you mentioned that was lumbar, so what about on the cervical side? Dan Hann The Regain Lumbar Nucleus Replacement, we have started the pilot study this past quarter, actually late in the quarter, and that study will begin with 20 patients. Depending on the results of that study, it will move on to a pivotal study. In terms of the expected approval date, we're looking at 2011 as the earliest date for the Regain Lumbar. As to our cervical disk project, I think that as you correctly stated, that's the Rescue cervical disk. That will be the same regulatory process, and we intend to start the pilot study within the next ten to 12 months. There the expected approval date would be some time, if everything goes according to schedule, in about 2012. Chuck Niemier  To add to that also, the story of our competitors, they are going to get in the disk market, obviously quicker than we are. It's obviously not a situation that we're pleased with, but at the same time our competitors have gotten in on a quicker pathway, by acquiring technology from smaller start-ups farther down the regulatory pathway. We're looking at some opportunities now, and we're going to kick them around and see what makes sense, to see if we can't get to the market quicker than the dates that Dan emphasized. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities Just lastly on that, it seems like those timelines are a bit of a push out. Is that right, and has there been any design changes, or what has happened in terms of the timeline there? Dan Hann  Well I think these timelines have been pretty consistent now for the past few quarters. We have not, to my knowledge, there are no design changes that we've implemented. I would also add we do have several posterior motion preservation projects in R&D as well. So that's where we are today. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities  Got it. Okay, thanks, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch. Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch I just wanted to ask a question regarding your distributors. Dan, I know you had talked about changing some things in terms of requiring a minimum number of reps to get some better coverage out in the field. Has that happened yet? If not, when? Would it initially be disruptive, or would that be a relatively smooth transition when you go through that process? Dan Hann  Katherine, if I can ask for a clarification. Which sales force are you referring to?  Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch  I'm sorry, I believe you were doing it on the reconstructive side. Dan Hann This year we are aggressively adding people on the orthopedic side. Frankly, it's been going very well. I don't have the specific numbers in front of me right now, but we're pleased with the growth and the programs that are being implemented in that area. We are giving incentives to our distributors from a commission point of view to add more reps, for example. Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch Then just a clarification: with the 5% decline in the sales force, was that specific to the EBI division? Greg Hartman  Yes, yes it was. Dan Hann  Yes. It was specific to EBI. Katherine, I would add, a lot of that is self-inflicted. As we discussed last quarter, we're trying to lift up that sales force and you're going to have some natural churning of the bottom rung as you start to build it. Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch  So just in terms of expectations, are you guys going to self-inflict for a couple more quarters? When do we think it would stabilize, versus starting to see net increases? Dan Hann  Well, in all honesty, I would not expect to see meaningful change coming out of Spine and Trauma until the back end of this fiscal year. Then as we start to drive the top line, I believe you'll see the earnings driven as well. Chuck Niemier  I'm repeating from the last question, I mean we're in a stabilization mode right now. We've had significant turnover in the sales force based out of Parsippany, and we've got to get it stabilized, we have got to get it trained, and we have got to get it appropriately organized and appropriately managed. Greg Hartman  But getting back to your Biomet orthopedics question, Katherine, our goal is to increase that sales force here in the U.S. by about 10% to 15% in 2007. Dan Hann One final thing, coming back to your self-inflicted question, again as I pointed out, this past quarter has been a quarter admittedly of many, many changes.  I would expect to see the self-infliction to ramp down, as we get greater into this fiscal year. Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch  Great. Thanks so much. Operator Our next question comes from Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns Good morning, guys. Just specific to the Spine and Trauma businesses, do you expect negative growth all the way up until the end of '07, is that what you meant when you were just talking about the sales acceleration? Or is it going to be flat, low single digits? Dan Hann  Well, not having a crystal ball, and being in a very turbulent situation at this time, especially with all the changes we're making and the fact that we're trying to stabilize the sales force, if we can hold steady for the next couple of quarters, and then start to bounce, I think that would be a reasonable expectation. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns  Okay. And then just kind of a big picture question here, as you stabilize the sales force, how do you do that without really strong, new product flow at this point in time? I know you're probably going to be able to launch a couple more new products as you mentioned through the rest of this year, I guess it's a question of what comes first, the chicken or the egg? Greg Hartman Well I would argue we do have a fairly strong flow of products into the EBI sales force, Milt. Dan Hann Yes, our issues and our problems within Spine and Trauma are not a lack of good, clinically proven products. We have bigger issues related to restructuring the operation and execution. If you look at our just this fiscal year in the Fixation area, where the OptiLoc Periarticular Plating System, we had a first quarter launch of the Proximal Tibial OptiLoc, in the second quarter we're going to launch the Distal Femoral OptiLoc, in the third quarter we're going to launch the Distal Tibial OptiLoc Periarticulating Plating System. In  the Spine side, we've got the Polaris, the ESL, and the Solitaire system, that will all continue to, we believe, to drive sales as we get to the back end of the year. Chuck Niemier  Basically, I think it's maybe not the chicken and egg, it's more of what do you want? Do you want a good sales force and bad products, or do you want good products and a bad sales force? Obviously you would like good in both courts, but where we're at, we have a very young sales force, and they need to be trained, and we also need to get the fundamental blocking and tackling. It's been a common or very favorite term around Parsippany the last two-and-a-half months, is establishing fundamental blocking and tackling. That goes from a standpoint of not only developing the product, but producing it, getting it rolled out, having appropriate inventory control applications, scheduling, forecasting, all the stuff that's necessary, I think is just good Business 101 practices. It was in existence, it's starting to develop, I do truly believe we're pulling together now as a team, instead of disjointed components. But it's a $400 million operation, and it takes a lot of inertia to get it moving all in the same direction. What is probably critical of the whole calculation of getting there is time. You have to be a little patient, to get us where we need to go. But as far as the situation exists, it isn't anything I personally haven't experienced in my almost 26-year career with Biomet. We've had similar issues throughout other divisions for which I've been responsible, and the team that we've assembled there, these guys understand what needs to be done and collectively we're pulling together to get there. It's just a matter of getting established. Probably one of the biggest issues facing us at this point in time is with my change of responsibility, I also inherited a conversion to a complete new computer system. It's been an agonizing process, it is a process I've also been through before many times. But for those of you on this call that have experienced similar situations, it's difficult. It has caused disruption, and it's going to continue to cause disruption for another month or two, but hey, we're getting there. The thing I'm most proud of is the combined effort of our Warsaw team and Parsippany team in working through this process, and probably for the first time in the history of Biomet that we've got these two entities working together, and I've really got to applaud Dan in is efforts and his vision towards globalizing and centralizing our management function. If it wasn't for that, we would not be anywhere near as far along as we are at this point in time. So that gives me great hope for the future, that we're going to get the ship righted and we're going to move forward. Now the last thing I'd want to emphasize, I know it's not specifically the question, is it's awful nice to be going through this transition, and not have a working capital issue. That makes it a hell of a lot more palatable and probably easier. So all-in-all, I'd say it's going to be a positive situation long-term, but it's just going to take a little time to get to where we need to be. Operator  Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan Thank you, good morning. Can we turn to the Recon business for a minute? Your U.S. Recon business, hips grew in FY06 8%, knees grew 15%, but this quarter hips grew 3%, and knees grew 11%. Maybe we can start just by talking a little bit about that, and maybe you can give us a breakdown between units, price mix, and instruments. Thanks. Greg Hartman  Well, for the quarter in the knee, 10% was units, 2% mix price, minus 1% in instrumentation. As to hips, 2% units, 2% mix price, minus 1% instrumentation. That's the breakdown for the quarter for the U.S.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan I want to make sure I'm modeling correctly the impact of anniversarying some of your launches last year. As Biomet rolls out, for instance, these instrumentation sets you obviously see a benefit, but then as you hit those comparisons, you're going to have a drag because of that as we see the growth rate. How does that instrumentation comparison look over the next couple of quarters? Dan Hann  It will be a headwind, Mike.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Any thoughts on quantifying? Dan Hann  Well, it will be specifically difficult in the fourth quarter. If you recall last quarter, we rolled out quite a few knee instrument sets here in the United States, with respect to the Vanguard Premier instruments. We quantified that, it was an 8 percentage point increase to our knee sales in the fourth quarter.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Yes, I'm looking at that right now. How do we think about the mix price component as we go forward for the balance of the year? Dan Hann  I think we would see that as fairly stable. Greg Hartman As Dan indicated earlier, we've been around the 2 percentage point or so over the last several quarters, and we really don't see that changing that much.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Okay. Just making sure we're think about the right pieces. As we step back from this quarter, obviously EBI had some issues for this quarter versus what expectations were, and overall that obviously impacted your performance. As we look at the next quarter and the guidance you've given, we're assuming overall that the company has some reacceleration. What drives that? How much is it just better performance by EBI, is it a pickup in Recon, what drives the acceleration? Dan Hann  I would say it's a number of things, improvements on many different fronts. One, we hope to begin making some improvement in EBI gradually. We continue to drive the knee market very well. I would expect to see that continue. I would hope to see a little pickup on the hip side of the market. As you may recall, coming midway through this fiscal year, we will have the Regenerex launch. We also are optimistic about the balance in Taperloc Microplasty stems. I would certainly hope to see a little pickup in the dental recon market, although the growth was acceptable this quarter, this past quarter that market slowed just a little bit, as did recon. So we would hope that the markets as we get in for the next couple of quarters, pick up just a little bit, which will boost our growth.  We continue to do well, for example in extremities, and I would expect to see positive growth continuing along our extremities line, and we continue to make progress in bone cements. Remember, we will finally get over our headwind that we've had in bone cements for the past few quarters, in the second quarter or third quarter of this year. Greg Hartman  That's correct. Dan Hann  We're optimistic about the progress as we move through this fiscal year.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan Just to be clear, the deceleration we saw in the U.S. hip and knee business this quarter, do you think that was an anomaly? Is that going to reverse? Greg Hartman  I think you have to look at that, and compare it to what the market did, Mike. If you look at our 12% growth in knees, that's almost a 400 basis point improvement compared to the market's growth last quarter in the U.S. of a little bit over 8%. If you look at our 4% hip growth, which as Dan indicated, we weren't pleased with in the U.S., that was only about 100 basis point shortfall compared to where the market was. So I think that if you benchmark against the market, we together did fine. Dan Hann  Also on the hip side, remember we grew worldwide for the quarter 7% constant currency against a market growth of 4%. So outside the U.S., our hip growth was very solid, and we want to continue to build on that.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Okay, my last question here, I apologize. The expectation going forward is that you'll continue to grow perhaps slightly above market, but that market growth will accelerate, or market growth will remain the same? Greg Hartman  We think that the market growth will accelerate.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Okay. Greg Hartman  Mr. Hann has to run to a board meeting here shortly, can we have just one more question. Operator We'll take our last question from Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Thank you very much. Just a couple of quick questions. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you reiterate your full year guidance that you provided at the end of the last quarter? And if you didn't, could you comment on that? Greg Hartman What we do, Bob, is in the fourth quarter we will give guidance for the first quarter of the next fiscal year, and for the entire fiscal year. We just -- in the press release, and in Dan's comments earlier -- gave guidance for the second quarter. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  So does that mean that the guidance you provided for the full year previously stands? Greg Hartman  Well, I trust that Wall Street's going to adjust things based on where we came in this quarter. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Right -- no, I understand that those are two separate things. Guidance and where consensus falls out. So bottom line, you don't have any updated guidance for the full fiscal year? Greg Hartman  Like we said, we give guidance for that next quarter, and assume that Wall Street is going to put forth your own guidance, or your own estimates, I should say. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  I see. Got it. When do you think we can hear about clarity on the issue of current management structure, and the interim title for Dan right now, and just when will that be finalized, do you think? Dan Hann Well  I assume you've followed the press releases, but we did recently announce that our Board of Directors retained Heidrick and Struggles and McLoughlin and Associates, to assist the Board with the search for a permanent CEO. I think as I previously said, the Board is committed to moving expeditiously with this search, but unfortunately I can't give you a date certain that an announcement will be made. But please bear in mind that this is one of the most important decisions that a Board of Directors can make, so the Board is being deliberate, and they certainly have my full support. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers Great. Just two other really quick ones, back to Milton's question, what you're talking about for the Trauma and Spine business, what I think I heard is expectations for relatively flat growth over the next couple of quarters, and then an expectation that towards the end of the year, we might see a pickup in revenue growth. Is that what I heard? Dan Hann  Yes, I think that's what you heard. Greg Hartman  We also prefaced that with we don't have a crystal ball but that’s our objectives, and we're relatively confident that we're going to get there. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers Finally, on the U.S. hip number this quarter, do you think you felt any impact from Zimmer's wide diameter launch? Dan Hann  No, I don't think so. Again from a worldwide perspective, we were ahead of the market. We were down just a little bit compared to the rest of the market this quarter. No, I don't think so. Greg Hartman  I must have missed that press release, Bob. What did you say? Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Just that the metal-on-metal wide diameter had been launched -- Greg Hartman Their large diameter, yes. Dan Hann  No, we haven't seen any, it has not had an impact. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Okay. Thanks for taking the call. Dan Hann  Well thank you very much and with that, we look forward to speaking with you again during our second quarter call in December. Thank you again for joining us today.

It was in existence, it's starting to develop, I do truly believe we're pulling together now as a team, instead of disjointed components. But it's a $400 million operation, and it takes a lot of inertia to get it moving all in the same direction. What is probably critical of the whole calculation of getting there is time. You have to be a little patient, to get us where we need to go. But as far as the situation exists, it isn't anything I personally haven't experienced in my almost 26-year career with Biomet. We've had similar issues throughout other divisions for which I've been responsible, and the team that we've assembled there, these guys understand what needs to be done and collectively we're pulling together to get there. It's just a matter of getting established. Probably one of the biggest issues facing us at this point in time is with my change of responsibility, I also inherited a conversion to a complete new computer system. It's been an agonizing process, it is a process I've also been through before many times. But for those of you on this call that have experienced similar situations, it's difficult. It has caused disruption, and it's going to continue to cause disruption for another month or two, but hey, we're getting there. The thing I'm most proud of is the combined effort of our Warsaw team and Parsippany team in working through this process, and probably for the first time in the history of Biomet that we've got these two entities working together, and I've really got to applaud Dan in is efforts and his vision towards globalizing and centralizing our management function. If it wasn't for that, we would not be anywhere near as far along as we are at this point in time. So that gives me great hope for the future, that we're going to get the ship righted and we're going to move forward. Now the last thing I'd want to emphasize, I know it's not specifically the question, is it's awful nice to be going through this transition, and not have a working capital issue. That makes it a hell of a lot more palatable and probably easier. So all-in-all, I'd say it's going to be a positive situation long-term, but it's just going to take a little time to get to where we need to be. Operator  Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan Thank you, good morning. Can we turn to the Recon business for a minute? Your U.S. Recon business, hips grew in FY06 8%, knees grew 15%, but this quarter hips grew 3%, and knees grew 11%. Maybe we can start just by talking a little bit about that, and maybe you can give us a breakdown between units, price mix, and instruments. Thanks. Greg Hartman  Well, for the quarter in the knee, 10% was units, 2% mix price, minus 1% in instrumentation. As to hips, 2% units, 2% mix price, minus 1% instrumentation. That's the breakdown for the quarter for the U.S.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan I want to make sure I'm modeling correctly the impact of anniversarying some of your launches last year. As Biomet rolls out, for instance, these instrumentation sets you obviously see a benefit, but then as you hit those comparisons, you're going to have a drag because of that as we see the growth rate. How does that instrumentation comparison look over the next couple of quarters? Dan Hann  It will be a headwind, Mike.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Any thoughts on quantifying? Dan Hann  Well, it will be specifically difficult in the fourth quarter. If you recall last quarter, we rolled out quite a few knee instrument sets here in the United States, with respect to the Vanguard Premier instruments. We quantified that, it was an 8 percentage point increase to our knee sales in the fourth quarter.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Yes, I'm looking at that right now. How do we think about the mix price component as we go forward for the balance of the year? Dan Hann  I think we would see that as fairly stable. Greg Hartman As Dan indicated earlier, we've been around the 2 percentage point or so over the last several quarters, and we really don't see that changing that much.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Okay. Just making sure we're think about the right pieces. As we step back from this quarter, obviously EBI had some issues for this quarter versus what expectations were, and overall that obviously impacted your performance. As we look at the next quarter and the guidance you've given, we're assuming overall that the company has some reacceleration. What drives that? How much is it just better performance by EBI, is it a pickup in Recon, what drives the acceleration? Dan Hann  I would say it's a number of things, improvements on many different fronts. One, we hope to begin making some improvement in EBI gradually. We continue to drive the knee market very well. I would expect to see that continue. I would hope to see a little pickup on the hip side of the market. As you may recall, coming midway through this fiscal year, we will have the Regenerex launch. We also are optimistic about the balance in Taperloc Microplasty stems. I would certainly hope to see a little pickup in the dental recon market, although the growth was acceptable this quarter, this past quarter that market slowed just a little bit, as did recon. So we would hope that the markets as we get in for the next couple of quarters, pick up just a little bit, which will boost our growth.  We continue to do well, for example in extremities, and I would expect to see positive growth continuing along our extremities line, and we continue to make progress in bone cements. Remember, we will finally get over our headwind that we've had in bone cements for the past few quarters, in the second quarter or third quarter of this year. Greg Hartman  That's correct. Dan Hann  We're optimistic about the progress as we move through this fiscal year.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan Just to be clear, the deceleration we saw in the U.S. hip and knee business this quarter, do you think that was an anomaly? Is that going to reverse? Greg Hartman  I think you have to look at that, and compare it to what the market did, Mike. If you look at our 12% growth in knees, that's almost a 400 basis point improvement compared to the market's growth last quarter in the U.S. of a little bit over 8%. If you look at our 4% hip growth, which as Dan indicated, we weren't pleased with in the U.S., that was only about 100 basis point shortfall compared to where the market was. So I think that if you benchmark against the market, we together did fine. Dan Hann  Also on the hip side, remember we grew worldwide for the quarter 7% constant currency against a market growth of 4%. So outside the U.S., our hip growth was very solid, and we want to continue to build on that.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Okay, my last question here, I apologize. The expectation going forward is that you'll continue to grow perhaps slightly above market, but that market growth will accelerate, or market growth will remain the same? Greg Hartman  We think that the market growth will accelerate.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Okay. Greg Hartman  Mr. Hann has to run to a board meeting here shortly, can we have just one more question. Operator We'll take our last question from Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Thank you very much. Just a couple of quick questions. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you reiterate your full year guidance that you provided at the end of the last quarter? And if you didn't, could you comment on that? Greg Hartman What we do, Bob, is in the fourth quarter we will give guidance for the first quarter of the next fiscal year, and for the entire fiscal year. We just -- in the press release, and in Dan's comments earlier -- gave guidance for the second quarter. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  So does that mean that the guidance you provided for the full year previously stands? Greg Hartman  Well, I trust that Wall Street's going to adjust things based on where we came in this quarter. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Right -- no, I understand that those are two separate things. Guidance and where consensus falls out. So bottom line, you don't have any updated guidance for the full fiscal year? Greg Hartman  Like we said, we give guidance for that next quarter, and assume that Wall Street is going to put forth your own guidance, or your own estimates, I should say. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  I see. Got it. When do you think we can hear about clarity on the issue of current management structure, and the interim title for Dan right now, and just when will that be finalized, do you think? Dan Hann Well  I assume you've followed the press releases, but we did recently announce that our Board of Directors retained Heidrick and Struggles and McLoughlin and Associates, to assist the Board with the search for a permanent CEO. I think as I previously said, the Board is committed to moving expeditiously with this search, but unfortunately I can't give you a date certain that an announcement will be made. But please bear in mind that this is one of the most important decisions that a Board of Directors can make, so the Board is being deliberate, and they certainly have my full support. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers Great. Just two other really quick ones, back to Milton's question, what you're talking about for the Trauma and Spine business, what I think I heard is expectations for relatively flat growth over the next couple of quarters, and then an expectation that towards the end of the year, we might see a pickup in revenue growth. Is that what I heard? Dan Hann  Yes, I think that's what you heard. Greg Hartman  We also prefaced that with we don't have a crystal ball but that’s our objectives, and we're relatively confident that we're going to get there. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers Finally, on the U.S. hip number this quarter, do you think you felt any impact from Zimmer's wide diameter launch? Dan Hann  No, I don't think so. Again from a worldwide perspective, we were ahead of the market. We were down just a little bit compared to the rest of the market this quarter. No, I don't think so. Greg Hartman  I must have missed that press release, Bob. What did you say? Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Just that the metal-on-metal wide diameter had been launched -- Greg Hartman Their large diameter, yes. Dan Hann  No, we haven't seen any, it has not had an impact. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Okay. Thanks for taking the call. Dan Hann  Well thank you very much and with that, we look forward to speaking with you again during our second quarter call in December. Thank you again for joining us today.

Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today we are reporting strong March quarter results, with accelerating revenue growth and earnings per share up 10% over last year. We feel great about this performance. Revenue was $52.9 billion, near the high end of our guidance range. Global revenue was up 5% year on year, with growth accelerating from our December quarter performance. That's despite a $1 billion year-over-year revenue headwind from foreign exchange in the March quarter and a larger iPhone channel inventory reduction this year versus last year. iPhone sales were line in line with our expectations, and we're thrilled to see the continued strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus with its beautiful large display and dual-camera system. Our active installed base of iPhones grew by double digits year over year. And based on the latest data from IDC, we gained market share in nearly every country we track. Late in the quarter, we released the stunning (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition versions of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in recognition of 10 years of our partnership with RED. This relationship has given our customers an unprecedented way to contribute to the global fund and bring the world a step closer to an AIDS-free generation. We've seen wonderful customer response to these eye-popping new iPhones. For the second quarter in a row, our Services revenue topped $7 billion, and it's well on the way to being the size of a Fortune 100 company. We're very happy to see the deep level of customer engagement with the Apple ecosystem across all of our services. App Store momentum is terrific, with revenue growing 40% year over year to an all-time quarterly record. The number of developers offering apps for sale on our store was up 26% over last year, and we're thrilled to see their success. We also saw double-digit revenue growth from Apple Music subscriptions and iCloud storage and overall very strong growth in the total number of paid subscriptions for our own services and the third-party content we offer on our stores. Paid subscriptions now exceed 165 million. Apple Pay is experiencing phenomenal traction. With the launch of Taiwan and Ireland in the March quarter, Apple Pay is now live in 15 markets with more than 20 million contactless-ready locations, including more than 4.5 million locations accepting Apple Pay in the U.S. alone. We're seeing strong growing usage as points of acceptance expand, with transaction volume up 450% over the last 12 months. In the UK, for example, points of acceptance have grown by 44% in the last year, while monthly Apple Pay transactions have grown by nearly 300%. In Japan, where Apple Pay launched last October, more than 0.5 million transit users are completing 20 million Apple Pay transactions per month. And we're always excited to see our partners bring their customers new ways to use Apple Pay. You can now even send a Starbucks gift card via iMessage with just a touch. We're seeing great momentum from our powerful advances in Messages. In fact, at one point during the Super Bowl in February, customers were sending 380,000 Messages per second, more than double the previous year. A few weeks ago, we introduced Clips, a new app that's another great example of how we're continually making our products even more engaging, and it's off to a great start. With Clips, it's fun and easy to combine video, photos, and music on an iPhone or an iPad into great-looking expressive videos with great visual effects and titles just using your voice, then share your clips with friends through the Messages app or on social media. We had great Mac results during the quarter. Revenue grew 14% to a new March quarter record and gained market share thanks to strong demand for our new MacBook Pros. Our Mac business has generated over $25 billion in revenue over the past four quarters. We're investing aggressively in its future, and we are very excited about the innovation we can bring to the platform. We also updated our most popular sized iPad with a brighter Retina display and best-in-class performance at its most affordable price ever, and customer response to date has been very strong. iPad results were ahead of our expectations, and we believe we gained share during the March quarter in a number of major markets, including the U.S., Japan, and Australia. iPad remains the world's most popular tablet, and it's the primary computing device for millions of customers across the globe. Building on the momentum from the holiday quarter, Apple Watch sales nearly doubled year over year. Apple Watch is the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world, and we hear wonderful stories from our customers about its impact on their fitness and health. We're also seeing great response to AirPods, with a 98% customer satisfaction rating based on a recent Creative Strategy survey. Demand for AirPods significantly exceeds supply, and growth in Beats products has also been very strong. In fact, when we combine Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones, our revenue from wearable products in the last four quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company. In Greater China, we were very pleased to see strong double-digit revenue growth from both Mac and Services during the March quarter. We also had great results from our retail stores in mainland China, with total store revenue up 27% over last year and comp store revenue up 7%. These results contributed to our improving performance in Greater China. Through the first two quarters of fiscal 2017, our year-over-year comparisons improved significantly over the last two quarters of fiscal 2016. First half revenue was down 13% year over year, about a third of which was attributable to FX. That's in contrast to a 32% revenue decline in the second half of last year. Our March quarter results were in line with our expectations, and similar to the year-over-year performance we experienced in the December quarter. We continue to be very enthusiastic about our opportunity in China. We set a new March quarter record for India, where revenue grew by strong double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem, and we're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young, and tech-savvy population, fast-growing economy, and improving 4G network infrastructure. Apple Retail is entering an exciting chapter with new experiences for customers and breathtaking new store designs. With the opening of our newest store in Dubai this past weekend, we now have 495 retail locations worldwide. The new Apple Dubai Mall is a truly international store, with employees who collectively speak 45 languages, and are already welcoming customers from around the world. As Luca will discuss in a moment, today we're also providing an update to our capital return program. Given our strong confidence in our future, we're increasing the program size by $50 billion, bringing the total to $300 billion, and we're extending the timeframe through March of 2019. We're adding to our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years. We're very excited about our upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference taking place in San Jose next month. The conference is significantly oversubscribed, and we'll be welcoming thousands of attendees. We look forward to helping them learn about breakthrough technologies across all four of our software platforms – iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS – that enable developers to create incredible experiences for every aspect of customers' lives and improve the way they manage their homes, cars, health, and more. I'm very proud to mention that we recently released our 10th annual Environmental Responsibility Report, reflecting our amazing progress. In 2016, 96% of the electricity used at Apple's global facilities came from renewable sources of energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. We're now 100% renewable in 24 countries, including all of Apple's data centers. There's much more work to be done, but we're committed to leaving the world better than we found it. Closer to home, we're excited about moving into our new corporate headquarters, Apple Park, our new center for innovation. The main building on Apple Park is designed to house 13,000 employees under one roof in an environment that fosters even greater collaboration among our incredibly talented teams. We have many more ongoing investments in the United States economy, since Apple is a company that could only have been created in America. Through our innovative products and the success of our business, we're incredibly proud to support more than 2 million jobs in all 50 states, and we expect to create even more. Last fiscal year, we spent more than $50 billion in the United States with American suppliers, developers, and partners, and we continue to invest confidently in our future. Now for more details on the March quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $52.9 billion, and we achieved double-digit growth in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Our growth rates were even higher, over 20% in many other markets, including Brazil, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India, Korea and Thailand. Gross margin was 38.9%, at the high end of our guidance range. That's a sequential increase from 38.5% in the December quarter, which is particularly impressive given the seasonal loss of leverage, sequential foreign exchange headwinds of 100 basis points, and cost pressures on certain commodities. Operating margin was 26.7% of revenue and net income was $11 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.10, an increase of 10% over last year, and cash flow from operations was strong at $12.5 billion. For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 50.8 million iPhones, and we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.2 million units in the quarter, compared to a reduction of about 450,000 a year ago. So our iPhone performance was slightly better than last year on a sell-through basis. We had very solid iPhone growth in four of our five operating segments and experienced especially strong results in Western Europe, the Middle East, and our Rest of Asia-Pacific segment, all areas of the world where iPhone sales were up double digits. iPhone ASP was $655, up from $642 a year ago, thanks to a strong mix of iPhone 7 Plus and in spite of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. We exited the March quarter within our five to seven-week target channel inventory range. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong, not only with consumers but also with business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 96% customer satisfaction rating among iPhone 7 owners and 98% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, iPhone customer satisfaction was 95%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone. Turning to Services, we generated $7 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year over year and our best results ever for a 13-week quarter. We're very happy with the strong level of growth, especially given the tough compare to last year, as the busy week between Christmas and New Year's fell within the March fiscal quarter a year ago but was included in the December fiscal quarter this year. As we said last quarter, our goal is to double the size of our Services business by 2020. The App Store established a new all-time revenue record and grew 40% year over year. We continue to see growth in average revenue per paying account as well as the number of paying accounts across our content stores during the quarter. In fact, the quarterly increase in the number of paying accounts was the largest that we've ever experienced. And according to App Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating twice the revenue of Google Play during the March quarter. Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was up 14% year over year and set a new March quarter record. We sold 4.2 million Macs, up 4% over last year, compared to zero growth in the PC market according to IDC's latest forecast. Demand for MacBook Pro was very strong, helping to drive overall portables growth of 10%, twice the growth of the portables market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, we sold 8.9 million units, which was ahead of our expectations despite supply constraints throughout the quarter. We are very pleased to see iPad growth in the U.S. during the March quarter and revenue growth worldwide for our 9.7-inch and larger iPads over the last four quarters. iPad channel inventory was essentially flat from the beginning to the end of the quarter, and we exited just below our five to seven-week target range. iPad remains very successful in the segments of the tablet market where we compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 81% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in February, 451 Research measured consumer satisfaction rates for iPad that range from 95% for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to 100% for the 12.9-inch version. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, purchase intention for iPad was 69%. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 68% for the June quarter. All our products continue to be extremely popular and drive more buying transformation in the enterprise market. We set a new enterprise revenue record for the March quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue for the remainder of the year. Recently, Volkswagen selected iPhone as their corporate standard smartphone, so 620,000 employees around the world have the opportunity to enjoy the best-in-class mobile experience that iPhone offers. And Capital One has reimagined the customer banking experience by empowering their associates with Mac and Apple Watch and over 40 native iOS applications now running on nearly 30,000 iPhones and iPads. We're also seeing strong momentum with our enterprise partners, who are helping us deliver long-lasting innovation and differentiation for iOS versus competing platforms. The Deloitte partnership is off to a great start, with more than 115 customer opportunities in the pipeline across 15 different industries. SAP released the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS at the end of March, and over 3 million SAP developers now have an even better means to develop powerful iOS-native apps for the enterprise. The partnership with Cisco enables optimized performance of iOS devices over their networks and is generating a large and growing pipeline of sales opportunities across multiple verticals, including healthcare and financial services. And our partnership with IBM continues to drive greater productivity and innovation, with IBM Mobile First for iOS apps now in more than 3,300 client engagements. And with its Mobile at Scale offering, IBM recently closed an agreement to deploy 11,000 iOS devices at Santander Bank to drive digital transformation. Our retail and online stores produced great results, with strong revenue growth in all our geographic segments and 18% growth overall. Visitors to our retail and online stores were up 16% over last year, and we added four new stores during the March quarter. And with the opening of our store in Dubai last week, we're now at 495 stores in 18 countries. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $256.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.8 billion. $239.6 billion of this cash, or 93% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $11 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to $88.5 billion in term debt and $10 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We returned over $10 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and we spent $4 billion on repurchases of 31.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 17.5 million shares. And we retired 6.3 million shares upon the completion of our ninth accelerated share repurchase program in February. All these activities contributed to a net diluted share count reduction of 66.3 million shares in the quarter. We have now completed $211.2 billion of our $250 billion capital return program, including $151 billion in share repurchases. As Tim mentioned, today we're announcing an update to our program, which we are extending by four quarters through March of 2019, and increasing in size to a total of $300 billion. Once again, given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, we are allocating the majority of the program expansion to share repurchases. Our board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $175 billion level to $210 billion. We will also continue to net share settle vesting employees' restricted stock units. In addition, we're raising our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years. As we know, this is very important to many of our investors who value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.57 to $0.63 per share, an increase of 10.5%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2017. With over $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we're proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters we expect to return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12% of our market cap at the current stock price. We expect to continue to fund our capital return program with current U.S. cash, future U.S. cash generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, investment opportunities, and our financial outlook. We'll also continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of our program. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $450 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Luca, and we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Rebecca, may we have the first question, please? Question-and-Answer Session Operator First we'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yes, thanks. My first question is for Luca around gross margins. How were you able to expand gross margins sequentially and guide rather seasonally for the June quarter in light of what's going on in the memory market. And maybe if you can, comment in particular whether the hold back of payments to Qualcomm is benefiting you at all on gross margins year on year, and also whether your contracts around commodity prices is likely to hit gross margins by more in the back half of this calendar year. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Katy, a lot of questions. Let me take them one by one. Let me start with our performance for the March quarter, which we were very happy with. As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially. And this is in spite of the fact, as you know, that we lose leverage as we go from the December quarter to the March quarter. The foreign exchange headwind on a sequential basis was 100 basis points. Obviously, that was also a negative. And as you said, we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the memory side, particularly on NAND and DRAM. To offset that, and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities. And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through the year, that is of course also helping, given the profile of our gross margin for Services. So that answers the question around Q2. As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter. Again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage. We also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter, and the cost pressures on memory will remain. We expect to offset partially these impacts with other cost efficiencies, and again, with a mix shift towards Services. The impact on NAND and DRAM will continue to be there, and we expect it to be there. You know we don't guide past the June quarter, but we expect it to be there for the time being. On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now. So we didn't get any benefit in our P&L, in our margins, during the March quarter, and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay, thank you. And just a follow-up for Tim, as you noted in your remarks, the iPhone 7 Plus demand, it's selling incredibly well. And this was a product that was pretty severely supply-constrained in the December quarter. And I just wonder whether there are any lessons learned as you go forward into future product launches around how you manage the timing of announcing a product when there are supply constraints, and how you might work with the supply chain differently around ramping some of these components that have particular difficulties around the yields early on. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Katy, one of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. There was – wound up that demand was much stronger to the iPhone 7 Plus than we had predicted. And so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred early this past quarter. What did we learn from it? Every time we go through a launch, we learn something. And you can bet that we're brushing up our models, and we'll apply everything we learn to the next time. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China and give us some more color, especially as you're going through the year? And then obviously you won't talk about the next product launch, but just are there any shifts in demand with Greater China down 14%? Was it all iPhone, or a mix? Anything you can provide, and then I have a follow-up. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes, thanks for the question, Shannon. We saw in Q2 a performance that combined with Q1 to form the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus, we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before, compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus. Also, the Mac business did extremely well. The Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China, and we had extremely strong Services growth during the quarter in China. As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall and in China. They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter. And traffic – which for us is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell – traffic was up 27% year on year. And now seven of our top ten highest traffic stores in the world are in Greater China. And so that's the set of things that went in our direction, so to speak. On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind. And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. Also, where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones. And so that's the set of things on the plus and minus side. We did perform about where I thought we would. At least I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter, and it was. What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth, but improve – but make more progress. And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Great, thank you. And then I don't know if Luca wants to take this, but thoughts on cash usage. You increased your program, but you still have I think $160 billion of net cash and obviously continue to generate cash. So I'm curious as to, given some of the commentary that's come out of the administration, which I think most companies were expecting some sort of return, how do you generally think about what you need to run the business from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a strength perspective as we look forward to what hopefully will come through? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Shannon, you know how we run our capital return program. We've been pretty consistent during the last five years. Essentially for the last five years, the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors. That's what we've done with the program until now, and the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction. We know how much we need to invest in the business. We will never underinvest in the business. We're in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have. And given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of the free cash flow to investors. It's difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen. The program that we're announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country, and there's a lot that still needs to happen there, and we'll see. Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please? Operator From JPMorgan, Rod Hall. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start off just going back to the 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if you could comment on the unique number of users there. And I think you had made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user was up, or maybe that was you, Luca. But if you guys could just talk about any more color around that average revenue per user, it would be interesting to us. And then I have one follow-up to that. Thanks. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Yes, I'll take it, Rod. We don't disclose into the number of subscriptions. Of course, we're just giving you the total count of subscriptions that are out there. Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. There is some level of overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very, very large, obviously less than 165 million. But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in. It's a large number. And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we talked about 150 million. So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores. It's quite impressive to add 15 million subscriptions in 90 days. As we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores, particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently two things. We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot. And I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we value in this last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. So this very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on our stores, and that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits. What we're also seeing as we look at people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time. And we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. People start at a certain level and then they tend to spend more over time. And so obviously, the combination of people spending more over time and adding more people that are now actually spending on the stores contributes to this 40% growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year-over-year basis. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay, thanks, Luca, and then I had a follow-up for Tim. Tim, I wanted to just ask. The Services revenue keeps growing, and of course the profit contribution from that is growing. And we've also at the same time I think seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain key technologies, let's call them, that maybe you want to penetrate the market with. I just wonder if you could just comment a little bit on your strategy there in terms of the usage of that extra profit contribution from that Services business, how you intend to apply it to the rest of the business. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Rod, the way that we think about pricing is we come up with a price that we think is a good value for the product that we're delivering, and we do that on the hardware side as well as on the Services side. And so that's how we think about it. We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to subsidize the other or vice-versa. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, thank you very much. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Rod. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From UBS, Steve Milunovich. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Tim, could you comment on the opportunity in wearables? The watch, some people consider disappointing, had what seems to be a very good quarter, and ironically the competition almost seems to be fading in that part of the market right now. The AirPods of course are doing well. Do you see wearables: A), expanding over time into a broader product line; and B), increasingly being independent of the iPhone longer term? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks for the question. We have seen the watch as a really key product category for us since before we launched it. We took our time to get it right, and we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. And we're really proud of the growth of the business. The watch units more than doubled in six of our top ten markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter. And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it. As some people are doing when you begin to combine the watch revenues with the revenues for AirPods, and as you know, this was the first full quarter of shipments for AirPods. It's still very much in the ramping mode, and we're not coming close to satisfying the demand. And then add the Beats products that a group of our customers really enjoy as well, and look on the trailing 12 months – so this is not a forecast – that business was well into the Fortune 500. And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far. The watch hasn't out very long and AirPods has been out there for three, four months, and so we feel really great about it. Where does it go? I wouldn't want to comment on that, but we do have a really great pipeline here. And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth, the watch area is really hard. It in essence from an engineering point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. And so I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it. But we're very committed to it and believe that – it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger. Thanks for the question. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. And then there was a – you mentioned the 451 Research survey. They did have a couple findings that were interesting. One is a nine-year low in iPhone purchase intent, and that might just be where you are in the cycle. And the other was a declining retention rate in the U.S. toward 80%. Any comment on either of those and whether you're concerned? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I only glanced at it, and so I haven't had time to study it. But in general, what we are seeing, we're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone, which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones. And so that part is clearly going on, and it could be what's behind the data. I don't know, but we are seeing that in full transparency. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks for the question. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question, please? Operator From Bernstein, we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi. A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Yes, thank you. I have two as well. First, Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your recent decision and the rationale for withholding royalty payments to Qualcomm. And really specifically, I wonder what you believe is the risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response, such as withholding modem chip sales or potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world. And I'd like to understand your perspective on whether either of those are real risk to any degree. And why would Apple potentially take on those risks just in advance of what will arguably be your most significant and largest product launch in history? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what are called FRAND terms. FRAND stands for fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. That's both the price and the business terms. Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple. And so I don't believe that a – I don't believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see. In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. You don't know how much to pay. And so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, and there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there. And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that. Unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount, but right now we're depending upon the courts to do that. And so that is the thinking. The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value. And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is. It's not – it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don't think that's right, and so we're taking a principled stand on it. And we strongly believe we're in the right, and I'm sure they believe that they are. And that's what courts are for. And so we'll let it go with that. A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you. I was wondering if I could just follow up a little bit on iPhone demand. If I try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra week last quarter, I think sequentially iPhones declined about 27% if I make those adjustments. And that's actually quite a bit lower than the normal seasonality we would see from Q1 to Q2, which is typically closer to 20%. I understand your comments around China, but your comparison was 40 points easier this quarter relative to last quarter. And the growth rate improved only marginally, I think, when you adjust for the extra week. And then you made a final comment around a pause on iPhones. So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on, was the below sequential, at least by my calculation, growth rate in Q2 attributable to a pause? And can you characterize what you think upgrade rates are doing, perhaps broadly by geography, to help us better understand what might be happening, or whether there are competitive dynamics that also are at play here that, again, might be contributing to that pause and that sequential decline that I referenced? Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. There are a lot of questions there. Let me give you some color as I see it. In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units. And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. Last quarter, I'm sure other folks remember, was a 14-week quarter, and so you have to adjust the rates last quarter to get at what the underlying sell-through growth was. And so I think that when you do that, you're going to find that actually the year-over-year performance is similar between the quarters. In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders ever in any six-month period in the first half of this year, first half of this fiscal year to be precise. And we saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen. And so in four of the five operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth. And it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which is growing incredibly fast around the world. And so that's kind of the color I would add there, and hopefully some of that is useful for you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, thank you. I had a question for Luca first. Last year, you had a 4 million-unit channel inventory reduction for the iPhone in the June quarter. So just curious what you're expecting for this year just so we have an apples-to-apples comparison as we think about your guidance. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. As you know, Simona, we do not provide guidance around units and around channel inventory reduction, but our goal is always to have the right amount of weeks of inventory in the channel. And if you look at our history over the last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory in the June quarter, so I think it's a fair expectation to have. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you, and then just for Tim. Tim, you've been excited about the India market for some time and have made strides in establishing a retail, manufacturing, and R&D presence there. So just curious as you look at that market and the rollout of 4G there, is it reasonable for us to assume that Apple can sell something on the order of 10 million to 20 million iPhones there next year and then grow from there? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We make it a point not to forecast by geo. We just provide a current quarter forecast. But as hopefully you've seen as we began to give you more information about India, we've been investing quite a bit. We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts, and it is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the United States. And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. And so that and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please? Operator Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you very much and congratulations on returning to growth consistently. That's great. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments you mentioned India was growing double digit, which is great. But I believe if you look at geographic information, India is really underpenetrated from an Apple reception perceptive, but yet they have LTE, you have the iPhone SE, a lower priced iPhone. Do you think that say this next 12 – 18 months is going be a turning point, or is it more you need to work with the government to have Apple-owned stores or production there? Or what's it really going to take to get India going along because we think it's just truly a great opportunity? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We think it's a great opportunity too, and so we're bringing all the things that we brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in, and that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth. Phil [Schiller] was just over there opening a developer center last quarter, and so there are a ton of things going on there. And we agree that we are underpenetrated there. Our growth rates are good, really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. And so we're putting a lot of energy in, just like we have in other geos that eventually wound up producing more and more. So I'm very excited about it. The 4G network investment really began rolling in in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know. But they are moving fast. They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Great, thanks so much for the detail. That's greatly appreciated. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Jim.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator First we'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yes, thanks. My first question is for Luca around gross margins. How were you able to expand gross margins sequentially and guide rather seasonally for the June quarter in light of what's going on in the memory market. And maybe if you can, comment in particular whether the hold back of payments to Qualcomm is benefiting you at all on gross margins year on year, and also whether your contracts around commodity prices is likely to hit gross margins by more in the back half of this calendar year. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Katy, a lot of questions. Let me take them one by one. Let me start with our performance for the March quarter, which we were very happy with. As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially. And this is in spite of the fact, as you know, that we lose leverage as we go from the December quarter to the March quarter. The foreign exchange headwind on a sequential basis was 100 basis points. Obviously, that was also a negative. And as you said, we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the memory side, particularly on NAND and DRAM. To offset that, and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities. And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through the year, that is of course also helping, given the profile of our gross margin for Services. So that answers the question around Q2. As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter. Again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage. We also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter, and the cost pressures on memory will remain. We expect to offset partially these impacts with other cost efficiencies, and again, with a mix shift towards Services. The impact on NAND and DRAM will continue to be there, and we expect it to be there. You know we don't guide past the June quarter, but we expect it to be there for the time being. On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now. So we didn't get any benefit in our P&L, in our margins, during the March quarter, and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay, thank you. And just a follow-up for Tim, as you noted in your remarks, the iPhone 7 Plus demand, it's selling incredibly well. And this was a product that was pretty severely supply-constrained in the December quarter. And I just wonder whether there are any lessons learned as you go forward into future product launches around how you manage the timing of announcing a product when there are supply constraints, and how you might work with the supply chain differently around ramping some of these components that have particular difficulties around the yields early on. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Katy, one of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. There was – wound up that demand was much stronger to the iPhone 7 Plus than we had predicted. And so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred early this past quarter. What did we learn from it? Every time we go through a launch, we learn something. And you can bet that we're brushing up our models, and we'll apply everything we learn to the next time. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China and give us some more color, especially as you're going through the year? And then obviously you won't talk about the next product launch, but just are there any shifts in demand with Greater China down 14%? Was it all iPhone, or a mix? Anything you can provide, and then I have a follow-up. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes, thanks for the question, Shannon. We saw in Q2 a performance that combined with Q1 to form the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus, we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before, compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus. Also, the Mac business did extremely well. The Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China, and we had extremely strong Services growth during the quarter in China. As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall and in China. They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter. And traffic – which for us is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell – traffic was up 27% year on year. And now seven of our top ten highest traffic stores in the world are in Greater China. And so that's the set of things that went in our direction, so to speak. On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind. And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. Also, where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones. And so that's the set of things on the plus and minus side. We did perform about where I thought we would. At least I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter, and it was. What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth, but improve – but make more progress. And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Great, thank you. And then I don't know if Luca wants to take this, but thoughts on cash usage. You increased your program, but you still have I think $160 billion of net cash and obviously continue to generate cash. So I'm curious as to, given some of the commentary that's come out of the administration, which I think most companies were expecting some sort of return, how do you generally think about what you need to run the business from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a strength perspective as we look forward to what hopefully will come through? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Shannon, you know how we run our capital return program. We've been pretty consistent during the last five years. Essentially for the last five years, the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors. That's what we've done with the program until now, and the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction. We know how much we need to invest in the business. We will never underinvest in the business. We're in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have. And given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of the free cash flow to investors. It's difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen. The program that we're announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country, and there's a lot that still needs to happen there, and we'll see. Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please? Operator From JPMorgan, Rod Hall. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start off just going back to the 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if you could comment on the unique number of users there. And I think you had made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user was up, or maybe that was you, Luca. But if you guys could just talk about any more color around that average revenue per user, it would be interesting to us. And then I have one follow-up to that. Thanks. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Yes, I'll take it, Rod. We don't disclose into the number of subscriptions. Of course, we're just giving you the total count of subscriptions that are out there. Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. There is some level of overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very, very large, obviously less than 165 million. But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in. It's a large number. And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we talked about 150 million. So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores. It's quite impressive to add 15 million subscriptions in 90 days. As we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores, particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently two things. We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot. And I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we value in this last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. So this very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on our stores, and that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits. What we're also seeing as we look at people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time. And we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. People start at a certain level and then they tend to spend more over time. And so obviously, the combination of people spending more over time and adding more people that are now actually spending on the stores contributes to this 40% growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year-over-year basis. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay, thanks, Luca, and then I had a follow-up for Tim. Tim, I wanted to just ask. The Services revenue keeps growing, and of course the profit contribution from that is growing. And we've also at the same time I think seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain key technologies, let's call them, that maybe you want to penetrate the market with. I just wonder if you could just comment a little bit on your strategy there in terms of the usage of that extra profit contribution from that Services business, how you intend to apply it to the rest of the business. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Rod, the way that we think about pricing is we come up with a price that we think is a good value for the product that we're delivering, and we do that on the hardware side as well as on the Services side. And so that's how we think about it. We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to subsidize the other or vice-versa. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, thank you very much. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Rod. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From UBS, Steve Milunovich. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Tim, could you comment on the opportunity in wearables? The watch, some people consider disappointing, had what seems to be a very good quarter, and ironically the competition almost seems to be fading in that part of the market right now. The AirPods of course are doing well. Do you see wearables: A), expanding over time into a broader product line; and B), increasingly being independent of the iPhone longer term? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks for the question. We have seen the watch as a really key product category for us since before we launched it. We took our time to get it right, and we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. And we're really proud of the growth of the business. The watch units more than doubled in six of our top ten markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter. And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it. As some people are doing when you begin to combine the watch revenues with the revenues for AirPods, and as you know, this was the first full quarter of shipments for AirPods. It's still very much in the ramping mode, and we're not coming close to satisfying the demand. And then add the Beats products that a group of our customers really enjoy as well, and look on the trailing 12 months – so this is not a forecast – that business was well into the Fortune 500. And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far. The watch hasn't out very long and AirPods has been out there for three, four months, and so we feel really great about it. Where does it go? I wouldn't want to comment on that, but we do have a really great pipeline here. And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth, the watch area is really hard. It in essence from an engineering point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. And so I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it. But we're very committed to it and believe that – it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger. Thanks for the question. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. And then there was a – you mentioned the 451 Research survey. They did have a couple findings that were interesting.

Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We make it a point not to forecast by geo. We just provide a current quarter forecast. But as hopefully you've seen as we began to give you more information about India, we've been investing quite a bit. We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts, and it is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the United States. And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. And so that and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please? Operator Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you very much and congratulations on returning to growth consistently. That's great. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments you mentioned India was growing double digit, which is great. But I believe if you look at geographic information, India is really underpenetrated from an Apple reception perceptive, but yet they have LTE, you have the iPhone SE, a lower priced iPhone. Do you think that say this next 12 – 18 months is going be a turning point, or is it more you need to work with the government to have Apple-owned stores or production there? Or what's it really going to take to get India going along because we think it's just truly a great opportunity? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We think it's a great opportunity too, and so we're bringing all the things that we brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in, and that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth. Phil [Schiller] was just over there opening a developer center last quarter, and so there are a ton of things going on there. And we agree that we are underpenetrated there. Our growth rates are good, really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. And so we're putting a lot of energy in, just like we have in other geos that eventually wound up producing more and more. So I'm very excited about it. The 4G network investment really began rolling in in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know. But they are moving fast. They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Great, thanks so much for the detail. That's greatly appreciated. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Jim.

Riley Tristan Gerra - Baird Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research Operator Good morning and welcome to the Analog Devices Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I’d like to now introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain Alright. Good morning and thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining the Analog Devices second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. So let’s get through our disclosures. Note the information we are about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our commentary about ADI’s second quarter financial results, are adjusted for special items. When comparing our second quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also adjusted in the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Available reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today’s earnings release and on our web schedules which we have posted under the quarterly results section at investor.analog.com. As many of you know, we have completed the Linear Tech acquisition about halfway through our fiscal second quarter. And so we have included reconciliations in our Investor page that provide a greater level of detail into our standalone and combined results for the quarter. But at a high level, I will say that Linear contributed $208 million to our non-GAAP second quarter revenue. This number includes $60 million of purchase accounting adjustments that were made for U.S. GAAP purposes and relate to Linear Tech inventory that was in the distribution channel in North America and Japan when we closed the acquisition. At the end of the second quarter, there remains an additional $30 million of Linear inventory in the distribution channel, which we expect will be sold in its entirety in the third quarter. We have included this adjustment in our non-GAAP revenue expectations for the third quarter and no such adjustments are anticipated starting in the fourth quarter. And then the last point I will make and its information you should be mindful of is that the first quarter of our fiscal 2018 will be a 14-week quarter. Okay. So, with all that behind us, about to get the show on the road, I will turn it over to ADI’s CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince’s comments on the second quarter are for standalone ADI unless he specifies otherwise. And our business outlook for the third fiscal quarter relates to the combined company. Okay. Vince, all yours. Vincent Roche Thank you very much, Ali. Good morning, everyone. Well, it’s been a very busy period for ADI and I am pleased to share our results with you. Not only were our second quarter financial results stellar, but we completed the acquisition of Linear Tech in March and our integration work is going very well. So, let’s start with our financial results for the second quarter. ADI’s standalone revenue came in at $1 billion, a 2% sequential increase and a 28% increase over the prior year. These results were above our revised guidance on broad-based strength and we continue to see signs of a good business environment, particularly in the industrial market. Gross margins expended to 67.6%, which was above the high end of our guidance and the combination of higher sales, higher gross margins and tight control over operating expenses helped to expand operating margins to a robust 36% of sales. In addition, free cash flow margins, as a combined company, were also strong at 39% of revenue in the second quarter. As Ali mentioned, Linear Tech was part of ADI for about half the quarter and contributed $208 million in sales on a non-GAAP basis. And we are looking forward to a full quarter’s contribution in our third quarter. Now, let me give you some details of our performance by end market during the quarter and note that my remarks relate only to standalone ADI. The industrial markets at 46% of sales grew 15% sequentially in the seasonally strong second quarter and continued its year-over-year growth trajectory, increasing 20% over the prior year. Sequential revenue growth was broad-based across all industrial sectors and indeed regions. While business conditions are certainly more positive than they were at this point last year, our success is also the result of smart R&D investments across diverse industrial applications within factory automation, instrumentation, aerospace and defense and healthcare. Over several decades, ADI has carved as a leadership position in high performance signal processing, serving our tens of thousands of industrial customers where applications demand the highest levels of performance both in terms of signal chain and in terms of power optimization. In the near-term, our industrial customers are excited to gain access to the highly complementary portfolios of ADI and Linear Tech and are even more excited at the future of value creation opportunities made possible by our combination. The automotive market represented 15% of our sales in the second quarter and grew 8% sequentially and 9% over the prior year. Both sequential and year-over-year growth was broad-based across all automotive application areas and was strongest in safety and ADAS applications, while powertrain revenue increased, but at a slower pace. We supply thousands of products into dozens of automotive sub-applications and are gaining more dollar content as we further automate and electrify. The combination with LT dramatically strengthens our technology offerings in this market and expands additional dollar content opportunities across our very complementary customer base. The communications infrastructure market, at 18% of sales, grew 5% sequentially and 4% over the prior year. Sequential revenue growth in this market was led by wireless infrastructure applications where we are making very good progress with our RF and microwave and high-speed signal processing and integrated transceiver solutions. While we are, of course, only in the very early stages of 5G cellular infrastructure deployment, we believe that our optimized radio signal processing and power management solutions will be a very key driver of growth as channel counts increase and customers moved to phase their antennas to make the most efficient use of available spectrum with the highest reliability and performance. Of course, the wireless infrastructure market is one where Linear largely didn’t play and thus this market represents an opportunity to drive revenue synergies in the medium term. On a year-over-year basis, communications infrastructure growth was led by the wireline sector where ADI’s customers are benefiting from our position clocking, timing and control technologies in the 100-gig and beyond optical networking applications. And finally, consumer market revenues at 21% of sales decreased 24% sequentially as prosumer applications revenue increased and portable applications revenue came in better than planned. Compared to the prior year, both prosumer and portable applications revenue increased. So while our combined financial results were excellent, our near and long-term outlooks are equally bright. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Linear Tech, creating the high-performance analog market leader. As we said from the beginning, we are taking a best of both approach combining the best from ADI and LTC to come up with a new operating system to drive long-term profitable growth for our combined company and I am very pleased with the progress we have already made. We are optimizing processes across our selling, new product development, manufacturing and operations activities. On the sales side, the integration of our two sales forces has brought with it a tremendous degree of excitement and we have already identified many sales synergy opportunities. On the engineering side, our teams have come together at remarkable speed and have begun identifying product roadmap combinations that we expect over the long-term will accelerate our growth. On the manufacturing side, our teams have been focused on ensuring that we meet the upside demand and continue to deliver the highest quality products to our customers. Overall, our $150 million cost synergy target within 18 months of the acquisition is firmly on track. To give you some background, during the integration planning phase, the vast majority of actions needed to realize the synergy target were identified. And while many of the related actions have already been taken, we are only in the early stages of seeing the benefits of those synergies in our P&L. In addition we expect non-GAAP EPS accretion in our first full quarter as a combined company to be 15% and we expect earnings accretion to accelerate into fiscal 2018 as we begin to more fully realize the synergies from the transaction. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Ali for details of our financial performance in the second quarter. Ali Husain Great. Thanks Vince. Good morning everybody. Since the acquisition of Linear Tech occurred about half way through our second quarter, Linear Tech’s contributions to ADI’s results were limited to approximately seven weeks and my prepared remarks will exclude Linear’s results and other special items unless I specify otherwise. Note that a schedule reconciling our standalone and combined performance can be found in our Investor page at investor.analog.com and a reconciliation of our combined GAAP performance to our combined non-GAAP performance can be found in schedules E and F of today’s earnings release. So revenue in the second quarter increased to $1 billion growing 2% sequentially and 28% over the prior year and was above our revised guidance. Sequential revenue growth was led by our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure, which in the aggregate grew 11% sequentially and importantly 14% over the prior year. Gross margins in the second quarter were 67.6%, up 150 basis points from the 66.1% we achieved in the prior quarter, primarily the result of higher utilization rates. Days of inventory increased 3 days to 104 days and dollars of inventory increased $12 million sequentially as we increased production to match strong demand. Deferred revenue for shipments in the distribution increased 6% sequentially and weeks of inventory in distribution were at seven weeks, which was consistent with the prior quarter. Operating expense of $318 million increased 4% sequentially due to the natural lift from higher activity in the second quarter and as compared to the first and higher variable compensation in the second quarter as our bonus program responded a better year-over-year revenue growth and operating profit in the quarter. As a result, operating margins of 36% of sales expanded 500 basis points compared to the prior year on strong revenue growth, higher gross margins and prudent expense management by the team. So now for P&L line items below the operating margin line, I will talk to results on a combined company basis, excluding special items, outlined in today’s release. Other expense in the second quarter was $59 million, the result of a partial quarter with the financing related to the Linear Tech acquisition in place. We expect our net interest expense to be approximately $70 million in the third quarter and approximately $60 million per quarter thereafter. Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 10% and that’s the rate we expect for the remaining two quarters of the year. We are also planning for a non-GAAP tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 15%, so note that will be higher than the 10% rate this year. Our diluted share count increased in the quarter due to the equity consideration related to the acquisition. Since this is a weighted average calculation, the diluted share count in 2Q increased to 346 million shares and we expect diluted share count in the third quarter, which will be our first full quarter as a combined company to be approximately 375 million shares. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2017 was $1.03. The second quarter was also a very strong free cash flow quarter. As a combined company, we generated $475 million in free cash flow in the second quarter. And for the reported trailing 12 months, the combined company has generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, which translates to free cash flow margins of 37%. Now this level of free cash flow generation is noteworthy for several reasons. First, it reflects the strength of our business model and our brand. Second, it means that our EBITDA generation was also very strong. And this means that we are better positioned from a leverage ratio standpoint at the current time than we had – than we have communicated to you earlier. So as a result, our net debt to EBITDA ratio based on reported combined company results is in fact approximately 3x, which is significantly lower than the 3.8x net debt to EBITDA number that we had estimated when we announced the deal. So moving to capital additions, which in the second quarter were $47 million for the combined company and are planned to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million for the year in 2017. During the quarter, we also paid $139 million in dividends and earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on June 20 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 9. And that represents an annual dividend payment to shareholders of $1.80 per share. Okay. So with that, I will turn it back over to Vince for our outlook for the third quarter of 2017, which again is on a combined company basis and excludes special items outlined in today’s release. Vincent Roche Thanks Ali. After a strong second quarter performance, we are planning for a continued sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter and for revenue to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion. By end market, we are planning for continued sequential revenue growth in industrial and for the communications end market to remain stable to the prior quarter. In automotive, we anticipate that seasonal trends would prevail, which would suggest a mid single-digit sequential decline in the third quarter. In the consumer market, we are planning for modest sequential revenue growth in the third quarter. We expect gross margins to be between 69% and 70% as we keep utilization levels stable to their second quarter rates and benefit from higher industrial revenue mix. We estimate that operating expenses will be between $430 million and $440 million. Notably, this translates into an operating margin range of 38% to 40% in the third quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.21. While we continue to see good business conditions, we are always pragmatic and cautious in how we manage our business and in how we convert our precious resources into free cash flow. On this point, with the combination complete, ADI’s free cash flow margin now ranks within the top 5% of the S&P 500. At our Investor Day on June 20, we will outline our plan to drive the long-term profitable growth for ADI, leveraging the customer value creation capabilities of our innovation and business diversity and our focus on best-in-class operational efficiencies to continue to drive our free cash flow to even higher levels. So with that, we are ready now to take your questions. Ali Husain Alright. Thanks Vince. So before we get to the Q&A session, just a couple of quick housekeeping items for me. So note that we will be hosting an Investor Day on June 20. It’s accessible via live webcast. I invite you all to tune in on June 20 to hear more about our long-term strategy and the new financial model for the company. And so let’s get to the Q&A session. We will try our best to get to all of our callers, so please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response we will give you an opportunity for a follow-up. So operator, can we have our first question, please. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava Hi, thank you very much for letting me ask questions. I had a medium-term question Ali and maybe you could answer that and then I had a longer term follow-up for Vince. So for the medium-term, could you please help us frame the consumer business, how – and when I say medium term, I am thinking how should we be thinking about this over the next 6 months to 18 months? And then I had a follow-up for Vince. Ali Husain Okay. Sure. Thanks Ambrish. Look I guess what I would tell you is our strategy in consumer is no different than our strategy in any of our markets. We focus on very tough problems that our customers have. We work to solve those for them. We try and create as much value as possible for our customers. And in turn that tends to generate a lot of free cash flow for ADI. I would say the only difference in consumer, relative to our other markets is that the product life cycles tend to be a little bit shorter. But apart from that, I would say the strategy at ADI is very, very consistent across all of our markets. Now you have seen that strategy play out over the last couple of years. We have grown our consumer business nicely. It’s generated a lot of free cash flow for the company. We have diversified our position in consumer both at our large customer. We have diversified our position across many other customers and into new vectors of growth that we think will drive consumer free cash flow and revenue growth over the long-term. All that being said, you know as well as I do that the consumer market tends to have shorter lifecycles. And so as a result, you can’t have periods of time where you have got some older designs that are rolling off and there is a bit of a pause between that happening and newer designs rolling on. My sense is that we are likely in one of those periods at the current time. I expect as a result, our mix of B2B markets to expand as a percentage of our revenue as we get into the back half of 2017. And I would expect that to continue into 2018 as well. I guess, the only other point I would make is just to provide a little bit more context, Ambrish, is we manage a very complex mix of portfolios and businesses at ADI. Each one of them have different lifecycles. Each one of them have different revenue growth profiles. Each one of them have different profitability profiles. But what I would tell you is as long as ADI is focusing on very tough solved problems to solve for our customers and we can drive a lot of free cash flow. And frankly, if we are meeting our hurdle rates and we can drive really good long-term profitable growth in free cash flow, we will play, because ultimately that’s the measure. Vince mentioned it in the prepared remarks we are now a top 5% S&P 500 free cash flow generator. And our goal is to drive that even higher from here. Operator Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First clarification, in terms of the revenue guide, was that combined or did that exclude old Linear? And then I guess as my main question just to follow-up on Ambrish’s question around consumer. Is that a business looking into calendar ‘17 and ‘18 that can grow given that you have brought on diversification increase to customer or is that something that we should be thinking about declining over the next 1, 2 years? Ali Husain Okay. So I think that was your first question and a follow-up. So, I think on the revenue side, we have provided combined company guidance for both companies and the range is $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion that would imply a midpoint of $1.41 billion. And I guess if you were just to think about how that flows by end markets, C.J., we expect the industrial market again had a very good second quarter. We expect that strength to continue into the third quarter. As a result, we are expecting industrial to grow somewhere in the low to mid single-digits sequentially in the third quarter, which again would be better than seasonal. Automotive, we are expecting a pretty seasonal quarter. So, as a result that would decline kind of in the mid single-digits sequentially. Communications is implied to be relatively stable. And on the consumer side, we are expecting modest sequential growth relative to the second quarter. And Vince, did you want to take the question about consumer implied growth in 2017 and 2018? Vincent Roche Yes. I think as Ali said, we experienced fundamentally shorter lifecycles in the consumer markets. And we have been working very, very hard over the last couple of years to diversify our product base and our customer base, the application base within consumer and we are making good progress of that. I think as we look into the third quarter, as Ali said, we are seeing modest sequential revenue growth, but nonetheless below what we would consider to be seasonal norms. So we are probably in a slower growth environment in the consumer business for the near-term here. Ali Husain And I’d say, C.J., if I could just add two points. One is we do expect as a result, our B2B markets to expand as a percentage of total revenue. And I think as you look into 2018, the accretion from the Linear Tech deal is very strong here in the third quarter, about 15%. And given some of the synergies that we have talked about, we expect that EPS accretion to accelerate into 2018 and I think that would be a very strong result. So, can we get to our next caller? Operator Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur Good morning. Congratulations on the strong results. Given the stronger industrial demand flow and outlook for continued growth, just wondering if you guys are seeing any component tightness or lead time stretching out? I know a few of your peers have highlighted some tightness. I am just – it sounds like you guys still have more room to grow on utilization, but wanted to get your views on the supply side situation? Ali Husain Thanks. Good question, Harlan, one that we obviously think about a lot as well. But I would tell you, we are delivering the vast majority of our products within our stated lead times of 4 to 6 weeks. That frankly hasn’t changed all that much over the last several quarters. I guess, what I would tell you is that ADI we are very focused on providing the highest levels of customer service and support and part of that service and support model is to deliver products when we tell our customers that we are going to deliver them. And so we tend to keep our lead times pretty short, 4 to 6 weeks delivering the vast majority of our products within those stated lead times. And I guess, I would also tell you that we are carrying 3.5 months worth of inventory in our balance sheet, which I think is a fair amount of inventory to help supply our customers with the products. The only one other point I perhaps make in this front is that if you recall back in 2016, we did bring our utilization rates down pretty hard. And the reason we did that is we wanted to manage our DSI or days of inventory down. And we managed the impact on gross margins by making permanent improvements in our cost structure. And I think as you now look out to 2017 and 2018, I think what investors should expect from ADI is a nice benefit on the drop-throughs, because as we are building the inventory, the drop-throughs are certainly better. But I guess, just coming back to your earlier point on the lead times, vast majority delivered within 4 to 6 weeks and we are keeping up high levels of service to our customers. Did you have a follow-up? Harlan Sur No, I’m good. Thank you. Ali Husain Okay. Operator Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach Yes, thank you. Question for Vince, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments around automotive with Linear Tech. And more specifically, can you talk about how expansive your opportunity set is, so if there is any examples of things that you think they will help you expand the content within automotive? Vincent Roche Yes. So automotive for us is a story of continuing content gain here for both LTC and for ADI. So, we see it as a key growth market for the combined companies. So I think we have talked before about ADI having great strength in emerging applications like, for example, 77-gigahertz radar, LIDAR infotainment with our A2B technology, for example, bringing new technologies into the powertrain, such as the rotationals and Linear sensing, magnetic devices. And as the powertrain electrifies being able to get our battery management technologies in there as well. So, I think both LTC and ADI have a lot of complimentary capability, for example, to the ADI signal chains that I have just talked about here, we are adding LTC power management capability. And the outcome of that is we can architect an optimized solution for each of the sub-applications here for the automotive customers. And there is great complementarity between the signal chain and the power chain. So I think that’s looking very, very good. And also, there is a lot of new power management things that we are looking at independent of signal chains that LT will be instrumental in helping us nail down over the coming few years. So, there is a tremendous amount of benefit in coupling power management with the signal chain. And every single application which we play within the transportation automotive sector requires both signal chain and power management. And what I am seeing so far is the tremendous level of collaboration between the applications teams, the design teams and really grabbing the opportunities here with both hands. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Craig. Did you have a follow-up? Craig Hettenbach Yes. I guess just a brief one, just on the integration, good to hear that it’s on track and kind of good start out of the gate. Just any comments in terms of culture, key people and kind of milestones we should be aware of? Vincent Roche Well, we have known that LT is a very, very high-quality company. And I have been obviously hands on involved in the integration of the two companies. I am very, very impressed by the quality of the people throughout LT and I am also very impressed with just how fast both companies are coming together to create something better than the sum of the parts. So right now, we are laser focused on leveraging the combined strengths of both companies to generate this long-term profitable growth possibility that we know is there. And we are taking our time to really figure out – we have been very, very patient at figuring out how to combine the leadership – we have combined the leadership teams, but we have been very patient in trying to figure out what the best of both really means here. So I think to answer your question, very directly here Craig, we are culturally I think in good shape. Our values as I have talked about many times before, the values around technology and business and customer are very, very similar. And in creating this best of both, we are actually leveraging the differences in the way the operating routines of both companies to draw from, to create something greater than some of the parts. So we are focused as I said on delighting our customers, ensuring that we are capturing the upside demand here. And I think overall the – once the values are compatible, as I said I am using the cultural differences to create something greater than the sum of the parts. And the LT leadership is playing a key role. I have got two members of the senior LTC staff and my staff. And the LT leaders are contributing to this new company multiple levels down at this point in time. Craig Hettenbach Great. Thanks. Ali Husain Thank you. We will get to our next caller. Operator And our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Vincent Roche You are back, good. Ambrish Srivastava Hi. Thank you. I had my follow-up keyed up. For some reason I got dropped off. Thanks for accommodating me back. I wanted to get back to the capital allocation and the free cash flow, it seems like the free cash flow generating ability might be higher than at least what our models were suggesting. So could you please remind us just in terms of capital allocation and the timing for the pay down, obviously the leverage ratio was lower than what you had communicated and what it was at the deal close, so any light on that would be very helpful? Thank you. Ali Husain Okay, fair enough. I will leave the key take away for next month when we present to you at the Analyst Day, because I think we want to save a little bit of dry powder for that. But what I would tell you is since we announced the acquisition, there is a couple of things. One is we set out this target of 3.8x net debt to EBITDA. And then a typical ADI fashion, we put out targets and we had executed extremely aggressively against those targets. And part of it is just coming out at a lower leverage ratio is just a function of the mindset at ADIs. We execute extremely aggressively against the targets that we lay out. Part of it is like business conditions have been better and as a result, we have generated more cash flow. And part of it frankly is just having a laser focus on operational efficiencies. And so that’s driven a lot of good cash flow as well. The good news I guess from a leverage perspective as we have talked about is we are certainly well ahead of schedule in terms of the de-leveraging plan. The bogie we are shooting for is 2x net debt to EBITDA and I would say we are probably ahead of schedule in trying to hit that number. Once we get to that number, I think we have been pretty public in terms of saying, look we are going to turn the share buyback program back on. In the meanwhile the dividend remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation strategy. And then the only other last point I would make is and again this kind of supports the notion of that we are ahead of schedule is after the quarter ended, we did pay $200 million down on the $5 billion term loan balance. So I think we are certainly ahead of schedule and in very good shape on that front. Ambrish Srivastava Okay. Thank you very much. Ali Husain Okay, great. Operator Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. So the industrial market is growing very strongly, I believe you mentioned 20% year-over-year, how much of that is the market coming back versus perhaps more electronic content or even some share gains? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. I think it’s true to say that first off we are recovering from a relatively weak environment in the prior year. So the compare is kind of easy from that perspective. From everything that we can tell right now, the growth is broad based across all the industrial sectors and in fact across all the geographies as well. And I think that’s just a function of the better business environment versus last year overall. And if you just paying attention to our own customers as well, they are all guiding for low to high single-digit growth in 2017. As a company, several years ago, we made a strategic pivot in terms of where we placed our R&D, putting more into B2B applications. And industrial has been a great beneficiary of that. So I think just given the cycles in the industrial sector in general, we are beginning to see some of those products really contribute in a meaningful way across factory and process automation, aerospace and defense, the instrumentation ATE business. And so I think the business environment is overall better, but we are also doing better in terms of grabbing share through the effects of our new product investments over the last several years. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. Vince, you also mentioned earlier that you plan to leverage Linear Technology into the wireless infrastructure market, I was just hoping you could elaborate just a little bit more on that because certainly, that’s a market that’s been weaker the last 2 years, but I assume with 5G coming on, your plan is to leverage both entities to participate in that market? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. Well, we are – as ADI organic, we have been doing better and better in terms of building solutions for our customers from antenna right down to bits, leveraging the strength of ADI and Hittite combined. And we know that as customers put greater and greater pressure on for more integration, to be able to solve the noise problems more effectively in these radio systems, that power management is going to be a great help to us. And already, I think in the shorter term, we are being actively engaged in discussions to use existing products with ADI solutions, for example, in the transceiver space, in 5G systems, leveraging LTE’s power technology. And that’s only the beginning because over the coming generations when we can start to architect the radio solutions now with the new advances in power management technology that LT has been making, I think we can have several generations here of success in both the wired and the wireless business in the years ahead. And there is no doubt there is tremendous symbiosis between the signal chain technologies that ADI has been so strong in over the years with the power technologies that LT now brings to the table. So the conversations with our customers are very active and with existing products and we are now plotting the next new architectures based on the combination of the two companies. Tore Svanberg Alright. Thank you. Ali Husain Thank you very much. Next question please. Operator Your next question is from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks for taking my question. I am hoping you can expand on something you touched on earlier, the cultural differences, however may be they are not as great as some people perceive, but I think one of them is that Linear was known for having an intense focus on gross profit margin and perhaps that limited that business’ revenue growth and I think ADI has a more growthy sort of outlook. So I am wondering if you can sort of highlight any initial opportunities to expand the growth rate on the Linear business? Vincent Roche Yes. It’s a good question. It’s true that both companies have had very, very strong focus on gross margin. I think it’s a great kind of proxy for the quality of the innovation that you are developing, the price you can command and ultimately, the gross margins that you can get. So what I will say is that ADI has probably just – given our buying power, their operational focus. We have combined now with LT we have got more buying power. So we can be more flexible in terms of taking some market share with products already available without sacrificing the margins, just giving the signings of the so called bill of materials that we are now sourcing across both companies. So we don’t intend to drop our standards, but we do intend to be aggressive in terms of leveraging all the available products and technologies that we have to grow our business profitably. I think that’s the way to think about it. Ali Husain And did you have any follow-up, Will? William Stein I did. One of the issues from the integration that’s always important in any of these transactions is ERP, and by the disclosure around end markets that sort of lumps the Linear Tech revenue in its own category maybe a sign that perhaps that’s going to take a bit of time to reflect their revenue across your end markets. Any guidance or commentary as to when we should see that disclosed sort of on a combined basis and just in general the update on that aspect of the integration? Ali Husain Yes, fair enough. I can take part of that. Look, from an ERP’s perspective and frankly from an integration perspective, we are generally keeping Linear Tech on a standalone basis for the first year. And then we will converge. With regards specifically to the end market question, we actually have the data. I just didn’t feel like it was that meaningful for a stub quarter and I can certainly talk to it right now in the call. But you should expect from ADI next quarter that we have all of the disclosures by end markets mapped out and that’s absolutely no issue to do. What I would tell you in the quarter, had Linear been part of ADI for a full quarter, they would have seen their industrial business grow and they would have seen their automotive business decrease sequentially given their exposure to the powertrain market, specifically in transportation in China, which has been a weaker market. But the good news there I’d say well is that, that market is actually pretty stable right now and that gives us a fair amount of confidence guiding into the third quarter, then automotive will be pretty seasonal. William Stein Great. Thank you. Ali Husain Yes, no problem. Next question please. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Chris Danely Hey, thanks, guys. Congratulations on the good quarter and good guidance. Now that Linear is kind of lumped into the mix, how, if you could, frame the October quarter for the combined company just in terms of where combined OpEx could go? Could it go down again? And then also what should we expect for seasonality for revenue for the combined company for the October quarter? Ali Husain Yes. Okay, so let me try and parse that out a little bit and may be Vince can help me as well. But look from a – Chris, we have absolutely no visibility into the fourth quarter, the October quarter at this stage. So in the absence of any orders, all I can rely on is what seasonal trends tend to do and seasonally speaking industrial tends to be a little weaker in the fourth quarter. Automotive generally increases. Communications is always a wildcard just frankly depending on how the builds and the deployments are going. And then consumer generally has a pretty good growth quarter sequentially, because you start to see more of the builds taking place. So, that’s all I can tell you today, with absolutely zero visibility into the fourth quarter. What I would tell you on the OpEx side and I’d say it’s a fair point is on a standalone basis this quarter ADI had OpEx of $318 million. Linear Tech contributed $62 million in the quarter. I guess I would caution you on that number. One is obviously it’s a stub period and so it’s a partial quarter. And number two, there were public company costs that did come out of that number, which we have always talked about public company costs being somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million annually. And so the quarterly run-rate that we have guided to for operating expenses in the third quarter of $430 million to $440 million already includes those synergies embedded. Now to your other point, there are more synergies on the comp. We will start to see some of them. It will be very back end loaded there, Chris in the third quarter, but you will start to see more of them play out in the fourth quarter. And I would expect them to be then pretty linear back into the fourth quarter of 2018. If you recall, we have always talked about $100 million of OpEx synergies achieving that run-rate by the fourth quarter of 2018. I guess, what I am saying is $20 million of that is now baked into the third quarter run-rate number and there is still another $80 million to come, again on an annualized number as we go into the fourth quarter of 2018. Chris Danely Great. Do I get a follow-up? Ali Husain Of course. Chris Danely Thanks. Any update on the CFO – new CFO? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, let me tell you, Chris, we have – obviously we have retained a search firm. And what I can tell you is that we are making excellent progress right now. My expectation is that we will have the replacement named by the end of the fiscal year at the latest. But I am quite optimistic that we will be able to announce something quite well before then. So in the interim, I am taking a very hands-on approach with the integration of LT. And I am also relying with a terrific bench of people at ADI across all the facets of the management of the finance function of ADI. So, we can – we are very, very well positioned to ensure that we hit our targets in terms of the ongoing operation as well as the synergies. So, synergies are on track and we will update you on where we are at the Investor Day in the latter part of June here. Chris Danely Great. Thanks, guys. Ali Husain Thanks, Chris. Next caller, please. Operator Your next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani Thanks a lot. I guess just a question on the Linear side you have had this under your belt for a few months now. So I am curious when it comes to revenue synergies, where are you guys more focused on to drive revenue synergies, because I would imagine consumer might be the easiest place to get it or the quickest place to get it, but perhaps not the most ideal one for you. So, how do you think about the end markets and revenue synergies as you go forward? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, I think as we have talked about earlier on, the various markets, all of different cycles in terms of uptake, design cycles and adoption cycles. But I think obviously every sector in which we play, including consumer, has an opportunity for ADI to draw Linear Technology power management for additional revenue opportunity and growth. I would say it’s a medium-term to see the effect anyway of leveraging existing products and getting any meaningful revenue growth from those products is probably a 2 to 3-year proposition as we have experienced as well with Hittite. But I think the areas that we will see meaningful growth in the medium-term here will be automotive for sure. I think the communications sector will see a good uptick in the medium-term. Very judiciously as well, we are looking at some consumer opportunities. So obviously, those hit probably sooner than any other sector of the portfolio we manage. And I think industrial is 3 years plus from here. So I think that’s the way to think about the adoption of existing products and new sockets and the effect that we should see on revenue growth here. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Amit Daryanani I do, sir. I guess your consumer guide for July, modest sequential growth. I think last couple of years it’s been triple-digitish kind of number in the July quarter. The delta, do you think it’s due to later product launches in that segment or a change in the content that you guys have or maybe the OEMs that have more comfort around your ability around these products of asking you to do it a little bit later? It seems to be a fairly big delta, which we have seen the last 2 years at least. So, perhaps help us explain what’s driving that? Ali Husain Yes. So, I guess I will take that. I think we answered the question earlier in the call. I think this is definitely something that is, I would say more related to ADI. And we just have our content in various products are very much SKU dependent and we just think we will have a different kind of a mix this year relative to previous years. But I’d say as we progress into 2018, my expectation is that our B2B mix – our B2B markets expand as a percentage of total revenue as a result. Amit Daryanani Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter guys. Vincent Roche Thank you. Operator Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on your execution as you get started in the new area with Linear Tech. My question is regarding the synergies for the combined company. It’s clear, Vincent, that the company is quite happy with the way the early combined work is going. The question is does the progress on synergies thus far cause you to think differently about the linearity with which you expect to realize the $150 million in cost gains from the two companies? Vincent Roche No. I think when we have talked about synergies, we have been very clear that we have acquired LT for all its capabilities in terms of technology and customer management channel, channel management, operations and so on to drive revenue synergy over the long-term. But no, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, I am very pleased with the progress that we are making. We have – we had actually executed a lot of the decisions on the $150 million of synergies in advance of combining the companies. And the synergies are well-identified and the actions are in place to get the synergies executed. So my sense is it will take us, during the coming year, to really see the effects of the synergies in our P&L from a cost perspective. And a little bit longer than that I think as I have just been talking about to get the synergies from the cross-selling opportunities. Ali Husain Right, Craig, another follow-up? Craig Ellis Yes. Thanks for that Ali. And I follow-up on an end market, communications Vincent, I think you have mentioned 5G a couple of times and it seems like relative to 4G, the bigger picture is that, that seems to be more on track or maybe pulling in a little bit earlier versus what we had seen with some of the prior interface changes, but with regard to that opportunity, when would ADI expect 5G related infrastructure revenues to start to become a material part of its communications segment? Thank you. Vincent Roche I think your point is well taken. I think originally when we began talking about 5G, we were talking about it being a facet of our business in kind of 2020-plus. It now seems that we are obviously in trials right now with 5G, all the major application areas, all the major customers globally. So my own sense is that we will begin to see, I think a meaningful ramp in revenue in the 2019 kind of area. Maybe it’s a little sooner, maybe it’s a little later, but that’s my sense at this point in time that there is an aggressive pull in at the carrier level as well as the OEMs to make faster progress in deploying 5G. Ali Husain Alright. Craig, thank you. And we will get through our next caller. Operator Your next question is from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra Hi, good morning. You had mentioned that you recently that you have seen the small cell business finally picking up, what’s your market share in that business, which I am assuming has been fairly small and what type of growth are we looking and what type of revenue contribution can we get in the next say – in the next 12 months to 18 months? Ali Husain Yes. Hi Tristan, let me try and take a crack at that. I am sure Vince would be much more eloquent than I could ever be. But in any event, I would say on the small cell side, it’s been a relatively small contributor to our growth. I guess what we are particularly proud of are our integrated transceiver solutions that are picking up content both on macro base stations and in small cell base stations. So to be perfectly candid with you, we are pretty agnostic as to where these platforms end up. What is really important for ADI is the channel count. And so as long as you got more and more things that are connecting up, we tend to do extremely well when that happens. And so that could be a small cell, that could be a macro base station, but we are doing extremely well in the marketplace. We had another record quarter on top of our record quarter in the prior quarter in our integrated transceiver solutions that are just sucking up a lot of bill of materials and allowing us to gain share in this market. So interestingly you saw our results this quarter. And again it speaks to the diversity of our communications infrastructure market and our business. But our sequential revenue growth was led by wireless infrastructure and our year-over-year growth was led by wireline infrastructure. So you can see the diversity there. The other point I would make is with the addition of Linear Tech, our communications infrastructure business is more diversified than ever. In the past, about two-thirds of our calls business was wireless. At the current time, it’s more like 50-50. So I think we have the full suite of technology and we are pretty agnostic as to form factor. We have got the products and I think really it’s a question of as the market percolates, we are going to do extremely well. Vincent Roche Yes. I think just to add a little bit of color to what Ali has said, small cell is still a small activity from a market perspective. We are very, very well positioned. And I think it will start to accelerate so much during the course of the next 12 months to 18 months and become a more meaningful part of the overall wireless story in communications infrastructure. Ali Husain Alright. So you answered it better than I would. Thanks Tristan, do you have a follow-up? Tristan Gerra Yes, if I could. And thanks for the very useful answer. It looks like your Hittite business has grown fairly significantly since the close, could you provide some color on what’s been driving that growth, has it been share gain, new products or just distribution synergies and the question really relates to how should we look at Linear Tech in terms of the experience that you have gained with Hittite and the revenue growth achievement that you have done with Hittite? Vincent Roche Okay. Well, let me try and unpack. There were a couple of key questions there. I think with Hittite, we knew that the technology was very, very strong. And ADI, one of the big synergies we got from acquiring Hittite was just the channel reach, the customer reach and the channel reach that ADI had, that Hittite didn’t have. So we have been able to leverage that to tremendous effect. We knew that the portfolio products, was very, very strong. So, that’s been a huge help to us. Obviously, we have been able to architect. We have been together now almost 3 years and we have been able to architect some really new creative solutions in areas like aerospace and defense, phased array antenna, for example, these new radar systems that are being deployed as radar systems digitize across the globe. Even in instrumentation where a lot of the high-frequency systems require the combination of mix signal and microwave technology. Obviously, in the automotive sector where all these microwave technologies are being deployed, we are having the combination of ADI and Hittite there has been really, really powerful. So, I think it’s – it was a case of a lot of products that needed a new channel and a lot of re-architecting of customer systems based upon ADI’s signal processing mix signal strength and Hittite’s microwave strength. So what was the second part of that question? Ali Husain How would you leverage that to Linear? Vincent Roche So, leverage to Linear, I think the approach we have on the best of both was also true with Hittite. We tried to figure out how to be patient, understand the world class capabilities that Hittite had in terms of people and technology. And we have taken the very same approach with LTC. LTC is obviously a world class company as well. So just being patient, listening to create something greater than sum of the parts, build a whole new operating system across the company for speed and simplification. That’s what we did with Hittite and that’s what we are doing with LTC x5. Ali Husain Great. Thanks for the question. And we are zooming into the 11 o’clock hour here, so we are going to do our best to get to everybody. In case we can’t, feel free to call our Investor Relations phone at 781-461-3282. So we will continue until 11:00. Next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. You talked a bit about the trajectory of synergies on OpEx. What about on the $15 million in COGS? Can you give us fueling for how much of that, if any, is embedded in the Q3 guidance or where might we see that by the end of the year and should we expect a different trajectory of capturing those gross margin synergies versus what you are suggesting we should think about for the OpEx side? Ali Husain Yes, I know I’d say on the gross margin side, we are very early in the process. I’d say those are all very much on the comp. I wouldn’t expect to see those in Q3 or Q4 this year. Did you have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon I did. On the OpEx or just on the cost synergies, in general, it doesn’t sound like you are quite ready to take the target up. But can you give us a feeling given how far you are in the planning phase and which areas have proved maybe easier than you might have thought initially as well as more difficult? And if we were looking for potential upside, where do you think it might be easiest to squeeze more out? Vincent Roche Well, clearly we have been able to reduce the public company cost of the combined company. That’s one of the things that’s been executed pretty much straight away. I think we had talked before as well about an early retirement program that we had put in place at ADI and we begin to see the benefits of that fettering in over the next couple of quarters. But the – and obviously, distribution channel optimization as well that we had talked about before that will start to show benefits to us, I think towards the back end of this year and the early part of the coming year. So, there are just three or four examples of the things that we have already got in play that we will start to see the benefit of. And all the other synergies are identified. And we have got the actions in place and we are now just ready to realize them. Ali Husain Yes. And Stacy, I will just add we have talked about it before, but the EPS accretion in the third quarter is expected to be 15%. And I think if you start baking some of these synergies in the 2018, I think you get a number well north of that. So, we look forward to updating you on the model and any potential updates on the synergy target next month at the Analyst Meeting. Alright. I think we just hit the 11 o’clock hour. So listen, thank you everybody for joining us this morning. A copy of this transcript will be available on our website and all available reconciliations and additional information can also be found on the Quarterly Results section of our Investor Relations site at investor.analog.com.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava Hi, thank you very much for letting me ask questions. I had a medium-term question Ali and maybe you could answer that and then I had a longer term follow-up for Vince. So for the medium-term, could you please help us frame the consumer business, how – and when I say medium term, I am thinking how should we be thinking about this over the next 6 months to 18 months? And then I had a follow-up for Vince. Ali Husain Okay. Sure. Thanks Ambrish. Look I guess what I would tell you is our strategy in consumer is no different than our strategy in any of our markets. We focus on very tough problems that our customers have. We work to solve those for them. We try and create as much value as possible for our customers. And in turn that tends to generate a lot of free cash flow for ADI. I would say the only difference in consumer, relative to our other markets is that the product life cycles tend to be a little bit shorter. But apart from that, I would say the strategy at ADI is very, very consistent across all of our markets. Now you have seen that strategy play out over the last couple of years. We have grown our consumer business nicely. It’s generated a lot of free cash flow for the company. We have diversified our position in consumer both at our large customer. We have diversified our position across many other customers and into new vectors of growth that we think will drive consumer free cash flow and revenue growth over the long-term. All that being said, you know as well as I do that the consumer market tends to have shorter lifecycles. And so as a result, you can’t have periods of time where you have got some older designs that are rolling off and there is a bit of a pause between that happening and newer designs rolling on. My sense is that we are likely in one of those periods at the current time. I expect as a result, our mix of B2B markets to expand as a percentage of our revenue as we get into the back half of 2017. And I would expect that to continue into 2018 as well. I guess, the only other point I would make is just to provide a little bit more context, Ambrish, is we manage a very complex mix of portfolios and businesses at ADI. Each one of them have different lifecycles. Each one of them have different revenue growth profiles. Each one of them have different profitability profiles. But what I would tell you is as long as ADI is focusing on very tough solved problems to solve for our customers and we can drive a lot of free cash flow. And frankly, if we are meeting our hurdle rates and we can drive really good long-term profitable growth in free cash flow, we will play, because ultimately that’s the measure. Vince mentioned it in the prepared remarks we are now a top 5% S&P 500 free cash flow generator. And our goal is to drive that even higher from here. Operator Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First clarification, in terms of the revenue guide, was that combined or did that exclude old Linear? And then I guess as my main question just to follow-up on Ambrish’s question around consumer. Is that a business looking into calendar ‘17 and ‘18 that can grow given that you have brought on diversification increase to customer or is that something that we should be thinking about declining over the next 1, 2 years? Ali Husain Okay. So I think that was your first question and a follow-up. So, I think on the revenue side, we have provided combined company guidance for both companies and the range is $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion that would imply a midpoint of $1.41 billion. And I guess if you were just to think about how that flows by end markets, C.J., we expect the industrial market again had a very good second quarter. We expect that strength to continue into the third quarter. As a result, we are expecting industrial to grow somewhere in the low to mid single-digits sequentially in the third quarter, which again would be better than seasonal. Automotive, we are expecting a pretty seasonal quarter. So, as a result that would decline kind of in the mid single-digits sequentially. Communications is implied to be relatively stable. And on the consumer side, we are expecting modest sequential growth relative to the second quarter. And Vince, did you want to take the question about consumer implied growth in 2017 and 2018? Vincent Roche Yes. I think as Ali said, we experienced fundamentally shorter lifecycles in the consumer markets. And we have been working very, very hard over the last couple of years to diversify our product base and our customer base, the application base within consumer and we are making good progress of that. I think as we look into the third quarter, as Ali said, we are seeing modest sequential revenue growth, but nonetheless below what we would consider to be seasonal norms. So we are probably in a slower growth environment in the consumer business for the near-term here. Ali Husain And I’d say, C.J., if I could just add two points. One is we do expect as a result, our B2B markets to expand as a percentage of total revenue. And I think as you look into 2018, the accretion from the Linear Tech deal is very strong here in the third quarter, about 15%. And given some of the synergies that we have talked about, we expect that EPS accretion to accelerate into 2018 and I think that would be a very strong result. So, can we get to our next caller? Operator Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur Good morning. Congratulations on the strong results. Given the stronger industrial demand flow and outlook for continued growth, just wondering if you guys are seeing any component tightness or lead time stretching out? I know a few of your peers have highlighted some tightness. I am just – it sounds like you guys still have more room to grow on utilization, but wanted to get your views on the supply side situation? Ali Husain Thanks. Good question, Harlan, one that we obviously think about a lot as well. But I would tell you, we are delivering the vast majority of our products within our stated lead times of 4 to 6 weeks. That frankly hasn’t changed all that much over the last several quarters. I guess, what I would tell you is that ADI we are very focused on providing the highest levels of customer service and support and part of that service and support model is to deliver products when we tell our customers that we are going to deliver them. And so we tend to keep our lead times pretty short, 4 to 6 weeks delivering the vast majority of our products within those stated lead times. And I guess, I would also tell you that we are carrying 3.5 months worth of inventory in our balance sheet, which I think is a fair amount of inventory to help supply our customers with the products. The only one other point I perhaps make in this front is that if you recall back in 2016, we did bring our utilization rates down pretty hard. And the reason we did that is we wanted to manage our DSI or days of inventory down. And we managed the impact on gross margins by making permanent improvements in our cost structure. And I think as you now look out to 2017 and 2018, I think what investors should expect from ADI is a nice benefit on the drop-throughs, because as we are building the inventory, the drop-throughs are certainly better. But I guess, just coming back to your earlier point on the lead times, vast majority delivered within 4 to 6 weeks and we are keeping up high levels of service to our customers. Did you have a follow-up? Harlan Sur No, I’m good. Thank you. Ali Husain Okay. Operator Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach Yes, thank you. Question for Vince, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments around automotive with Linear Tech. And more specifically, can you talk about how expansive your opportunity set is, so if there is any examples of things that you think they will help you expand the content within automotive? Vincent Roche Yes. So automotive for us is a story of continuing content gain here for both LTC and for ADI. So, we see it as a key growth market for the combined companies. So I think we have talked before about ADI having great strength in emerging applications like, for example, 77-gigahertz radar, LIDAR infotainment with our A2B technology, for example, bringing new technologies into the powertrain, such as the rotationals and Linear sensing, magnetic devices. And as the powertrain electrifies being able to get our battery management technologies in there as well. So, I think both LTC and ADI have a lot of complimentary capability, for example, to the ADI signal chains that I have just talked about here, we are adding LTC power management capability. And the outcome of that is we can architect an optimized solution for each of the sub-applications here for the automotive customers. And there is great complementarity between the signal chain and the power chain. So I think that’s looking very, very good. And also, there is a lot of new power management things that we are looking at independent of signal chains that LT will be instrumental in helping us nail down over the coming few years. So, there is a tremendous amount of benefit in coupling power management with the signal chain. And every single application which we play within the transportation automotive sector requires both signal chain and power management. And what I am seeing so far is the tremendous level of collaboration between the applications teams, the design teams and really grabbing the opportunities here with both hands. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Craig. Did you have a follow-up? Craig Hettenbach Yes. I guess just a brief one, just on the integration, good to hear that it’s on track and kind of good start out of the gate. Just any comments in terms of culture, key people and kind of milestones we should be aware of? Vincent Roche Well, we have known that LT is a very, very high-quality company. And I have been obviously hands on involved in the integration of the two companies. I am very, very impressed by the quality of the people throughout LT and I am also very impressed with just how fast both companies are coming together to create something better than the sum of the parts. So right now, we are laser focused on leveraging the combined strengths of both companies to generate this long-term profitable growth possibility that we know is there. And we are taking our time to really figure out – we have been very, very patient at figuring out how to combine the leadership – we have combined the leadership teams, but we have been very patient in trying to figure out what the best of both really means here. So I think to answer your question, very directly here Craig, we are culturally I think in good shape. Our values as I have talked about many times before, the values around technology and business and customer are very, very similar. And in creating this best of both, we are actually leveraging the differences in the way the operating routines of both companies to draw from, to create something greater than some of the parts. So we are focused as I said on delighting our customers, ensuring that we are capturing the upside demand here. And I think overall the – once the values are compatible, as I said I am using the cultural differences to create something greater than the sum of the parts. And the LT leadership is playing a key role. I have got two members of the senior LTC staff and my staff. And the LT leaders are contributing to this new company multiple levels down at this point in time. Craig Hettenbach Great. Thanks. Ali Husain Thank you. We will get to our next caller. Operator And our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Vincent Roche You are back, good. Ambrish Srivastava Hi. Thank you. I had my follow-up keyed up. For some reason I got dropped off. Thanks for accommodating me back. I wanted to get back to the capital allocation and the free cash flow, it seems like the free cash flow generating ability might be higher than at least what our models were suggesting. So could you please remind us just in terms of capital allocation and the timing for the pay down, obviously the leverage ratio was lower than what you had communicated and what it was at the deal close, so any light on that would be very helpful? Thank you. Ali Husain Okay, fair enough. I will leave the key take away for next month when we present to you at the Analyst Day, because I think we want to save a little bit of dry powder for that. But what I would tell you is since we announced the acquisition, there is a couple of things. One is we set out this target of 3.8x net debt to EBITDA. And then a typical ADI fashion, we put out targets and we had executed extremely aggressively against those targets. And part of it is just coming out at a lower leverage ratio is just a function of the mindset at ADIs. We execute extremely aggressively against the targets that we lay out. Part of it is like business conditions have been better and as a result, we have generated more cash flow. And part of it frankly is just having a laser focus on operational efficiencies. And so that’s driven a lot of good cash flow as well. The good news I guess from a leverage perspective as we have talked about is we are certainly well ahead of schedule in terms of the de-leveraging plan. The bogie we are shooting for is 2x net debt to EBITDA and I would say we are probably ahead of schedule in trying to hit that number. Once we get to that number, I think we have been pretty public in terms of saying, look we are going to turn the share buyback program back on. In the meanwhile the dividend remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation strategy. And then the only other last point I would make is and again this kind of supports the notion of that we are ahead of schedule is after the quarter ended, we did pay $200 million down on the $5 billion term loan balance. So I think we are certainly ahead of schedule and in very good shape on that front. Ambrish Srivastava Okay. Thank you very much. Ali Husain Okay, great. Operator Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. So the industrial market is growing very strongly, I believe you mentioned 20% year-over-year, how much of that is the market coming back versus perhaps more electronic content or even some share gains? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. I think it’s true to say that first off we are recovering from a relatively weak environment in the prior year. So the compare is kind of easy from that perspective. From everything that we can tell right now, the growth is broad based across all the industrial sectors and in fact across all the geographies as well. And I think that’s just a function of the better business environment versus last year overall. And if you just paying attention to our own customers as well, they are all guiding for low to high single-digit growth in 2017. As a company, several years ago, we made a strategic pivot in terms of where we placed our R&D, putting more into B2B applications. And industrial has been a great beneficiary of that. So I think just given the cycles in the industrial sector in general, we are beginning to see some of those products really contribute in a meaningful way across factory and process automation, aerospace and defense, the instrumentation ATE business. And so I think the business environment is overall better, but we are also doing better in terms of grabbing share through the effects of our new product investments over the last several years. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. Vince, you also mentioned earlier that you plan to leverage Linear Technology into the wireless infrastructure market, I was just hoping you could elaborate just a little bit more on that because certainly, that’s a market that’s been weaker the last 2 years, but I assume with 5G coming on, your plan is to leverage both entities to participate in that market? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. Well, we are – as ADI organic, we have been doing better and better in terms of building solutions for our customers from antenna right down to bits, leveraging the strength of ADI and Hittite combined. And we know that as customers put greater and greater pressure on for more integration, to be able to solve the noise problems more effectively in these radio systems, that power management is going to be a great help to us. And already, I think in the shorter term, we are being actively engaged in discussions to use existing products with ADI solutions, for example, in the transceiver space, in 5G systems, leveraging LTE’s power technology. And that’s only the beginning because over the coming generations when we can start to architect the radio solutions now with the new advances in power management technology that LT has been making, I think we can have several generations here of success in both the wired and the wireless business in the years ahead. And there is no doubt there is tremendous symbiosis between the signal chain technologies that ADI has been so strong in over the years with the power technologies that LT now brings to the table. So the conversations with our customers are very active and with existing products and we are now plotting the next new architectures based on the combination of the two companies. Tore Svanberg Alright. Thank you. Ali Husain Thank you very much. Next question please. Operator Your next question is from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks for taking my question. I am hoping you can expand on something you touched on earlier, the cultural differences, however may be they are not as great as some people perceive, but I think one of them is that Linear was known for having an intense focus on gross profit margin and perhaps that limited that business’ revenue growth and I think ADI has a more growthy sort of outlook. So I am wondering if you can sort of highlight any initial opportunities to expand the growth rate on the Linear business? Vincent Roche Yes. It’s a good question. It’s true that both companies have had very, very strong focus on gross margin. I think it’s a great kind of proxy for the quality of the innovation that you are developing, the price you can command and ultimately, the gross margins that you can get. So what I will say is that ADI has probably just – given our buying power, their operational focus. We have combined now with LT we have got more buying power. So we can be more flexible in terms of taking some market share with products already available without sacrificing the margins, just giving the signings of the so called bill of materials that we are now sourcing across both companies. So we don’t intend to drop our standards, but we do intend to be aggressive in terms of leveraging all the available products and technologies that we have to grow our business profitably. I think that’s the way to think about it. Ali Husain And did you have any follow-up, Will? William Stein I did. One of the issues from the integration that’s always important in any of these transactions is ERP, and by the disclosure around end markets that sort of lumps the Linear Tech revenue in its own category maybe a sign that perhaps that’s going to take a bit of time to reflect their revenue across your end markets. Any guidance or commentary as to when we should see that disclosed sort of on a combined basis and just in general the update on that aspect of the integration? Ali Husain Yes, fair enough. I can take part of that. Look, from an ERP’s perspective and frankly from an integration perspective, we are generally keeping Linear Tech on a standalone basis for the first year. And then we will converge. With regards specifically to the end market question, we actually have the data. I just didn’t feel like it was that meaningful for a stub quarter and I can certainly talk to it right now in the call. But you should expect from ADI next quarter that we have all of the disclosures by end markets mapped out and that’s absolutely no issue to do. What I would tell you in the quarter, had Linear been part of ADI for a full quarter, they would have seen their industrial business grow and they would have seen their automotive business decrease sequentially given their exposure to the powertrain market, specifically in transportation in China, which has been a weaker market. But the good news there I’d say well is that, that market is actually pretty stable right now and that gives us a fair amount of confidence guiding into the third quarter, then automotive will be pretty seasonal. William Stein Great. Thank you. Ali Husain Yes, no problem. Next question please. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Chris Danely Hey, thanks, guys. Congratulations on the good quarter and good guidance. Now that Linear is kind of lumped into the mix, how, if you could, frame the October quarter for the combined company just in terms of where combined OpEx could go? Could it go down again? And then also what should we expect for seasonality for revenue for the combined company for the October quarter? Ali Husain Yes. Okay, so let me try and parse that out a little bit and may be Vince can help me as well. But look from a – Chris, we have absolutely no visibility into the fourth quarter, the October quarter at this stage. So in the absence of any orders, all I can rely on is what seasonal trends tend to do and seasonally speaking industrial tends to be a little weaker in the fourth quarter. Automotive generally increases. Communications is always a wildcard just frankly depending on how the builds and the deployments are going. And then consumer generally has a pretty good growth quarter sequentially, because you start to see more of the builds taking place. So, that’s all I can tell you today, with absolutely zero visibility into the fourth quarter. What I would tell you on the OpEx side and I’d say it’s a fair point is on a standalone basis this quarter ADI had OpEx of $318 million. Linear Tech contributed $62 million in the quarter. I guess I would caution you on that number. One is obviously it’s a stub period and so it’s a partial quarter. And number two, there were public company costs that did come out of that number, which we have always talked about public company costs being somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million annually. And so the quarterly run-rate that we have guided to for operating expenses in the third quarter of $430 million to $440 million already includes those synergies embedded. Now to your other point, there are more synergies on the comp. We will start to see some of them. It will be very back end loaded there, Chris in the third quarter, but you will start to see more of them play out in the fourth quarter. And I would expect them to be then pretty linear back into the fourth quarter of 2018. If you recall, we have always talked about $100 million of OpEx synergies achieving that run-rate by the fourth quarter of 2018. I guess, what I am saying is $20 million of that is now baked into the third quarter run-rate number and there is still another $80 million to come, again on an annualized number as we go into the fourth quarter of 2018. Chris Danely Great. Do I get a follow-up? Ali Husain Of course. Chris Danely Thanks. Any update on the CFO – new CFO? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, let me tell you, Chris, we have – obviously we have retained a search firm. And what I can tell you is that we are making excellent progress right now. My expectation is that we will have the replacement named by the end of the fiscal year at the latest. But I am quite optimistic that we will be able to announce something quite well before then. So in the interim, I am taking a very hands-on approach with the integration of LT. And I am also relying with a terrific bench of people at ADI across all the facets of the management of the finance function of ADI. So, we can – we are very, very well positioned to ensure that we hit our targets in terms of the ongoing operation as well as the synergies. So, synergies are on track and we will update you on where we are at the Investor Day in the latter part of June here. Chris Danely Great. Thanks, guys. Ali Husain Thanks, Chris. Next caller, please. Operator Your next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani Thanks a lot. I guess just a question on the Linear side you have had this under your belt for a few months now. So I am curious when it comes to revenue synergies, where are you guys more focused on to drive revenue synergies, because I would imagine consumer might be the easiest place to get it or the quickest place to get it, but perhaps not the most ideal one for you. So, how do you think about the end markets and revenue synergies as you go forward? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, I think as we have talked about earlier on, the various markets, all of different cycles in terms of uptake, design cycles and adoption cycles. But I think obviously every sector in which we play, including consumer, has an opportunity for ADI to draw Linear Technology power management for additional revenue opportunity and growth. I would say it’s a medium-term to see the effect anyway of leveraging existing products and getting any meaningful revenue growth from those products is probably a 2 to 3-year proposition as we have experienced as well with Hittite. But I think the areas that we will see meaningful growth in the medium-term here will be automotive for sure. I think the communications sector will see a good uptick in the medium-term. Very judiciously as well, we are looking at some consumer opportunities. So obviously, those hit probably sooner than any other sector of the portfolio we manage. And I think industrial is 3 years plus from here. So I think that’s the way to think about the adoption of existing products and new sockets and the effect that we should see on revenue growth here. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Amit Daryanani I do, sir. I guess your consumer guide for July, modest sequential growth. I think last couple of years it’s been triple-digitish kind of number in the July quarter. The delta, do you think it’s due to later product launches in that segment or a change in the content that you guys have or maybe the OEMs that have more comfort around your ability around these products of asking you to do it a little bit later? It seems to be a fairly big delta, which we have seen the last 2 years at least. So, perhaps help us explain what’s driving that? Ali Husain Yes. So, I guess I will take that. I think we answered the question earlier in the call. I think this is definitely something that is, I would say more related to ADI. And we just have our content in various products are very much SKU dependent and we just think we will have a different kind of a mix this year relative to previous years. But I’d say as we progress into 2018, my expectation is that our B2B mix – our B2B markets expand as a percentage of total revenue as a result. Amit Daryanani Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter guys. Vincent Roche Thank you. Operator Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on your execution as you get started in the new area with Linear Tech. My question is regarding the synergies for the combined company. It’s clear, Vincent, that the company is quite happy with the way the early combined work is going. The question is does the progress on synergies thus far cause you to think differently about the linearity with which you expect to realize the $150 million in cost gains from the two companies? Vincent Roche No. I think when we have talked about synergies, we have been very clear that we have acquired LT for all its capabilities in terms of technology and customer management channel, channel management, operations and so on to drive revenue synergy over the long-term. But no, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, I am very pleased with the progress that we are making. We have – we had actually executed a lot of the decisions on the $150 million of synergies in advance of combining the companies. And the synergies are well-identified and the actions are in place to get the synergies executed. So my sense is it will take us, during the coming year, to really see the effects of the synergies in our P&L from a cost perspective. And a little bit longer than that I think as I have just been talking about to get the synergies from the cross-selling opportunities. Ali Husain Right, Craig, another follow-up? Craig Ellis Yes. Thanks for that Ali. And I follow-up on an end market, communications Vincent, I think you have mentioned 5G a couple of times and it seems like relative to 4G, the bigger picture is that, that seems to be more on track or maybe pulling in a little bit earlier versus what we had seen with some of the prior interface changes, but with regard to that opportunity, when would ADI expect 5G related infrastructure revenues to start to become a material part of its communications segment? Thank you. Vincent Roche I think your point is well taken. I think originally when we began talking about 5G, we were talking about it being a facet of our business in kind of 2020-plus. It now seems that we are obviously in trials right now with 5G, all the major application areas, all the major customers globally. So my own sense is that we will begin to see, I think a meaningful ramp in revenue in the 2019 kind of area. Maybe it’s a little sooner, maybe it’s a little later, but that’s my sense at this point in time that there is an aggressive pull in at the carrier level as well as the OEMs to make faster progress in deploying 5G. Ali Husain Alright. Craig, thank you. And we will get through our next caller. Operator Your next question is from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra Hi, good morning. You had mentioned that you recently that you have seen the small cell business finally picking up, what’s your market share in that business, which I am assuming has been fairly small and what type of growth are we looking and what type of revenue contribution can we get in the next say – in the next 12 months to 18 months? Ali Husain Yes. Hi Tristan, let me try and take a crack at that. I am sure Vince would be much more eloquent than I could ever be. But in any event, I would say on the small cell side, it’s been a relatively small contributor to our growth. I guess what we are particularly proud of are our integrated transceiver solutions that are picking up content both on macro base stations and in small cell base stations. So to be perfectly candid with you, we are pretty agnostic as to where these platforms end up. What is really important for ADI is the channel count. And so as long as you got more and more things that are connecting up, we tend to do extremely well when that happens. And so that could be a small cell, that could be a macro base station, but we are doing extremely well in the marketplace. We had another record quarter on top of our record quarter in the prior quarter in our integrated transceiver solutions that are just sucking up a lot of bill of materials and allowing us to gain share in this market. So interestingly you saw our results this quarter. And again it speaks to the diversity of our communications infrastructure market and our business. But our sequential revenue growth was led by wireless infrastructure and our year-over-year growth was led by wireline infrastructure. So you can see the diversity there. The other point I would make is with the addition of Linear Tech, our communications infrastructure business is more diversified than ever. In the past, about two-thirds of our calls business was wireless. At the current time, it’s more like 50-50. So I think we have the full suite of technology and we are pretty agnostic as to form factor. We have got the products and I think really it’s a question of as the market percolates, we are going to do extremely well. Vincent Roche Yes. I think just to add a little bit of color to what Ali has said, small cell is still a small activity from a market perspective. We are very, very well positioned. And I think it will start to accelerate so much during the course of the next 12 months to 18 months and become a more meaningful part of the overall wireless story in communications infrastructure. Ali Husain Alright. So you answered it better than I would. Thanks Tristan, do you have a follow-up? Tristan Gerra Yes, if I could. And thanks for the very useful answer. It looks like your Hittite business has grown fairly significantly since the close, could you provide some color on what’s been driving that growth, has it been share gain, new products or just distribution synergies and the question really relates to how should we look at Linear Tech in terms of the experience that you have gained with Hittite and the revenue growth achievement that you have done with Hittite? Vincent Roche Okay. Well, let me try and unpack. There were a couple of key questions there. I think with Hittite, we knew that the technology was very, very strong. And ADI, one of the big synergies we got from acquiring Hittite was just the channel reach, the customer reach and the channel reach that ADI had, that Hittite didn’t have. So we have been able to leverage that to tremendous effect. We knew that the portfolio products, was very, very strong. So, that’s been a huge help to us. Obviously, we have been able to architect. We have been together now almost 3 years and we have been able to architect some really new creative solutions in areas like aerospace and defense, phased array antenna, for example, these new radar systems that are being deployed as radar systems digitize across the globe. Even in instrumentation where a lot of the high-frequency systems require the combination of mix signal and microwave technology. Obviously, in the automotive sector where all these microwave technologies are being deployed, we are having the combination of ADI and Hittite there has been really, really powerful. So, I think it’s – it was a case of a lot of products that needed a new channel and a lot of re-architecting of customer systems based upon ADI’s signal processing mix signal strength and Hittite’s microwave strength. So what was the second part of that question? Ali Husain How would you leverage that to Linear? Vincent Roche So, leverage to Linear, I think the approach we have on the best of both was also true with Hittite. We tried to figure out how to be patient, understand the world class capabilities that Hittite had in terms of people and technology. And we have taken the very same approach with LTC. LTC is obviously a world class company as well. So just being patient, listening to create something greater than sum of the parts, build a whole new operating system across the company for speed and simplification. That’s what we did with Hittite and that’s what we are doing with LTC x5. Ali Husain Great. Thanks for the question. And we are zooming into the 11 o’clock hour here, so we are going to do our best to get to everybody. In case we can’t, feel free to call our Investor Relations phone at 781-461-3282. So we will continue until 11:00. Next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. You talked a bit about the trajectory of synergies on OpEx. What about on the $15 million in COGS? Can you give us fueling for how much of that, if any, is embedded in the Q3 guidance or where might we see that by the end of the year and should we expect a different trajectory of capturing those gross margin synergies versus what you are suggesting we should think about for the OpEx side? Ali Husain Yes, I know I’d say on the gross margin side, we are very early in the process. I’d say those are all very much on the comp. I wouldn’t expect to see those in Q3 or Q4 this year. Did you have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon I did. On the OpEx or just on the cost synergies, in general, it doesn’t sound like you are quite ready to take the target up. But can you give us a feeling given how far you are in the planning phase and which areas have proved maybe easier than you might have thought initially as well as more difficult? And if we were looking for potential upside, where do you think it might be easiest to squeeze more out? Vincent Roche Well, clearly we have been able to reduce the public company cost of the combined company. That’s one of the things that’s been executed pretty much straight away. I think we had talked before as well about an early retirement program that we had put in place at ADI and we begin to see the benefits of that fettering in over the next couple of quarters. But the – and obviously, distribution channel optimization as well that we had talked about before that will start to show benefits to us, I think towards the back end of this year and the early part of the coming year. So, there are just three or four examples of the things that we have already got in play that we will start to see the benefit of. And all the other synergies are identified. And we have got the actions in place and we are now just ready to realize them. Ali Husain Yes. And Stacy, I will just add we have talked about it before, but the EPS accretion in the third quarter is expected to be 15%. And I think if you start baking some of these synergies in the 2018, I think you get a number well north of that. So, we look forward to updating you on the model and any potential updates on the synergy target next month at the Analyst Meeting. Alright. I think we just hit the 11 o’clock hour. So listen, thank you everybody for joining us this morning.

My name is Crystal, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I\'d like to welcome everyone to ADP\'s Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded, and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you, Crystal, and good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP\'s Vice President, Investor Relations. I\'m here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP\'s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jan Siegmund, ADP\'s Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. I\'d like to remind everyone that today\'s call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current excitations. Now, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. Today, we released our third quarter fiscal 2017 results, with reported revenue growth of 5% to $3.4 billion. This revenue growth includes about 1 percentage point of pressure from the second quarter disposition of our spending accounts in COBRA businesses. Our diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.31. Jan will take you through the key contributing factors to our performance in more detail shortly. Our new business bookings this quarter declined by 7%, as we continued to overcome the strong fiscal 2016 sales of solutions that assist our clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act. I\'d like to remind you that the Affordable Care Act factor was quite unique and that it helped accelerate various buying decisions across our mid- and upmarkets, both from new client share and our existing base. Nevertheless, our pipeline of HCM opportunities continues to be strong, as we leverage our investments in our strategic cloud platforms, Vantage and Workforce Now. Now, let me discuss client retention. As we reported, retention declined 170 basis points for the quarter. The losses that contributed to this decline were concentrated on our legacy platforms, and we believe some of these losses were triggered by our upgrade activities in the mid- and upmarket. We maintain our core belief that these migrations are the right thing to do for our clients as well as for ADP. Our midmarket migrations are anticipated to be completed by the end of this calendar year, while the migration efforts upmarket will be phased in over time in partnership with our clients. Client satisfaction and retention remains high on our strategic platforms, and we are seeing that with our midmarket Workforce Now platform. The feedback from clients on this platform has been positive. In fact, a report from G2 Crowd, a leading business solutions review platform, recently added ADP Workforce Now to its Best Software 2017 list in the Core HR category. This list is based exclusively on feedback from users of the product. We ranked highest for ease-of-use, quality of support, which is especially gratifying given our focus on service and the user experience. ADP\'s success over the past 68 years is tied to our ability to keep pace with our clients\' evolving needs across economic cycles. As our recent workforce vitality report indicated, the labor market continues to be robust, and we see our clients becoming increasingly focused on talent, finding, retaining and engaging critical staff in a much more competitive environment. Our recent acquisition of the Marcus Buckingham Company, which we completed in the third quarter, is an example of our commitment to assist clients in meeting their talent needs. When it comes to talent and performance management, we know the needs of each client and each team are unique. By adding TMBC\'s content, coaching and technology solutions to the ADP portfolio, we now offer a suite of proven products to help leaders unleash the talent of their teams and create value for our clients. We\'ve talked before about our focus on the user experience and delivering solutions that our clients and their employees find easier and more intuitive to use. We\'ve applied that same thinking to our channel partners with the introduction of ADP Accountant Connect. We\'re particularly proud of the continued strength and robust growth of our downmarket, where we now have over 500,000 clients on our RUN platform. And this unique solution provides our accountant channel partners with a unified view of payroll as well as reporting and tax information for all our shared clients. This solution was developed in collaboration with our accountant channel partners to meet their needs and has already been recognized by Accountant Today (sic) [Accounting Today] (5:41) as one its 2017 top new products in the accountant resources category. We believe solutions like ADP Accountant Connect will help further enhance our relationships with this important referral channel while creating a better experience for our shared clients. We are also pleased to recently receive recognition from NelsonHall, a global BPO analyst firm, who identified ADP as a leader in payroll services for the fourth consecutive year. In naming us a leader, the NelsonHall report highlighted our global reach and the breadth of our service offering, allowing clients ranging from small businesses to global enterprises to choose how much expertise they wish to retain in-house or to outsource. In its report, NelsonHall also recognized ADP\'s ability to help clients benchmark their workforce metrics against industry averages using the ADP data cloud. And they also recognize the ADP Marketplace, which helps clients access an ecosystem of enterprise applications from ADP and our partners to extend the value of their HCM solutions. It\'s great to be recognized in the industry, but it\'s also great when we see our company recognized more broadly, which is why I was especially proud to see Fortune magazine name us to their Most Admired Companies\' list for the 11th time and rank us number one in our category for the fifth straight time. I\'m particularly proud of this because it\'s a testament to the confidence our stakeholders place in us and to the continued dedication of our 57,000 associates. In closing, despite the pressure on new business bookings and retention, we remain confident in the enduring qualities of our business. We are pleased with the continued strong performance of our PEO and multinational solutions and with our improving service metrics within the midmarket. We are especially pleased with our success in the downmarket, which continues to demonstrate the value of our strategy to deliver great technology and great service. We are confident that this strategy is the right one to help our clients succeed, which will in turn drive sustained growth for ADP. With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our third quarter results and an update on the fiscal 2017 outlook. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. ADP revenues for the quarter grew 5% on a reported basis, 6% organic. Our revenue growth this quarter experienced pressure as we began to lap our fiscal year 2016 ACA-related revenues. Pre-tax earnings from continuing operations before taxes grew 4% on a reported basis to $828 million, despite almost 2 percentage points of combined pressure from our second quarter business disposition and our fiscal year 2017 acquisitions. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 4%. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 20 basis points, compared to 24.8% in last year\'s third quarter. Our margins this quarter were impacted by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations cost related to our service alignment initiative. Our net earnings grew 10% on a reported basis to $588 million and benefited from a lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate this quarter was aided by an incremental tax benefit related to prior period software development efforts, $0.04 of which was not previously anticipated and $0.02 tax benefit related to the adoption of new stock-based compensation accounting guidance. Diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.31 and benefited from fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Our new business bookings performance this quarter was disappointing. However, we have continued to make investments into our sales organization to better position us for growth. We\'re confident in the competitiveness of our portfolio and the strength of our distribution capabilities, and in turn, our ability to execute on our pipeline of market opportunities. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 2% on a reported basis for the quarter and included 1 percentage points of pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses earlier this fiscal year. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.5% in the third quarter. Average client fund balances grew 2% on a reported basis, or 3% on a constant dollar basis compared to a year ago. As a result of improving employment, we have continued to see pressure from lower state unemployment insurance collections impact client fund balances. This pressure was offset by a combination of wage inflation and growth in our pays per control metric. Employer Services margin decreased about 40 basis points in the quarter. This decrease was driven by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations related to our service alignment initiative. PEO revenues grew 12% in the quarter with average worksite employees growing 12% to 471,000. The PEO continued to experience slowing growth in the benefit pass-through costs, resulting from lower health care renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation of our worksite employees during the quarter. The PEO margins continued to expand through operational efficiencies, which helped drive approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. New business bookings this quarter were down 7%. And as a result, we now expect new business bookings for fiscal year 2017 to decline about 5% to 7% compared to the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We have also updated certain other elements of our fiscal 2017 forecast, which I will now take you through. Despite our revised new business bookings guidance and this quarter\'s revenue retention decline, our revenue outlook remains unchanged at about 6%. This forecast continues to include 1 percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impacts from foreign currency. While Employer Services segment consistent with our prior forecast, revenue growth is anticipated to be 3% to 4%, which continues to include 1 percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impacts from foreign currency. For the PEO, ADP continues to anticipate revenue growth of 13%. We continue to expect our consolidated adjusted EBIT margin expansion to be about 50 basis points, which includes about 20 basis points of pressure from dual operations pertaining to our service alignment initiative, which was not part of our non-GAAP charges. On a segment level, we continue to anticipate margin expansion in Employer Services of 25 basis points to 50 basis points. For the PEO, we expect continued operating efficiencies and slower growth in our pass-through revenues as compared to fiscal year 2016 to help drive margin expansion on a full year basis. Accordingly, we continue to expect fiscal year 2017 PEO margin expansion of at least 100 basis points. We are also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to increase to about $20 million compared with our prior forecasted increase of about $15 million. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to be up about $15 million compared to the prior forecast of about $10 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. As a result of the software development related tax benefit, some of which was not previously contemplated in our prior guidance and the additional benefit related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, we now estimate our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 to be 31.4% as compared to our prior forecasted rate of 32.4%. Based upon our revision of our effective tax rate guidance; adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 13% to 14% compared to our prior forecast of 11% to 13%. Our forecast also continues to contemplate a return of excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases of $1.2 billion to $1. 4 billion, subject to market conditions during fiscal year 2017. This forecast includes any repurchases required to offset dilution related to employee benefit plans. So, with that, I will turn the call back to our operator to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We will take our first question from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. Good morning. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good morning. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Last quarter – I\'m thinking of it as the December quarter – you showed an improvement in client retention, I believe, 10 basis points; in this quarter, the March quarter, down 170 basis points. What was the major change between the December quarter and the March quarter that led to that decline in client revenue retention? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think as we mentioned, I think, in our opening comments, it was concentrated in our legacy platforms in the midmarket and in the upmarket. It was particularly skewed towards the upmarket this quarter. Some of the losses, as you know, we don\'t provide guidance. And in the December quarter, we wouldn\'t have talked about forward-looking retention. But some of the deterioration that we experienced in the quarter was anticipated as a result of some known large losses. We typically have reasonable amount of visibility, sometimes several quarters, if not a year or more, for very large clients when they are moving off of one of our solutions. But I guess the core message we are trying to deliver in our comments is that it continues to be concentrated in our legacy platforms. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. And just as a quick follow-up, it would seem that the decline in new bookings this year and some of the pressure on client revenue retention would be more consequential for fiscal 2018 given the way your revenue model works. Can you give us some preliminary thoughts about fiscal 2018 based on the retention trends and the booking trends you\'re seeing in FY 2017? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think you\'re right about the way the math works for our business. And I think that\'s why Jan was very clear in kind of reaffirming our guidance for, obviously, the rest of the year, because we\'re so far into the year that these variations and retention in sales have very low impact on the current next quarter and even maybe one quarter after that. But clearly, going forward, for the next fiscal year, it does roll into the math in terms of that waterfall chart that we\'ve shared with you. As you know, we don\'t provide guidance for fiscal year 2018 until our August call. So we\'re really in the middle of our operating plan process and we\'ll obviously have better information then in terms of how that waterfall chart exactly falls through in terms of the various factors that impact our revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that\'s true. But, David, you\'re mathematically correct that our new business bookings get implemented and turn into revenue after six months approximately and so some of the impact of our lower retention and lower sales will be seen in the revenue growth next year, as you roll it forward. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just the first one, if I heard you correctly, it sounded like the midmarket client migrations have been pushed out by two quarters. The question, I guess, is why have you pushed that out? And then expanding on that a little bit further, as you\'re starting, it sounds like with the upmarket – how has what you\'ve seen in midmarket colored your expectations and how you are going to approach the upmarket? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think, you\'re right about the timing that we were hoping that we would be done. I think our wording was that we would be done somewhere around the end of this fiscal year. And so, now we\'re saying by the end of the calendar year. Realistically, we really don\'t do migrations in November and December because we have year-end and a lot of activities going on. So it\'s really a few months and its a few clients or a few thousand clients, because in the midmarket, we\'re talking about clients in the thousands. And just as a reminder, there were tens of thousands. I think the total number of client migrations was somewhere around 50,000 or 60,000 clients. And so what we\'re talking about is, I would say, a couple of thousand stragglers that we felt, in order to just meet an artificial deadline wasn\'t worth. We learned our lesson, I think, a year-and-a-half ago around when we had to accelerate, in some cases we were forced to accelerate migrations as a result of ACA to get clients on our new platform in order to be able to give them that solution. We learned through that process that you want to really truly upgrade the clients and have them feel that it\'s an upgrade, not a forced march or a negative experience. And so we\'re just focused on making sure that it\'s the right kind of experience and we felt like a couple of thousand clients falling over from one fiscal year to the other is really not that big of a deal in our minds. And I think it\'s the right thing to do. And I think, to answer your question about how that experience colors our approach in the upmarket, again, I think we learned some lessons in terms of making sure that we do things at the proper pace, and that we do it in partnership with our clients. And I think that becomes much more important in the upmarket where it\'s much more complex, and clients have, in many cases, provide a lot of their own internal resources in order to make a migration happen. In the small market, when we did those migrations, there was very little effort and very little need for clients to be involved. In the midmarket, there was a little bit more effort and a little more involvement by the clients. And in the upmarket, there\'s quite a lot of involvement. And hence, it has to be much more carefully planned and, hence, you\'re probably hearing from us that it\'s going to be a longer process in terms of getting those upgrades completed. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Then just a follow-up, as you\'ve had a little more time in the new service delivery geographies, how was the ability to find talent then? How is it compared to your expectations for shifting to those locations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think it\'s fair to say that we are – and again, we\'re early in our goals here. But really, we\'re on track. So we\'re actually quite pleased. We\'ve got several thousand people already hired in our new locations in Orlando, in Maitland, which is near Orlando; in Norfolk, Virginia; and we\'re already hiring also in Tempe. And it is in addition to Augusta and El Paso where we already had two strategic locations. And we have a couple of other key locations, but those are the ones that we\'ve been talking the most about regarding our strategic alignment initiative. So I\'d say we\'re pleased with the talent, we\'re pleased with the pace. I think we\'re on plan in terms of the number of people we were intending to hire. We\'re on plan in terms of the wage levels and the quality of the talent. I have obviously visited, and I think Jan, we\'ve all visited these locations. In fact, we had a very large associate town hall meeting in our Norfolk, Virginia location. And it may be a honeymoon phase but it\'s an incredibly energetic environment. People are very positive and very bullish on ADP. I think we\'re considered a great employer in the markets that we are entering. And we\'ve got a lot of help from other parts of the organization getting these folks trained and ready to be able to actually deliver service, and in some cases they obviously already are. And that\'s why we have some of these dual operations cost that Jan has referred to a couple of times, because we\'re trying to make sure that we do this in a very careful and methodical way. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning. Thanks as always for all the disclosure. Just a couple of questions. Just on the pricing front, on successfully migrating clients to the new strategic platforms, any surprises there? Did that contribute at all to the bookings forecast? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just to be clear, when we migrate our clients, the migration itself is not counting as a new business booking because business bookings account only incremental recurring revenue that we report. So the migration is generally cost-neutral to our clients, and they have enhanced feature functionality with a new product that they get. In the process, clients continue to make buying decisions and buy incremental modules as they do, and we have seen that trend continue in particular in the midmarket. But the actual migration is revenue-neutral, as we approach it, and that will be the same for all upmarket clients. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Thanks for that clarification. I wasn\'t sure if the change might get captured in the (24:26) business bookings. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. So the change – if a client buys more, I don\'t have the most recent statistics here, but I think the trends continue that a number of clients purchases incremental modules as they see the power of the integrated platform. And so there is some slight revenue uptick that we do see for the clients who choose it and only that incremental revenue would be reflected. But it would be immaterial for the new business bookings number in total. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. One more quick follow-up. I know Jan because you\'ve been sort of, I guess, signaling or suggesting that some of these things could happen with ACA. But I\'m just curious, just looking back now, is some of the reduction in this bookings outlook – is there a way to quantify how much might be related to the weak follow-through on ACA module sales and the related tough comp on ACA modules versus maybe a pull-forward of broader payroll HCM sales related to ACA? Do you follow my question? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I do. And I think that it is – as I think we\'ve been trying to signal for, I think, probably three years if you go back to my notes, it\'s very hard because we\'re obviously in uncharted territories, because we were in something completely new. And it was a very comprehensive regulatory framework that required a lot of information from HR platforms, payroll platforms, benefit platforms, et cetera. And when you look back, we had two years of more than 12% new business bookings growth. And this is why we were cautious all along because that is a little strong. We were happy with it and we take it. It\'s good for our shareholders. It\'s good for ADP. It\'s good for our revenues. But it definitely felt like a fairly significant tailwind. And I think, in hindsight, it was obviously a big tailwind. Now, what has now added, I think, potentially to that pressure, which again we can\'t quantify scientifically is that we have, I think, a different environment politically that\'s creating some uncertainty, that certainly has impacted our new business bookings. We just can\'t put our finger on exactly to what extent. So as an example, we knew we had a grow-over issue just for ACA itself because we had already sold 50% of our addressable client base. But we did have some planned sales of ACA this year. And even though we\'ve gotten some, it\'s significantly lower than plan, which is not surprising given the headlines and the frequent votes on repeal and replace of ACA. And so I think that\'s a second factor that I think was not certainly anticipated as we entered into this fiscal year in terms of our planning process. We knew we had to grow over the mathematical grow-over issue. Now we have what I would call the political issue. And then the third one that you mentioned, which again, is very hard for us to put our finger on, but I think you\'re onto something because we experienced the same thing back when we had the Y2K phenomenon in year 2000, where you do have some amount of pull forward, if you will, of business because we\'ve seen this particularly on some of our wins last year from ERPs were quite high and elevated. And I think some of that, it appears, with the benefit of hindsight is, people on kind of older legacy technology trying to find a new solution for ACA. And by the way, some of that happened to us. So as we mentioned, before we think some of our retention issues last year may have been related to the same factor of people kind of just out looking for new solutions as a result of what I would call an event, which is a significant event called ACA. So I think all three things are a factor. We really wish we could put our finger on exactly how much each one is accountable. But unfortunately, we can\'t. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. Thanks so much for the insights. It\'s helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to follow-up on the prior question. On the new bookings weakness you\'re seeing and specifically the revision to guidance. Obviously, going from flat to down 5% for the full year. I think you had talked the last quarter about seeing confidence in improving bookings rates as you head through the end of the year. I guess, maybe you could talk anecdotally about what changed from three months ago to today in terms of specific client conversations you\'re having, is it simply the regulatory environment, uncertainty, seizing things up in terms of purchasing decisions? And then if you got any color on what clients are telling you about what they have to see to get more confidence to book? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think that a couple of comments and maybe Jan can add in terms of his observations. We\'ve obviously been meeting frequently with our sales leaders, and I\'ve been going around sales meetings trying to get to put my finger on the pulse. And it doesn\'t appear that it\'s the economy, because we have very robust and strong results in our downmarket. Our PEO is still doing well. Our MNC business had a great quarter. A lot of the channels that we sell through small business like our Insurance Services products and our Retirement Services products are also doing quite well. So it\'s really not an across-the-board weakness. It does appear to be concentrated in places where we had the ACA phenomenon, if you will. And then how much of it is related to just the grow-over itself versus uncertainty about the political environment, and the fact that the people maybe are sitting and waiting. We do have some information around our pipeline, which is not the same as bookings. So bookings are bookings, and we are very clear about how we count revenues. And I think Jan just went through the math. But we do have pipeline reports like any sales force would have pipeline reports. And in our midmarket and our upmarket, we feel pretty good like we did last quarter about our pipeline. So if we say we feel pretty good and the sales are not materializing, that can only lead to only one conclusion, which is the decision-making is getting elongated or slowing. And we can\'t quite put our finger on why, but that\'s exactly the math is showing versus our pipeline right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think the only thing, Jim, just keep in mind our new guidance is down 5% to 7%, is our expected new business bookings guidance and I think Carlos captured it. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Understand. And then maybe as a follow-up. Can you maybe just talk about the regulatory environment changes and what impact that could have on the PEO business? And specifically, what\'s your confidence level in that PEO business kind of sustaining double-digit growth for the foreseeable future? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good question. Actually, let me finish also. I think you mentioned about like tone in the sales force. And one of the kind of surprising things for me at least is the tone in the sales force is still very positive. Like, we\'ve done some things to try to "encourage people not to throw in the towel" because this is another factor that I have to worry about, right, that we are close to our end of our fiscal year, and the way our incentive systems work, there\'s a big incentive when you\'re exceeding plan to over exceed it. And, likewise, there\'s a bit of an incentive to throw in the towel, if you will, if you\'re having a bad year. So we\'ve done some things to try to – and that may be why the sales forces still remains upbeat, or maybe because they think these issues are transitory. It\'s very, again, hard to put a scientific answer on it. But it feels positive in terms of the tone in the sales force. On the question about PEO and the regulatory environment, I think I mentioned multiple times also in the PEO over the last couple of years that it felt like we were getting some tailwind as a result of ACA, if for no other reason because it was creating conversation opportunities, right. Because people are looking for a solution and they\'re looking at maybe different alternatives and someone is able to talk to them about the PEO, and I think it\'s compelling value proposition they\'re able to close the business. So I would put the PEO in the same category that we were watching, if you will. It\'s not quite the same in the sense that many of the clients in the PEO are not necessarily buying only ACA. And we\'re not rushing to make a decision of that magnitude only because of ACA. So I think there\'s a subtle but important difference. So I\'m not convinced and we certainly aren\'t seeing it in the numbers yet that the PEO will have the same kind of difficulties, if you will, growing over. But it\'s definitely a more difficult sales environment for the PEO. But having said that, just again we\'ve said this multiple times that the PEO has grown double-digits for, I think, its 17 years now. And so it\'s just a very compelling value proposition. And if, for example, there are changes in the regulatory landscape, some parts of our business may be affected like our direct ACA product, if the entire thing gets repealed and the whole thing goes away, that would not be good news for that part of the business. But, as we know now from what we\'re hearing of what\'s growing through Congress, there\'s not going to be a complete repeal. There\'s going to be some kind of new framework. Those types of new frameworks are always good for the PEO because they intend to be more state-based regulation, which is what the PEO is really good at and what small companies are not very good at in having to deal with. And so I think that I would remain generally optimistic and positive – more optimistic and more positive about the PEO. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is open. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first, just wanted to start off, I know you just touched on this a little bit, but a little more color would be helpful. I mean, I understand why businesses are holding off with regards to ACA solutions, just given the uncertainties that you mentioned around healthcare in the U.S. as a whole. But at the end of the day, the law is the law, right. So kind of like at what point, if reform keeps being delayed, do you think employers will start to demand the solutions you\'re offering around ACA and just make other buying decisions in general that they may have been holding off because of the uncertainty? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We were hoping that that would happen two weeks ago or three weeks ago when President said that he was done with it and that we\'re moving on to tax reform. And unfortunately, that was not – it appears not to have been the case. So I think we\'re watching the same news you\'re watching. We do have obviously some access to and some information that we get from people in Washington about what\'s happening on the Hill and the regulation and so forth. But we have kind of similar information to what everyone else has. And these things always, when you\'re in the middle of them, feel like your feet are in cement. And that\'s how it feels like to us right now. It\'s very frustrating but these things pass. We will look back a year or two from now and there will either be the existing ACA or some other version or some more complicated state regime or complex regulatory framework at the state level. And we\'ll hopefully be looking back and seeing this as yet another opportunity for ADP to shine and to help our clients. But right now, it is what it is, and it doesn\'t feel great. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Thanks. And then just to follow up, when you think about the slide that you guys put out, just your long-term growth driver, the 7% to 9% that you think of the longer term and I think you have like a 14% to 15% new business bookings and 7% to 8% reduction from client losses. Just how does that math change given the bookings guidance that you\'re seeing right now? And I know 2018 is a little early, but just any color you can give us on how to think about how that 7% to 9% growth might be impacted for fiscal 2018? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. Our longer-term expectations for organic growth is 7% to 9%, as you correctly quoted. And it\'s driven by growth of new business bookings in the range of 8% to 10% growth. And it always was meant to cover multiple year type of cycle elongated and it was not a commitment obviously, as you see realistically – not a commitment to perform every single fiscal year. So we are not updating our long-term growth outlook at this point in time. But, clearly, our new business bookings have fallen a little bit behind, but relative to a three- or four-year cycle of new business bookings, we still feel good about our growth opportunities. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just want to understand the bookings a little bit more. So a two-part question, part math, part more subjective. So the math is just to get the full-year guidance. Seems like you\'re implying potentially further deterioration in the fourth quarter, unless maybe the weighting from the third quarter is disproportionate, so maybe some clarification there. And then the second part of that is maybe you can just talk about the cadence exiting the selling season and into April? Carlos, you already talked a little bit about hoping to see some change as of two weeks ago but not seeing it but maybe just a little bit more color. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think you\'re right that the third quarter is disproportionate. So we have a lot of – disproportionate number of dollar sales in the third quarter compared to the entire year. And that\'s just the way the seasonality has always worked. So the fourth quarter would not be materially different in terms of the momentum or this kind of the 5% to 7% down range. It\'s in that ballpark. So there is really no real news I think there. I think the cadence in terms of the exit for the – the one thing that we\'re grappling with is, obviously, we have the realities, right, of the political environment and we\'re hoping that there will be resolution here relatively soon. Our fiscal year, obviously, starts on July 1. We\'re hoping to have some kind of – we thought two, three weeks ago, we had clarity. So we\'re hoping that we get that behind us and we get some clarity, because we have lots of other products. We have lots of other parts of our business that are performing well. And we just want to get on with it, right, and be able to continue to sell the other suite of products that we have available both in the midmarket and also in the upmarket. So I think, as I mentioned before, it feels like exiting the year, our pipelines are robust. It feels like the tone and the confidence in the sales force is high. But the results are the results. And I think Jan and I live in a world of reality, not in the world of make-believe. And so we\'re being cautious and careful, but it\'s hard not to be optimistic because the economy is picking up it feels like. The labor markets are tightening. And we have some very compelling value propositions in that kind of environment where employers now are going to be "engaging" in a war for talent again, which we haven\'t seen. We forget that 10 years ago there was real issue in terms of finding people. And we benefited back then from that kind of environment in terms of our HCM solutions, and we\'re hoping that we\'re entering a period here where all of our solutions, the entire suite becomes very compelling as clients become focused on attracting people and holding onto the people that they have. And we see all kinds of metrics in our own numbers and in the government data around higher voluntary turnover, higher wage growth, lots of signals that the labor markets are tightening. And I think our value propositions are very compelling in that kind of environment. So we just want to get this uncertainty and these delays and this slow decision-making behind us so that we can get on to the business. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe just... Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ...a little comment to this on the outlook, which Carlos described correctly kind of roughly in line with fourth quarter and the full-year guidance. But we\'ll also continue to put our dollars where our statements are and the investments into the sales force, the incentives that we\'re bringing out to get the sales force ready, and the hiring and preparing for growth in the next year are actually fully underway and have actually to some degree impacted our third quarter and fourth quarter results because we believe we have that opportunity going forward. So we\'re preparing for growth in the future. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. And then just a question on retention. I just wanted to clarify. So it sounded like some of the higher attrition was in the upmarket and was partly related to migration. But at the same time, you\'re taking a more measured pace with your migration relative to what you do with Workforce Now. So just trying to square that and see maybe where any surprises came versus expectations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Maybe one is connected to the other and maybe not. Because I think the reality is that the variability and I think we\'re very sensitive now obviously to retention for all the right reasons because we went through a really difficult last year, but we\'ve had variability in our retention forever at ADP because it\'s a different metric than our other metrics and it can be volatile. And as an example, in the upmarket, you can have one or two large clients that can actually move that number – one or two clients in the upmarket that can move the number for the upmarket and for ADP. And you saw a little bit of that in the first quarter where we lost that large government contract and the business that we ended up selling or were in the process of selling that had a material impact on our overall retention for the first quarter. So this wasn\'t one large client like that, but it was a handful of clients. And so our upmarket business is a little less than 20% of our overall revenue, so just to kind of put things in context and it\'s 2,000 to 3,000 clients. And a couple, literally, three, four client losses in a particular quarter can really move the number. So I was just trying to help kind of frame the discussion because at least for now I\'m not ready to conceive that we have a permanent – we don\'t talk about forward guidance on retention, but this is a third quarter issue for now. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. All right. One more on the topic of the day, retention. So the upmarket dynamic you\'re describing, I guess, does feel like it\'s a little bit new. Is there a change in the competitive landscape in the upmarket? Or is there anything you can identify that triggered I guess this handful of clients this quarter? Or is it just somewhat anomalous? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s a good question. And I think that you\'d be generally I think right that despite the fact that we do have volatility across quarters, we have generally not paid a lot of attention to it because over the course of kind of rolling 12 months or even in terms of years, calendar years or even fiscal years, our retention in the upmarket has been pretty stable. I mean it\'s a sticky business. It doesn\'t change a whole lot. So I\'d say this quarter was – I\'d say it\'s fair that it\'s a little bit anomalous. And I think the answer to your other part of question; we don\'t see it as being related to any change in the competitive environment. Now, as always, in two to three years or in two to three quarters, I may be singing a different tune, but we have a lot of data around the reasons for the losses, what platform the losses were on, were they new technology, old technology, and what types of product the client had. And I think when we put all that information together, which Jan and I, obviously, spent a lot of time anticipating this being one of the topics of the day, we\'ve spent a lot of time on this issue and looked at the names of the clients, who they are, what platforms they were on, and we don\'t see any change in the competitive environment. I think we\'ve said before that there isn\'t any one competitor that causes us a majority of our losses, and likewise there isn\'t any one competitor where we take the majority of our business from. It\'s spread out all over the landscape and it remains that way. For some of our competitors that might be different because of their size where they may have a heavy concentration of taking clients from one particular company. In our case, that is not the case. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe a tiny bit of further detail, Lisa, is when we look at our competitive position against this multitude of competitors in the quarter, some competitive positions have improved and some have not. And that is a fairly typical thing we see each of these competitors evolving quarter-by-quarter up and down. So when we say the general competitive dynamic we feel has not changed, it\'s rooted in this analysis, and we see in some cases we have improved and some cases we have not. So it\'s a mixed bag obviously, but we believe it hasn\'t changed. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think I didn\'t maybe answer directly your question about how does this square with our upgrade or migrations strategy. And I think the things really are somewhat connected in maybe an odd way that we think that because we know what clients we lost and what platforms they were on that it makes it even more compelling for us to move our clients onto our newer technologies. On the other hand, we know that these movements are complex and that the clients need to help us and they need to be involved, they need to cooperate. And so finding the right clients in the right place at the right time is just different than it was in the midmarket and in the down market. But it think it heightens our confidence that it\'s the right thing to do over time. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. And then I guess the follow-up, as we\'ve been living with you through the Workforce Now migrations in the midmarket, I know you\'ve consistently said that the retention levels are higher on the migrated clients and so there\'s sort of this nirvana we are going to get to when the migrations are done where retention should naturally go back up. Are we though now facing a more protracted period in the upmarket kind of going to the same thing? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the nirvana, it does from what Jan and I were looking at just over the last couple of days, their retention rates on our current version Workforce Now strategic platform are extremely high, and we\'re very happy with them and we have a lot of volume on it already. So that feels like it worked out the way we had hoped and we had anticipated. And with now the down-market on our new strategic platform with potential rates that frankly have improved dramatically over the last couple years and with our Workforce Now migrations being completed by the end of this calendar year and with 20% of our base remaining in the upmarket, we\'re feeling good about where we are. But the answer to your question is, yes, we have a protracted migration effort in the upmarket. It\'s the right thing to do. We\'re going to do it, and we\'re going to do it as well as we can and as quickly as we can without causing damage and disruption to our clients. But we\'re in a very different position from where we were four or five years ago when we had 10% of our clients on our strategic platforms that are version-less in cloud where there is no further migration and there is no further disruption. So it\'s a very, very different place and it hasn\'t felt good getting here but it feels pretty good now. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. Maybe quickly just on a more positive note. I know you\'ve had the reporting and benchmarking modules out in the market now at least for a few months. How are they doing? How is the uptake? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s going well. Again, that\'s another one back to the discussion about what\'s happening with the labor markets and the economy in general. Those are products that are useful no matter what, but in the kind of environment that we\'re entering into like helping people make sure that they\'re paying people the right amounts, that they know where their turnover is in comparison to benchmarks, that type of information is very, very useful to an HR leader or to a CEO in making good people decisions on a go-forward basis. So that\'s another example of something that the conversations for the last two or three years were about ACA. I think the conversations for the next two or three years are going to be about what\'s happening with your workforce, what\'s the turnover rate, how are you paying people. And I think these benchmark and analytics tools are going to facilitate those discussions, and hopefully, those sales because those are conversation openers or starters in order to convince clients to come to our product suite, which is I think unique in a sense that it has these data and analytics benchmarks. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Terrific. Thank you. Thanks for all the transparency as usual. Operator Thank you. And our next question will come from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you so much. A few times you mentioned the uncertainty and you thought it might have dissipated a few weeks ago when we had a little bit more clarity on ACA. Is the client uncertainty and the elongated decision-making you think it\'s solely related to ACA issues? Are there just other things going on in the current environment that clients are worried about? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Again, I\'ll just say one more time. It\'s impossible for us. We don\'t really have like a chart that kind of follows that. So this is really more on intuition, and I\'ll let Jan comment as well. But it\'s not just ACA that\'s creating uncertainty. I think the administration has asked the Labor Department to review the overtime rules, for example, that were about to be issued. I think there were pay equity rules that were coming out around EEOC reporting that are now under review as well. The fiduciary rule, which was intended to go through the – which would have affected our Retirement Services business has also been put under review. And so I think there are pockets of uncertainty in addition to ACA. And some of them happened to be related to our core business, which is HCM. And so if you\'re selling, for example, an ERP suite, some of that uncertainty may not really affect that decision-making. But if we were involved in a sales process where you had a large hourly workforce and many of them – sorry, a large salaried workforce because of the new rules was going to now be hourly and those hours needed to be tracked and you needed to be in compliance with the FLSA, that sales cycle has probably been elongated as a client stops and goes back to focusing on whatever they were focusing on before that trigger event. So I think there are a few other things that are probably not helpful, but again, it\'s hard for us to put a specific measure on each one of them. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. I understand and I appreciate the color. And then just one, I guess, numbers or model-related question. When do we anniversary the bump in bookings from all the ACA-driven business? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, next fiscal year, we are clearly half – still a little bit of grow-over but not that material. So next year should be a clean year relative to the ACA-related grow-over. Just a further clarification, we have tried to illustrate this a few times. With the ACA core module that we have sold came off an incremental fuller bundled sales that particularly included benefit administration module. So the impact of the Affordable Care Act have been broader than the direct impact of the ACA-related sales, which makes it a little bit harder to predict. And as a consequence, our clients (54:35) typically provides ADP-wide about 50% of our incremental new business bookings, however, come from selling more to existing clients. And that dynamic has now changed because we have fuller bundles now in particular in the midmarket. And so we started to transition to drive new logo growth in the midmarket and those channels have to readjust a little bit as a consequence of the ACA surge that has driven a more complete bundle in particular in the midmarket. So that transition is still present obviously next year, but we feel that we have great strategies in place to replace basically that up-sell strategy with a more aggressive new logo sales. And as we have clarified, it is a disappointing quarter, but despite our down guidance for new business booking sale, it will still be our second highest sales year ever for ADP. So keep that in mind. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. This is actually Jay Hanna on for Gary today. Kind of going off that last comment, going forward, given the struggles with the client retention this quarter and the now expected decline in bookings, should we expect an even greater spend on sales force additions going forward? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, it\'s funny you should mention that, because I think Jan I think did address and I\'ll let him if he wants to give more detail, which we probably don\'t because we\'re not giving FY 2018 guidance yet. But we\'re definitely not taking our foot off of the accelerator. So we obviously could change our minds a quarter or two from now, but our position right now is I think we mentioned it in Jan\'s comments, we\'re maintaining our investments in service, implementation, et cetera. And in some cases we\'ve actually accelerated or increased some of our investments. And I think in the sales organization is a place where I would say we\'ve added expense. And the irony is that the underlying sales expense gets helped by weaker sales because our commissions are lower and so forth, but there\'s a lot of things that go into that sales expense bucket, including head count cost and commissions. And so it\'s safe to say that our commission expense and our variable expense is helping us from a cost standpoint. But instead of taking that all to the bottom line, we have chosen to invest because, again, we believe our story which is that nothing fundamentally has changed in the economy, which is typically what really affects ADP, which by the way affects us less than most because of the nature of our business model. But if we saw a recession coming or a slowdown coming, we would have to start thinking hard about our expense levels. And that\'s not where we are right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a quick reminder, as one of the advantages of ADP is that we serve such a broad range of segments and markets in the U.S. and globally and multinational, and so as we had our challenges in the mid and upmarket, we continue to perform tremendously in the down-market, in the PEO, multinational. So there\'s a broad range of products that are gaining share and really driving success. So obviously, in that balance, our investments into sales signal our confidence for ultimate success in distribution. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of product-related questions. With regards to the higher ratings in terms of the G2 for Workforce Now, at what point do you start pivoting from migration of existing clients to proactively selling Workforce Now to clients that aren\'t currently utilizing ADP at all in the midmarket? That\'s the first question. And then secondly, can you tell us where we are with regards to Vantage in terms of the optimization of that solution, and when you would feel really good about pushing that? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the answer on the Workforce Now question is, about three or four months ago because I think Jan just alluded to that that we\'ve kind of tilted our focus now more towards new logo growth and new share from kind of the traditional approach of – doesn\'t mean we won\'t take additional modules and incremental business. But this is a fairly significant change from a sales force mentality standpoint where we were for several years focused on upgrades and on incremental sales of other modules to the existing client base as we upgraded them combined with selling something called ACA, which to some extent was a significant tailwind. So we\'re moving into a different environment. Luckily, we have other tailwinds like great products like you just mentioned with Workforce Now, and we can see, for example, our client satisfaction scores improving. We can see our client retention scores on our strategic platform being very, very high, higher than we\'ve had overall for the midmarket historically. So there\'s a lot of positive signs that we want to step on the accelerator and proactively sell our solution just as you mentioned. And I think we kind of got that religion, if you will, I don\'t know four to six months ago. And we\'ve been retooling, right, in terms of – I think Jan alluded to channels. I think if we\'re going to go after incremental new logos, not just add-on business that requires channel partnerships. And I think there\'s a lot of effort underway to build the same kind of success we have in our downmarket now with our midmarket channel partners. And so, the answer is, we\'re on that and we believe that, that will get traction over time. On the question about Vantage, Vantage continues to do quite well. And there, again, our satisfaction scores, for implementation have improved dramatically over the last several quarters as we invested in that process of the implementation process. I think we have like almost 350 live clients, versus I think we were at 220 at the beginning of the fiscal year. We have I think 500 sold, so we have a decent pipeline that needs to be implemented. And I don\'t mean pipeline. Those are actually signed contracts, 500 signed contracts. And so, we feel pretty good about our Vantage platform. I think it compares really well and competes very well with our upmarket competitors. But you all see the same thing we see. It\'s a very competitive environment in the upmarket and there are a lot of solutions. But we like what we have, and I think we\'re competing very effectively. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. And next a quick follow-up. With regards to the dual service platforms, do you still think that by the end of calendar 2018 you\'ll have completed that transition to the new service platforms? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. You\'re never complete on operations, Mark, but the majority of our work is actually this fiscal year and next fiscal year. So in next fiscal year I\'d still anticipate some dual ops. We haven\'t determined what that will be specifically, but there is still transitioning happening, but the vast majority relative to those three new locations and the two existing ones should be completed in 2018. But our service strategy is obviously organic and evolving and we\'re going to continue to drive improvements, but 2018 is a big year still for us. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Just two quick clarifications. Just on the retention. Do we know where these clients are going? Are they bringing it in-house, the service? Just curious. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. The sources of our business and the sources of our losses is something that we track. And both have very similar dynamics. It\'s a fragmented and there\'s no clear trend to it, and so they go to a variety of different targets. Some in the ERP space, some to our traditional competitors, some to other solutions, so it is a wide range. Some is driven by their M&A activity, moving to on (1:03:41). So the loss reasons and their targets is varied as the sources of our businesses are varied and as a consequence we feel the competitive dynamic has not fundamentally changed as we observe it. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And we did look at that. I happened to look at it last night. I asked for a little more detail in terms of our upmarket losses and unfortunately I didn\'t compare the same "top losses" to last year third quarter top losses, but when we looked at this year\'s third quarter losses, there were a couple that went back in-house. That we\'re using, for example, our COS solution, which is our BPO solution upmarket, and I guess they decided to go back and rebuild internal capabilities and use their internal technology. But I think Jan described it well, because I mean we sound elusive when we give you that answer, but it\'s really all over the board. And maybe that\'s because of our size because again, and just to continue to emphasize some of our competitors would have a different story just because of the differences potentially in terms of size. But in our case, it would almost be easier if we had one specific place or one specific reason, but it\'s not that way, neither in the upmarket nor for ADP overall. So there\'s no discernible pattern across – even in the place where we had the concentration of losses this quarter, we can\'t see discernible pattern. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. No, that\'s helpful. And then, the other clarification is just on an environment where you guys are, let\'s say, seeing slower revenue growth. Can you still get operating leverage and increase operating margins? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, yes. And that\'s fully our intention. So obviously, it\'s much easier to get operating leverage and margin improvement when you\'re growing revenues faster. But we are who we are. So we know ourselves very well, and we know that we\'re a $12 billion-plus company. And so we are happy with 7% to 9% revenue growth. And it\'s easier to get margin when you\'re at 9%. Like when you back out disposition that we had with that AdvancedMD business, we were almost getting close to 10% revenue growth at one point. Now we\'re excluding, again, the dispositions this year, we\'re probably closer to 7% or so in terms of our revenue growth. And the reality is that it\'s harder. But we\'re a very disciplined company. And so, for example, you can see our head count growth for our own internal resources slowing down slightly, despite the fact that we\'re still investing in our sales organization, because we have lower volumes. And so we know that, we get that. We\'ve been doing this for 68 years. And so we will adjust appropriately because we still want to deliver great service. Retention is the most important thing for us. And so we don\'t want to cut too much or we\'re not cut because this is a matter of slowing the growth of expense, not cutting expense. But we are slowing the growth of expense in certain areas as our revenue growth slows in order to be able to continue to drive operating efficiencies because we believe there\'s still opportunity for that. We have a lot of process improvement initiatives underway across the company because we believe that the complexity that we have historically had, the number of platforms, all the things that we\'ve been telling you about that we\'re trying to simplify, all those things are margin opportunity for us without affecting our associates and without affecting our clients. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Helpful. Thanks so much for the details. Operator Thank you. And we have time for one final question. And our last question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thank you. Hi, Carlos. Hi, Jan. I guess the first question is, if bookings growth recovers or as bookings growth recovers either because of easier comps or other factors, what is the relationship, the impact on the margins I would imagine would be negative. If you can talk about the specific quantification of that relationship, that would be helpful. And the other modeling question I have is with regards to the go forward tax rate? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I wish there was an easy answer to the question about margin and sales because back to, again, we want to be intellectually honest here. We had two or three years of very robust plus 12% sales growth, new business bookings growth and we drove margin improvement. So we clearly have the capability to drive margin. And some of that depends on the timing of when the investments and the expense go in. So as I think we\'ve mentioned, we\'ve I would say invested a little bit ahead of 2018 from a sales standpoint. If we had strong new bookings growth next year, there might be some incremental variable cost around commissions and so forth. But I\'m not saying it doesn\'t matter. It clearly matters. The math is very straightforward. But we have a lot of levers in our business and we make choices every day in order to balance our objectives, right? And one of our objectives continues to be margin improvement. But we also have an objective around growth. We have an objective around capital return. And we balance all of those things and I think try to do the right thing for our shareholders and our stakeholders. So I guess, the short answer is, we have the ability, I think, to drive margin when new bookings recover. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And on the tax rate, Ashwin, this quarter was onetime unanticipated strong outcome relative to our tax strategies of the R&D credits. So this quarter is not a regular quarter, it was a onetime effect and so we\'re going to be returning to our – well, that said, we\'re not giving guidance for next year. But it\'s certainly not going to be at the level that you saw in the third quarter. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Got it. And the third question I have for you Carlos and Jan is really, as you reflect back on how this year sort of transpired and you think about the operating plan for next year, which you\'re in the process of doing. How does that affect, how you go about doing the operating plan, the fact that you\'re considering and so on? If you can kind of walk through the process, what changes, what doesn\'t change? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that, frankly, the things that we look at and the things we do, many of them, we learn every day. Like, Jan and I are learning every year and every day in our current jobs, and we\'ve learned from our predecessors for many years, and I think this company has a lot of deep experience and knowledge about economic cycles and about how we manage our sales force, et cetera. So we, frankly, would make changes around the edges. But we\'re very consistent in terms of the way we approach things. And so one of our objectives for 2018 is this is the kind of experience and environment that would lead you to be overly conservative. And we want to be very careful about that. And that\'s why we haven\'t "slashed" expenses or sales investment because we just don\'t see the sign that that is the appropriate move right now. And so in a strange way, part of our challenge for 2018 will be to not allow ourselves to become overly conservative because we want to take advantage of the market opportunity that we have in front of us. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. The tenets translate into what you have heard. Our belief that our core strategic platforms need to be funded and need to be innovative. So we have a belief in our core capability to develop those products. And we continue as we had in a prior question, our belief that the service alignment initiative is fundamentally positive for our business outlook going forward. So we need to continue to drive the execution of those core strategic initiatives, and we continue to believe that our sales force has opportunity to execute and we will be funding those appropriately. So those may be the core tenets kind of really executing around the strategy that we have laid out for the last few years, also on 2018 is a fair assumption to make. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Okay. Thank you guys. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a couple of quick closing remarks. Obviously, we acknowledge we had a very challenging quarter. But I think you can also tell from our tone that we still have a lot of confidence in our business model and in our continued ability, not just to grow our business but also to drive operational efficiencies. You probably also can tell that, in particular, I\'m hopeful and optimistic that the continuing labor markets are going to continue to drive value in our HCM solutions for the market. So I think the economic cycle and the tightened labor markets I\'m hoping will help us as we try to reengage our sales growth and our revenue growth. And I think as Jan just mentioned, we\'re going to continue to make the investments in our innovation and simplification efforts because we believe they\'re yielding the right kinds of results. We\'re going to continue to align our service model, so the strategic alignment initiative I think continues to move forward and I think is on plan. And as you also heard, we\'re going to continue to expand our distribution channels because we\'ve shown a historical ability to create opportunities and use our distribution channel to grow the company, which is ultimately our objective. And so with that, I thank you for joining the call and I thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference.

We will take our first question from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. Good morning. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good morning. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Last quarter – I\'m thinking of it as the December quarter – you showed an improvement in client retention, I believe, 10 basis points; in this quarter, the March quarter, down 170 basis points. What was the major change between the December quarter and the March quarter that led to that decline in client revenue retention? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think as we mentioned, I think, in our opening comments, it was concentrated in our legacy platforms in the midmarket and in the upmarket. It was particularly skewed towards the upmarket this quarter. Some of the losses, as you know, we don\'t provide guidance. And in the December quarter, we wouldn\'t have talked about forward-looking retention. But some of the deterioration that we experienced in the quarter was anticipated as a result of some known large losses. We typically have reasonable amount of visibility, sometimes several quarters, if not a year or more, for very large clients when they are moving off of one of our solutions. But I guess the core message we are trying to deliver in our comments is that it continues to be concentrated in our legacy platforms. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. And just as a quick follow-up, it would seem that the decline in new bookings this year and some of the pressure on client revenue retention would be more consequential for fiscal 2018 given the way your revenue model works. Can you give us some preliminary thoughts about fiscal 2018 based on the retention trends and the booking trends you\'re seeing in FY 2017? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think you\'re right about the way the math works for our business. And I think that\'s why Jan was very clear in kind of reaffirming our guidance for, obviously, the rest of the year, because we\'re so far into the year that these variations and retention in sales have very low impact on the current next quarter and even maybe one quarter after that. But clearly, going forward, for the next fiscal year, it does roll into the math in terms of that waterfall chart that we\'ve shared with you. As you know, we don\'t provide guidance for fiscal year 2018 until our August call. So we\'re really in the middle of our operating plan process and we\'ll obviously have better information then in terms of how that waterfall chart exactly falls through in terms of the various factors that impact our revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that\'s true. But, David, you\'re mathematically correct that our new business bookings get implemented and turn into revenue after six months approximately and so some of the impact of our lower retention and lower sales will be seen in the revenue growth next year, as you roll it forward. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just the first one, if I heard you correctly, it sounded like the midmarket client migrations have been pushed out by two quarters. The question, I guess, is why have you pushed that out? And then expanding on that a little bit further, as you\'re starting, it sounds like with the upmarket – how has what you\'ve seen in midmarket colored your expectations and how you are going to approach the upmarket? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think, you\'re right about the timing that we were hoping that we would be done. I think our wording was that we would be done somewhere around the end of this fiscal year. And so, now we\'re saying by the end of the calendar year. Realistically, we really don\'t do migrations in November and December because we have year-end and a lot of activities going on. So it\'s really a few months and its a few clients or a few thousand clients, because in the midmarket, we\'re talking about clients in the thousands. And just as a reminder, there were tens of thousands. I think the total number of client migrations was somewhere around 50,000 or 60,000 clients. And so what we\'re talking about is, I would say, a couple of thousand stragglers that we felt, in order to just meet an artificial deadline wasn\'t worth. We learned our lesson, I think, a year-and-a-half ago around when we had to accelerate, in some cases we were forced to accelerate migrations as a result of ACA to get clients on our new platform in order to be able to give them that solution. We learned through that process that you want to really truly upgrade the clients and have them feel that it\'s an upgrade, not a forced march or a negative experience. And so we\'re just focused on making sure that it\'s the right kind of experience and we felt like a couple of thousand clients falling over from one fiscal year to the other is really not that big of a deal in our minds. And I think it\'s the right thing to do. And I think, to answer your question about how that experience colors our approach in the upmarket, again, I think we learned some lessons in terms of making sure that we do things at the proper pace, and that we do it in partnership with our clients. And I think that becomes much more important in the upmarket where it\'s much more complex, and clients have, in many cases, provide a lot of their own internal resources in order to make a migration happen. In the small market, when we did those migrations, there was very little effort and very little need for clients to be involved. In the midmarket, there was a little bit more effort and a little more involvement by the clients. And in the upmarket, there\'s quite a lot of involvement. And hence, it has to be much more carefully planned and, hence, you\'re probably hearing from us that it\'s going to be a longer process in terms of getting those upgrades completed. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Then just a follow-up, as you\'ve had a little more time in the new service delivery geographies, how was the ability to find talent then? How is it compared to your expectations for shifting to those locations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think it\'s fair to say that we are – and again, we\'re early in our goals here. But really, we\'re on track. So we\'re actually quite pleased. We\'ve got several thousand people already hired in our new locations in Orlando, in Maitland, which is near Orlando; in Norfolk, Virginia; and we\'re already hiring also in Tempe. And it is in addition to Augusta and El Paso where we already had two strategic locations. And we have a couple of other key locations, but those are the ones that we\'ve been talking the most about regarding our strategic alignment initiative. So I\'d say we\'re pleased with the talent, we\'re pleased with the pace. I think we\'re on plan in terms of the number of people we were intending to hire. We\'re on plan in terms of the wage levels and the quality of the talent. I have obviously visited, and I think Jan, we\'ve all visited these locations. In fact, we had a very large associate town hall meeting in our Norfolk, Virginia location. And it may be a honeymoon phase but it\'s an incredibly energetic environment. People are very positive and very bullish on ADP. I think we\'re considered a great employer in the markets that we are entering. And we\'ve got a lot of help from other parts of the organization getting these folks trained and ready to be able to actually deliver service, and in some cases they obviously already are. And that\'s why we have some of these dual operations cost that Jan has referred to a couple of times, because we\'re trying to make sure that we do this in a very careful and methodical way. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning. Thanks as always for all the disclosure. Just a couple of questions. Just on the pricing front, on successfully migrating clients to the new strategic platforms, any surprises there? Did that contribute at all to the bookings forecast? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just to be clear, when we migrate our clients, the migration itself is not counting as a new business booking because business bookings account only incremental recurring revenue that we report. So the migration is generally cost-neutral to our clients, and they have enhanced feature functionality with a new product that they get. In the process, clients continue to make buying decisions and buy incremental modules as they do, and we have seen that trend continue in particular in the midmarket. But the actual migration is revenue-neutral, as we approach it, and that will be the same for all upmarket clients. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Thanks for that clarification. I wasn\'t sure if the change might get captured in the (24:26) business bookings. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. So the change – if a client buys more, I don\'t have the most recent statistics here, but I think the trends continue that a number of clients purchases incremental modules as they see the power of the integrated platform. And so there is some slight revenue uptick that we do see for the clients who choose it and only that incremental revenue would be reflected. But it would be immaterial for the new business bookings number in total. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. One more quick follow-up. I know Jan because you\'ve been sort of, I guess, signaling or suggesting that some of these things could happen with ACA. But I\'m just curious, just looking back now, is some of the reduction in this bookings outlook – is there a way to quantify how much might be related to the weak follow-through on ACA module sales and the related tough comp on ACA modules versus maybe a pull-forward of broader payroll HCM sales related to ACA? Do you follow my question? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I do. And I think that it is – as I think we\'ve been trying to signal for, I think, probably three years if you go back to my notes, it\'s very hard because we\'re obviously in uncharted territories, because we were in something completely new. And it was a very comprehensive regulatory framework that required a lot of information from HR platforms, payroll platforms, benefit platforms, et cetera. And when you look back, we had two years of more than 12% new business bookings growth. And this is why we were cautious all along because that is a little strong. We were happy with it and we take it. It\'s good for our shareholders. It\'s good for ADP. It\'s good for our revenues. But it definitely felt like a fairly significant tailwind. And I think, in hindsight, it was obviously a big tailwind. Now, what has now added, I think, potentially to that pressure, which again we can\'t quantify scientifically is that we have, I think, a different environment politically that\'s creating some uncertainty, that certainly has impacted our new business bookings. We just can\'t put our finger on exactly to what extent. So as an example, we knew we had a grow-over issue just for ACA itself because we had already sold 50% of our addressable client base. But we did have some planned sales of ACA this year. And even though we\'ve gotten some, it\'s significantly lower than plan, which is not surprising given the headlines and the frequent votes on repeal and replace of ACA. And so I think that\'s a second factor that I think was not certainly anticipated as we entered into this fiscal year in terms of our planning process. We knew we had to grow over the mathematical grow-over issue. Now we have what I would call the political issue. And then the third one that you mentioned, which again, is very hard for us to put our finger on, but I think you\'re onto something because we experienced the same thing back when we had the Y2K phenomenon in year 2000, where you do have some amount of pull forward, if you will, of business because we\'ve seen this particularly on some of our wins last year from ERPs were quite high and elevated. And I think some of that, it appears, with the benefit of hindsight is, people on kind of older legacy technology trying to find a new solution for ACA. And by the way, some of that happened to us. So as we mentioned, before we think some of our retention issues last year may have been related to the same factor of people kind of just out looking for new solutions as a result of what I would call an event, which is a significant event called ACA. So I think all three things are a factor. We really wish we could put our finger on exactly how much each one is accountable. But unfortunately, we can\'t. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. Thanks so much for the insights. It\'s helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to follow-up on the prior question. On the new bookings weakness you\'re seeing and specifically the revision to guidance. Obviously, going from flat to down 5% for the full year. I think you had talked the last quarter about seeing confidence in improving bookings rates as you head through the end of the year. I guess, maybe you could talk anecdotally about what changed from three months ago to today in terms of specific client conversations you\'re having, is it simply the regulatory environment, uncertainty, seizing things up in terms of purchasing decisions? And then if you got any color on what clients are telling you about what they have to see to get more confidence to book? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think that a couple of comments and maybe Jan can add in terms of his observations. We\'ve obviously been meeting frequently with our sales leaders, and I\'ve been going around sales meetings trying to get to put my finger on the pulse. And it doesn\'t appear that it\'s the economy, because we have very robust and strong results in our downmarket. Our PEO is still doing well. Our MNC business had a great quarter. A lot of the channels that we sell through small business like our Insurance Services products and our Retirement Services products are also doing quite well. So it\'s really not an across-the-board weakness. It does appear to be concentrated in places where we had the ACA phenomenon, if you will. And then how much of it is related to just the grow-over itself versus uncertainty about the political environment, and the fact that the people maybe are sitting and waiting. We do have some information around our pipeline, which is not the same as bookings. So bookings are bookings, and we are very clear about how we count revenues. And I think Jan just went through the math. But we do have pipeline reports like any sales force would have pipeline reports. And in our midmarket and our upmarket, we feel pretty good like we did last quarter about our pipeline. So if we say we feel pretty good and the sales are not materializing, that can only lead to only one conclusion, which is the decision-making is getting elongated or slowing. And we can\'t quite put our finger on why, but that\'s exactly the math is showing versus our pipeline right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think the only thing, Jim, just keep in mind our new guidance is down 5% to 7%, is our expected new business bookings guidance and I think Carlos captured it. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Understand. And then maybe as a follow-up. Can you maybe just talk about the regulatory environment changes and what impact that could have on the PEO business? And specifically, what\'s your confidence level in that PEO business kind of sustaining double-digit growth for the foreseeable future? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good question. Actually, let me finish also. I think you mentioned about like tone in the sales force. And one of the kind of surprising things for me at least is the tone in the sales force is still very positive. Like, we\'ve done some things to try to "encourage people not to throw in the towel" because this is another factor that I have to worry about, right, that we are close to our end of our fiscal year, and the way our incentive systems work, there\'s a big incentive when you\'re exceeding plan to over exceed it. And, likewise, there\'s a bit of an incentive to throw in the towel, if you will, if you\'re having a bad year. So we\'ve done some things to try to – and that may be why the sales forces still remains upbeat, or maybe because they think these issues are transitory. It\'s very, again, hard to put a scientific answer on it. But it feels positive in terms of the tone in the sales force. On the question about PEO and the regulatory environment, I think I mentioned multiple times also in the PEO over the last couple of years that it felt like we were getting some tailwind as a result of ACA, if for no other reason because it was creating conversation opportunities, right. Because people are looking for a solution and they\'re looking at maybe different alternatives and someone is able to talk to them about the PEO, and I think it\'s compelling value proposition they\'re able to close the business. So I would put the PEO in the same category that we were watching, if you will. It\'s not quite the same in the sense that many of the clients in the PEO are not necessarily buying only ACA. And we\'re not rushing to make a decision of that magnitude only because of ACA. So I think there\'s a subtle but important difference. So I\'m not convinced and we certainly aren\'t seeing it in the numbers yet that the PEO will have the same kind of difficulties, if you will, growing over. But it\'s definitely a more difficult sales environment for the PEO. But having said that, just again we\'ve said this multiple times that the PEO has grown double-digits for, I think, its 17 years now. And so it\'s just a very compelling value proposition. And if, for example, there are changes in the regulatory landscape, some parts of our business may be affected like our direct ACA product, if the entire thing gets repealed and the whole thing goes away, that would not be good news for that part of the business. But, as we know now from what we\'re hearing of what\'s growing through Congress, there\'s not going to be a complete repeal. There\'s going to be some kind of new framework. Those types of new frameworks are always good for the PEO because they intend to be more state-based regulation, which is what the PEO is really good at and what small companies are not very good at in having to deal with. And so I think that I would remain generally optimistic and positive – more optimistic and more positive about the PEO. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is open. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first, just wanted to start off, I know you just touched on this a little bit, but a little more color would be helpful. I mean, I understand why businesses are holding off with regards to ACA solutions, just given the uncertainties that you mentioned around healthcare in the U.S. as a whole. But at the end of the day, the law is the law, right. So kind of like at what point, if reform keeps being delayed, do you think employers will start to demand the solutions you\'re offering around ACA and just make other buying decisions in general that they may have been holding off because of the uncertainty? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We were hoping that that would happen two weeks ago or three weeks ago when President said that he was done with it and that we\'re moving on to tax reform. And unfortunately, that was not – it appears not to have been the case. So I think we\'re watching the same news you\'re watching. We do have obviously some access to and some information that we get from people in Washington about what\'s happening on the Hill and the regulation and so forth. But we have kind of similar information to what everyone else has. And these things always, when you\'re in the middle of them, feel like your feet are in cement. And that\'s how it feels like to us right now. It\'s very frustrating but these things pass. We will look back a year or two from now and there will either be the existing ACA or some other version or some more complicated state regime or complex regulatory framework at the state level. And we\'ll hopefully be looking back and seeing this as yet another opportunity for ADP to shine and to help our clients. But right now, it is what it is, and it doesn\'t feel great. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Thanks. And then just to follow up, when you think about the slide that you guys put out, just your long-term growth driver, the 7% to 9% that you think of the longer term and I think you have like a 14% to 15% new business bookings and 7% to 8% reduction from client losses. Just how does that math change given the bookings guidance that you\'re seeing right now? And I know 2018 is a little early, but just any color you can give us on how to think about how that 7% to 9% growth might be impacted for fiscal 2018? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. Our longer-term expectations for organic growth is 7% to 9%, as you correctly quoted. And it\'s driven by growth of new business bookings in the range of 8% to 10% growth. And it always was meant to cover multiple year type of cycle elongated and it was not a commitment obviously, as you see realistically – not a commitment to perform every single fiscal year. So we are not updating our long-term growth outlook at this point in time. But, clearly, our new business bookings have fallen a little bit behind, but relative to a three- or four-year cycle of new business bookings, we still feel good about our growth opportunities. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just want to understand the bookings a little bit more. So a two-part question, part math, part more subjective. So the math is just to get the full-year guidance. Seems like you\'re implying potentially further deterioration in the fourth quarter, unless maybe the weighting from the third quarter is disproportionate, so maybe some clarification there. And then the second part of that is maybe you can just talk about the cadence exiting the selling season and into April? Carlos, you already talked a little bit about hoping to see some change as of two weeks ago but not seeing it but maybe just a little bit more color. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think you\'re right that the third quarter is disproportionate. So we have a lot of – disproportionate number of dollar sales in the third quarter compared to the entire year. And that\'s just the way the seasonality has always worked. So the fourth quarter would not be materially different in terms of the momentum or this kind of the 5% to 7% down range. It\'s in that ballpark. So there is really no real news I think there. I think the cadence in terms of the exit for the – the one thing that we\'re grappling with is, obviously, we have the realities, right, of the political environment and we\'re hoping that there will be resolution here relatively soon. Our fiscal year, obviously, starts on July 1. We\'re hoping to have some kind of – we thought two, three weeks ago, we had clarity. So we\'re hoping that we get that behind us and we get some clarity, because we have lots of other products. We have lots of other parts of our business that are performing well. And we just want to get on with it, right, and be able to continue to sell the other suite of products that we have available both in the midmarket and also in the upmarket. So I think, as I mentioned before, it feels like exiting the year, our pipelines are robust. It feels like the tone and the confidence in the sales force is high. But the results are the results. And I think Jan and I live in a world of reality, not in the world of make-believe. And so we\'re being cautious and careful, but it\'s hard not to be optimistic because the economy is picking up it feels like. The labor markets are tightening. And we have some very compelling value propositions in that kind of environment where employers now are going to be "engaging" in a war for talent again, which we haven\'t seen. We forget that 10 years ago there was real issue in terms of finding people. And we benefited back then from that kind of environment in terms of our HCM solutions, and we\'re hoping that we\'re entering a period here where all of our solutions, the entire suite becomes very compelling as clients become focused on attracting people and holding onto the people that they have. And we see all kinds of metrics in our own numbers and in the government data around higher voluntary turnover, higher wage growth, lots of signals that the labor markets are tightening. And I think our value propositions are very compelling in that kind of environment. So we just want to get this uncertainty and these delays and this slow decision-making behind us so that we can get on to the business. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe just... Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ...a little comment to this on the outlook, which Carlos described correctly kind of roughly in line with fourth quarter and the full-year guidance. But we\'ll also continue to put our dollars where our statements are and the investments into the sales force, the incentives that we\'re bringing out to get the sales force ready, and the hiring and preparing for growth in the next year are actually fully underway and have actually to some degree impacted our third quarter and fourth quarter results because we believe we have that opportunity going forward. So we\'re preparing for growth in the future. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. And then just a question on retention. I just wanted to clarify. So it sounded like some of the higher attrition was in the upmarket and was partly related to migration. But at the same time, you\'re taking a more measured pace with your migration relative to what you do with Workforce Now. So just trying to square that and see maybe where any surprises came versus expectations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Maybe one is connected to the other and maybe not. Because I think the reality is that the variability and I think we\'re very sensitive now obviously to retention for all the right reasons because we went through a really difficult last year, but we\'ve had variability in our retention forever at ADP because it\'s a different metric than our other metrics and it can be volatile. And as an example, in the upmarket, you can have one or two large clients that can actually move that number – one or two clients in the upmarket that can move the number for the upmarket and for ADP. And you saw a little bit of that in the first quarter where we lost that large government contract and the business that we ended up selling or were in the process of selling that had a material impact on our overall retention for the first quarter. So this wasn\'t one large client like that, but it was a handful of clients. And so our upmarket business is a little less than 20% of our overall revenue, so just to kind of put things in context and it\'s 2,000 to 3,000 clients. And a couple, literally, three, four client losses in a particular quarter can really move the number. So I was just trying to help kind of frame the discussion because at least for now I\'m not ready to conceive that we have a permanent – we don\'t talk about forward guidance on retention, but this is a third quarter issue for now. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. All right. One more on the topic of the day, retention. So the upmarket dynamic you\'re describing, I guess, does feel like it\'s a little bit new. Is there a change in the competitive landscape in the upmarket? Or is there anything you can identify that triggered I guess this handful of clients this quarter? Or is it just somewhat anomalous? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s a good question. And I think that you\'d be generally I think right that despite the fact that we do have volatility across quarters, we have generally not paid a lot of attention to it because over the course of kind of rolling 12 months or even in terms of years, calendar years or even fiscal years, our retention in the upmarket has been pretty stable. I mean it\'s a sticky business. It doesn\'t change a whole lot. So I\'d say this quarter was – I\'d say it\'s fair that it\'s a little bit anomalous. And I think the answer to your other part of question; we don\'t see it as being related to any change in the competitive environment. Now, as always, in two to three years or in two to three quarters, I may be singing a different tune, but we have a lot of data around the reasons for the losses, what platform the losses were on, were they new technology, old technology, and what types of product the client had. And I think when we put all that information together, which Jan and I, obviously, spent a lot of time anticipating this being one of the topics of the day, we\'ve spent a lot of time on this issue and looked at the names of the clients, who they are, what platforms they were on, and we don\'t see any change in the competitive environment. I think we\'ve said before that there isn\'t any one competitor that causes us a majority of our losses, and likewise there isn\'t any one competitor where we take the majority of our business from. It\'s spread out all over the landscape and it remains that way. For some of our competitors that might be different because of their size where they may have a heavy concentration of taking clients from one particular company. In our case, that is not the case. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe a tiny bit of further detail, Lisa, is when we look at our competitive position against this multitude of competitors in the quarter, some competitive positions have improved and some have not. And that is a fairly typical thing we see each of these competitors evolving quarter-by-quarter up and down. So when we say the general competitive dynamic we feel has not changed, it\'s rooted in this analysis, and we see in some cases we have improved and some cases we have not. So it\'s a mixed bag obviously, but we believe it hasn\'t changed. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think I didn\'t maybe answer directly your question about how does this square with our upgrade or migrations strategy. And I think the things really are somewhat connected in maybe an odd way that we think that because we know what clients we lost and what platforms they were on that it makes it even more compelling for us to move our clients onto our newer technologies. On the other hand, we know that these movements are complex and that the clients need to help us and they need to be involved, they need to cooperate. And so finding the right clients in the right place at the right time is just different than it was in the midmarket and in the down market. But it think it heightens our confidence that it\'s the right thing to do over time. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. And then I guess the follow-up, as we\'ve been living with you through the Workforce Now migrations in the midmarket, I know you\'ve consistently said that the retention levels are higher on the migrated clients and so there\'s sort of this nirvana we are going to get to when the migrations are done where retention should naturally go back up. Are we though now facing a more protracted period in the upmarket kind of going to the same thing? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the nirvana, it does from what Jan and I were looking at just over the last couple of days, their retention rates on our current version Workforce Now strategic platform are extremely high, and we\'re very happy with them and we have a lot of volume on it already. So that feels like it worked out the way we had hoped and we had anticipated. And with now the down-market on our new strategic platform with potential rates that frankly have improved dramatically over the last couple years and with our Workforce Now migrations being completed by the end of this calendar year and with 20% of our base remaining in the upmarket, we\'re feeling good about where we are. But the answer to your question is, yes, we have a protracted migration effort in the upmarket. It\'s the right thing to do. We\'re going to do it, and we\'re going to do it as well as we can and as quickly as we can without causing damage and disruption to our clients. But we\'re in a very different position from where we were four or five years ago when we had 10% of our clients on our strategic platforms that are version-less in cloud where there is no further migration and there is no further disruption. So it\'s a very, very different place and it hasn\'t felt good getting here but it feels pretty good now. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. Maybe quickly just on a more positive note. I know you\'ve had the reporting and benchmarking modules out in the market now at least for a few months. How are they doing? How is the uptake? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s going well. Again, that\'s another one back to the discussion about what\'s happening with the labor markets and the economy in general. Those are products that are useful no matter what, but in the kind of environment that we\'re entering into like helping people make sure that they\'re paying people the right amounts, that they know where their turnover is in comparison to benchmarks, that type of information is very, very useful to an HR leader or to a CEO in making good people decisions on a go-forward basis. So that\'s another example of something that the conversations for the last two or three years were about ACA. I think the conversations for the next two or three years are going to be about what\'s happening with your workforce, what\'s the turnover rate, how are you paying people. And I think these benchmark and analytics tools are going to facilitate those discussions, and hopefully, those sales because those are conversation openers or starters in order to convince clients to come to our product suite, which is I think unique in a sense that it has these data and analytics benchmarks. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Terrific. Thank you. Thanks for all the transparency as usual. Operator Thank you. And our next question will come from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you so much. A few times you mentioned the uncertainty and you thought it might have dissipated a few weeks ago when we had a little bit more clarity on ACA. Is the client uncertainty and the elongated decision-making you think it\'s solely related to ACA issues? Are there just other things going on in the current environment that clients are worried about? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Again, I\'ll just say one more time. It\'s impossible for us. We don\'t really have like a chart that kind of follows that. So this is really more on intuition, and I\'ll let Jan comment as well. But it\'s not just ACA that\'s creating uncertainty. I think the administration has asked the Labor Department to review the overtime rules, for example, that were about to be issued. I think there were pay equity rules that were coming out around EEOC reporting that are now under review as well. The fiduciary rule, which was intended to go through the – which would have affected our Retirement Services business has also been put under review. And so I think there are pockets of uncertainty in addition to ACA. And some of them happened to be related to our core business, which is HCM. And so if you\'re selling, for example, an ERP suite, some of that uncertainty may not really affect that decision-making. But if we were involved in a sales process where you had a large hourly workforce and many of them – sorry, a large salaried workforce because of the new rules was going to now be hourly and those hours needed to be tracked and you needed to be in compliance with the FLSA, that sales cycle has probably been elongated as a client stops and goes back to focusing on whatever they were focusing on before that trigger event. So I think there are a few other things that are probably not helpful, but again, it\'s hard for us to put a specific measure on each one of them. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. I understand and I appreciate the color. And then just one, I guess, numbers or model-related question. When do we anniversary the bump in bookings from all the ACA-driven business? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, next fiscal year, we are clearly half – still a little bit of grow-over but not that material. So next year should be a clean year relative to the ACA-related grow-over. Just a further clarification, we have tried to illustrate this a few times. With the ACA core module that we have sold came off an incremental fuller bundled sales that particularly included benefit administration module. So the impact of the Affordable Care Act have been broader than the direct impact of the ACA-related sales, which makes it a little bit harder to predict. And as a consequence, our clients (54:35) typically provides ADP-wide about 50% of our incremental new business bookings, however, come from selling more to existing clients. And that dynamic has now changed because we have fuller bundles now in particular in the midmarket. And so we started to transition to drive new logo growth in the midmarket and those channels have to readjust a little bit as a consequence of the ACA surge that has driven a more complete bundle in particular in the midmarket. So that transition is still present obviously next year, but we feel that we have great strategies in place to replace basically that up-sell strategy with a more aggressive new logo sales. And as we have clarified, it is a disappointing quarter, but despite our down guidance for new business booking sale, it will still be our second highest sales year ever for ADP. So keep that in mind. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. This is actually Jay Hanna on for Gary today. Kind of going off that last comment, going forward, given the struggles with the client retention this quarter and the now expected decline in bookings, should we expect an even greater spend on sales force additions going forward? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, it\'s funny you should mention that, because I think Jan I think did address and I\'ll let him if he wants to give more detail, which we probably don\'t because we\'re not giving FY 2018 guidance yet. But we\'re definitely not taking our foot off of the accelerator. So we obviously could change our minds a quarter or two from now, but our position right now is I think we mentioned it in Jan\'s comments, we\'re maintaining our investments in service, implementation, et cetera. And in some cases we\'ve actually accelerated or increased some of our investments. And I think in the sales organization is a place where I would say we\'ve added expense. And the irony is that the underlying sales expense gets helped by weaker sales because our commissions are lower and so forth, but there\'s a lot of things that go into that sales expense bucket, including head count cost and commissions. And so it\'s safe to say that our commission expense and our variable expense is helping us from a cost standpoint. But instead of taking that all to the bottom line, we have chosen to invest because, again, we believe our story which is that nothing fundamentally has changed in the economy, which is typically what really affects ADP, which by the way affects us less than most because of the nature of our business model. But if we saw a recession coming or a slowdown coming, we would have to start thinking hard about our expense levels. And that\'s not where we are right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a quick reminder, as one of the advantages of ADP is that we serve such a broad range of segments and markets in the U.S. and globally and multinational, and so as we had our challenges in the mid and upmarket, we continue to perform tremendously in the down-market, in the PEO, multinational. So there\'s a broad range of products that are gaining share and really driving success. So obviously, in that balance, our investments into sales signal our confidence for ultimate success in distribution. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of product-related questions. With regards to the higher ratings in terms of the G2 for Workforce Now, at what point do you start pivoting from migration of existing clients to proactively selling Workforce Now to clients that aren\'t currently utilizing ADP at all in the midmarket? That\'s the first question. And then secondly, can you tell us where we are with regards to Vantage in terms of the optimization of that solution, and when you would feel really good about pushing that? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the answer on the Workforce Now question is, about three or four months ago because I think Jan just alluded to that that we\'ve kind of tilted our focus now more towards new logo growth and new share from kind of the traditional approach of – doesn\'t mean we won\'t take additional modules and incremental business. But this is a fairly significant change from a sales force mentality standpoint where we were for several years focused on upgrades and on incremental sales of other modules to the existing client base as we upgraded them combined with selling something called ACA, which to some extent was a significant tailwind. So we\'re moving into a different environment. Luckily, we have other tailwinds like great products like you just mentioned with Workforce Now, and we can see, for example, our client satisfaction scores improving. We can see our client retention scores on our strategic platform being very, very high, higher than we\'ve had overall for the midmarket historically. So there\'s a lot of positive signs that we want to step on the accelerator and proactively sell our solution just as you mentioned. And I think we kind of got that religion, if you will, I don\'t know four to six months ago. And we\'ve been retooling, right, in terms of – I think Jan alluded to channels. I think if we\'re going to go after incremental new logos, not just add-on business that requires channel partnerships. And I think there\'s a lot of effort underway to build the same kind of success we have in our downmarket now with our midmarket channel partners. And so, the answer is, we\'re on that and we believe that, that will get traction over time. On the question about Vantage, Vantage continues to do quite well. And there, again, our satisfaction scores, for implementation have improved dramatically over the last several quarters as we invested in that process of the implementation process. I think we have like almost 350 live clients, versus I think we were at 220 at the beginning of the fiscal year. We have I think 500 sold, so we have a decent pipeline that needs to be implemented. And I don\'t mean pipeline. Those are actually signed contracts, 500 signed contracts. And so, we feel pretty good about our Vantage platform. I think it compares really well and competes very well with our upmarket competitors. But you all see the same thing we see. It\'s a very competitive environment in the upmarket and there are a lot of solutions. But we like what we have, and I think we\'re competing very effectively. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. And next a quick follow-up. With regards to the dual service platforms, do you still think that by the end of calendar 2018 you\'ll have completed that transition to the new service platforms? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. You\'re never complete on operations, Mark, but the majority of our work is actually this fiscal year and next fiscal year. So in next fiscal year I\'d still anticipate some dual ops. We haven\'t determined what that will be specifically, but there is still transitioning happening, but the vast majority relative to those three new locations and the two existing ones should be completed in 2018. But our service strategy is obviously organic and evolving and we\'re going to continue to drive improvements, but 2018 is a big year still for us. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Just two quick clarifications. Just on the retention. Do we know where these clients are going? Are they bringing it in-house, the service? Just curious. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. The sources of our business and the sources of our losses is something that we track. And both have very similar dynamics. It\'s a fragmented and there\'s no clear trend to it, and so they go to a variety of different targets. Some in the ERP space, some to our traditional competitors, some to other solutions, so it is a wide range. Some is driven by their M&A activity, moving to on (1:03:41). So the loss reasons and their targets is varied as the sources of our businesses are varied and as a consequence we feel the competitive dynamic has not fundamentally changed as we observe it. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And we did look at that. I happened to look at it last night. I asked for a little more detail in terms of our upmarket losses and unfortunately I didn\'t compare the same "top losses" to last year third quarter top losses, but when we looked at this year\'s third quarter losses, there were a couple that went back in-house. That we\'re using, for example, our COS solution, which is our BPO solution upmarket, and I guess they decided to go back and rebuild internal capabilities and use their internal technology. But I think Jan described it well, because I mean we sound elusive when we give you that answer, but it\'s really all over the board. And maybe that\'s because of our size because again, and just to continue to emphasize some of our competitors would have a different story just because of the differences potentially in terms of size. But in our case, it would almost be easier if we had one specific place or one specific reason, but it\'s not that way, neither in the upmarket nor for ADP overall. So there\'s no discernible pattern across – even in the place where we had the concentration of losses this quarter, we can\'t see discernible pattern. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. No, that\'s helpful. And then, the other clarification is just on an environment where you guys are, let\'s say, seeing slower revenue growth. Can you still get operating leverage and increase operating margins? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, yes. And that\'s fully our intention. So obviously, it\'s much easier to get operating leverage and margin improvement when you\'re growing revenues faster. But we are who we are. So we know ourselves very well, and we know that we\'re a $12 billion-plus company. And so we are happy with 7% to 9% revenue growth. And it\'s easier to get margin when you\'re at 9%. Like when you back out disposition that we had with that AdvancedMD business, we were almost getting close to 10% revenue growth at one point. Now we\'re excluding, again, the dispositions this year, we\'re probably closer to 7% or so in terms of our revenue growth. And the reality is that it\'s harder. But we\'re a very disciplined company. And so, for example, you can see our head count growth for our own internal resources slowing down slightly, despite the fact that we\'re still investing in our sales organization, because we have lower volumes. And so we know that, we get that. We\'ve been doing this for 68 years. And so we will adjust appropriately because we still want to deliver great service. Retention is the most important thing for us. And so we don\'t want to cut too much or we\'re not cut because this is a matter of slowing the growth of expense, not cutting expense. But we are slowing the growth of expense in certain areas as our revenue growth slows in order to be able to continue to drive operating efficiencies because we believe there\'s still opportunity for that. We have a lot of process improvement initiatives underway across the company because we believe that the complexity that we have historically had, the number of platforms, all the things that we\'ve been telling you about that we\'re trying to simplify, all those things are margin opportunity for us without affecting our associates and without affecting our clients. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Helpful. Thanks so much for the details. Operator Thank you. And we have time for one final question. And our last question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thank you. Hi, Carlos. Hi, Jan. I guess the first question is, if bookings growth recovers or as bookings growth recovers either because of easier comps or other factors, what is the relationship, the impact on the margins I would imagine would be negative. If you can talk about the specific quantification of that relationship, that would be helpful. And the other modeling question I have is with regards to the go forward tax rate? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I wish there was an easy answer to the question about margin and sales because back to, again, we want to be intellectually honest here. We had two or three years of very robust plus 12% sales growth, new business bookings growth and we drove margin improvement. So we clearly have the capability to drive margin. And some of that depends on the timing of when the investments and the expense go in. So as I think we\'ve mentioned, we\'ve I would say invested a little bit ahead of 2018 from a sales standpoint. If we had strong new bookings growth next year, there might be some incremental variable cost around commissions and so forth. But I\'m not saying it doesn\'t matter. It clearly matters. The math is very straightforward. But we have a lot of levers in our business and we make choices every day in order to balance our objectives, right? And one of our objectives continues to be margin improvement. But we also have an objective around growth. We have an objective around capital return. And we balance all of those things and I think try to do the right thing for our shareholders and our stakeholders. So I guess, the short answer is, we have the ability, I think, to drive margin when new bookings recover. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And on the tax rate, Ashwin, this quarter was onetime unanticipated strong outcome relative to our tax strategies of the R&D credits. So this quarter is not a regular quarter, it was a onetime effect and so we\'re going to be returning to our – well, that said, we\'re not giving guidance for next year. But it\'s certainly not going to be at the level that you saw in the third quarter. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Got it. And the third question I have for you Carlos and Jan is really, as you reflect back on how this year sort of transpired and you think about the operating plan for next year, which you\'re in the process of doing. How does that affect, how you go about doing the operating plan, the fact that you\'re considering and so on? If you can kind of walk through the process, what changes, what doesn\'t change? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that, frankly, the things that we look at and the things we do, many of them, we learn every day. Like, Jan and I are learning every year and every day in our current jobs, and we\'ve learned from our predecessors for many years, and I think this company has a lot of deep experience and knowledge about economic cycles and about how we manage our sales force, et cetera. So we, frankly, would make changes around the edges. But we\'re very consistent in terms of the way we approach things. And so one of our objectives for 2018 is this is the kind of experience and environment that would lead you to be overly conservative. And we want to be very careful about that. And that\'s why we haven\'t "slashed" expenses or sales investment because we just don\'t see the sign that that is the appropriate move right now. And so in a strange way, part of our challenge for 2018 will be to not allow ourselves to become overly conservative because we want to take advantage of the market opportunity that we have in front of us. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. The tenets translate into what you have heard. Our belief that our core strategic platforms need to be funded and need to be innovative. So we have a belief in our core capability to develop those products. And we continue as we had in a prior question, our belief that the service alignment initiative is fundamentally positive for our business outlook going forward. So we need to continue to drive the execution of those core strategic initiatives, and we continue to believe that our sales force has opportunity to execute and we will be funding those appropriately. So those may be the core tenets kind of really executing around the strategy that we have laid out for the last few years, also on 2018 is a fair assumption to make. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Okay. Thank you guys. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a couple of quick closing remarks. Obviously, we acknowledge we had a very challenging quarter. But I think you can also tell from our tone that we still have a lot of confidence in our business model and in our continued ability, not just to grow our business but also to drive operational efficiencies. You probably also can tell that, in particular, I\'m hopeful and optimistic that the continuing labor markets are going to continue to drive value in our HCM solutions for the market. So I think the economic cycle and the tightened labor markets I\'m hoping will help us as we try to reengage our sales growth and our revenue growth. And I think as Jan just mentioned, we\'re going to continue to make the investments in our innovation and simplification efforts because we believe they\'re yielding the right kinds of results. We\'re going to continue to align our service model, so the strategic alignment initiative I think continues to move forward and I think is on plan. And as you also heard, we\'re going to continue to expand our distribution channels because we\'ve shown a historical ability to create opportunities and use our distribution channel to grow the company, which is ultimately our objective. And so with that, I thank you for joining the call and I thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference.

We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, unless otherwise noted each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Amar. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks Dave. We’re after an impressive start with the new fiscal year with broad based strength across all subscription types and geographies. These types of results are increasing our confident in the acceptance of the subscription model and our ability to achieve our goals. There are several areas to highlight in Q1 including, we added a record 186,000 total subscriptions. Total ARR grew 20% at constant currency. Recurring revenue jumped to 90% of total revenue and we over-achieve on both our revenue and spend goal, leading to better than expected in EPS. As we’ve demonstrated over the past several quarters, we are executing well and making real progress on our two major initiatives, growing the lifetime customer value by moving customers to the subscription model and expanding our market opportunity with increasing adoption of our cloud based solutions. Now let’s dive to our Q1 performance a little more. Before I get too far, I want to note a change in our terminology. New model is now known simply as subscription plan to synchronize with our new revenue reporting terminology. Just like new model, subscription plan consists of product subscriptions and end-of-life subscriptions and cloud subscriptions. We added 233,000 subscription plan subs in Q1, which is even higher, there are seasonality strong fourth quarter of last year. Once more the net record 186,000 total subscription additions resulting from strength across all subscription plan types and a higher renewal rate for maintenance planned subs. One of the best signal with the health of our business with the strong demand for our core designing engineering product, which is reflected in impressive year-over-year growth of over 170% in product subscriptions even more pleasing was the strength in product subscriptions was broad based, with triple digit growth across all geographies and very strong growth in emerging markets. Once again, new customers represented about a third of our new product subscriptions for the quarter. These new customers come from a mix of market expansion, growing in emerging countries, unlicensed users and people who have been using an alternate design tool. Subscription plans starts also had a strong contribution from our new enterprise customers. I mentioned on last quarter's call that in Q4, we had signed up a record number of enterprise customers for our token base of consumption style EDAs, and that because of the way we count our subscriptions, we see the benefit to net new subscriptions in Q1 just as we did in the first quarter of last 2 fiscal years. These EDAs contributed a record 44,000 subscription additions in Q1 of this year, 10% more than Q1 of last year. EDAs with our large enterprise customers have been a very successful component of our transition leading to both increased subscriptions and account value while creating increased flexibility for our customers.  The third component of our subscription plan starts is our cloud products. This is the TAM expansion part of our business and we are building on our leadership in the cloud. Cloud subscription additions continue to show strong growth growing by over 4 times Q1 of last year, and these were driven by BIM 360, our BIM collaboration and construction management tool and closely followed by Fusion our cloud-based design and fabrication tool. In addition to brand new customers to our cloud products, we are also doing a lot of add on business with our existing cloud customers. A great example of this was a large Australian construction company which had already deployed over a 1000 seats of BIM 360. The company is now expanding the deployment of BIM 360 and integrating it into their project management system which has resulted in the purchase of an additional 3000 seats of BIM 360 by that customer. BIM 360 goes beyond a typical product sale and has allowed us to develop much more strategic relationships with [indiscernible] and other companies as we kept into this huge potential TAM of the construction market, the fee in AEC. Some of you may have seen that just last week there was a great story in the Wall Street Journal that highlighted that opportunity and prominently featured Autodesk. Fusion 360 is also expanding our market opportunity. We had a great Q1 win with a UK-based engineering firm that is choosing to replace Team Center with Fusion Lifecycle. This customer also purchased product design collection, which includes Fusion 360 which successfully completed against DSO and PPP solutions. The more people used fusion, the more they are reinforcing our believe that Fusion is a game changer that's driving the future of making things at the expense of our competition. Partially offsetting the growth in subscription plan subs was the expected decline in maintenance plant sales. However, maintenance planned subs declined less than what we experienced in Q4 through a combination of a higher renewal rate and a smaller pool of renewal opportunities. As we stated in the past, we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance plan subscriptions going forward. The rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions that come up for renewal, the renewal rate at the time and our ability to incest maintenance planned customers to switch over to EBAs or product subscriptions without maintenance to subscription program.  I’ll now turn it over to Andrew to provide more details on the great results we saw in Q1.  Andrew Anagnost Thanks, Amar. The strong growth in total subscription is fueling growth in ARR. Subscription plan ARR surged 105% on a constant currency basis and reflect the strong uptake of all our subscription plan offerings. Total ARR grew by over 100 million quarter-over-quarter and 20% over Q1 last year on a constant currency basis. And I’ll point out this 40% of our total ARR is now driven by [technical difficulty] that’s up from just 23% in Q1 last year and a clear indicator of significant progress we're making. When we accelerated the transition away perpetual licenses two years ago. We projected the subscription plan ARR with maintenance plan during this fiscal year and we are well on the way to making that happen. For the second consecutive quarter, we experience the small sequential increase in total ARPS, primarily driven by ARPS growth in product subscription. It's still a little too early to project what ARPS will grow sequentially in Q2 and ARPS is still sensitive to short-term shifts and term length, geo mix, product mix and promotions. Having said that, we remain confident that ARPS will be positively influence in the second half of the year by less discounting and promotions to our legacy users, as well as the impact of the maintenance and subscription program. Each quarter, the vast majority of the subscription plan subs are added through traditional maintenance. However, we continue to make meaningful progress in converting non-paying users into subscribers. In Q1, we added 26,000 product subscriptions to another successful promo target in our legacy users. The Q1 promo offer 30% discount on a three-year subscription is they turn in their old perpetual licenses. It's the same type of promo that added 28,000 subs in Q1 last year with 70% discount. We’re still finding that more than half of those particularly in the promo are turning in licenses seven years back or older. This is further reinforcing our view, that there are meaningful number of active users whose licenses are more than five years old and are interested in moving to latest software. They are continuing to be over 2 million of these legacy users that are actively using our all perpetual license. Overtime, we will convert a large portion of these users either through promotions like this, compelling new product introductions or traditional means as their product becomes increasingly update overtime, we’re beginning to see this happen already. The other large cohort non-paying users, the non-compliance or piracy based of roughly 12 million worldwide. We’ve made significant gains and being able to more accurately identify these non-compliance users and we’re just getting underway with systemically pursue convergence to subscription. Driving more users to subscription directly aligned with another one of our transition related initiatives to drive more business direct. Total direct revenue for the first quarter was 30% of total revenue, that's up from 25% in Q1 last year and just 19% two years ago. We continue to grow the volume of business with our large enterprise customers and we’re experiencing exceptional growth of over 300% with our e-store. We expect to continue to meaningfully growth both our direct to enterprise and our e-store business as we go forward. Now I'll close my section by talking a little bit more about the maintenance and subscription program, because it was easily the most asked about topics over the past quarters. At the end of the Q1, we had nearly 2 million maintenance planned customers and we're going to encourage these customers to move to product subscriptions. We'd like them to do so sooner rather than later as product subscription provides them the great value with increased flexibility support and access to our cloud products. Moving to single model makes the more sense and we'll immensely simplify our customer's transactions with Autodesk. The M2S kicks off with maintenance planned customers that come up for renewal starting on June 1 which is just a couple of weeks away. Along with greater value, loyalty pricing will be a big driver. As I discussed last quarter, all maintenance customers will be subject to a 5% price increase when they come up to renewal and they can choose to move to product subscription for a loyalty discounts of 60% less than the cost of a new product subscription and lots of pricing for the following two years. With this discount will decreased by 5% for each of the following 2 years, so the earlier customers wish the more they'll save. The maintenance planned customer can choose to stay on maintenance, but they will be subject to a 10% increase next year and 20% increase the year after that. As such, we believe that there will be a relatively small number of maintenance planned customers by the end of FY'20 and we'll be determining the best course of actions for the subsequent renewal periods. Since we announce this program a couple of months ago, we have been working with our partners to help them better understand the program. We've also provided them with some extra tools that help drive positive conversations with customers and we are incentivizing the channel partners to up sell collections, which would further enhance their cash flow. We're not making projections [technical difficulty] will move over this year or next, but believe we will have a smaller pool of maintenance customers by the time we get to the end of our fiscal year '20. Now I'll turn it over to Scott for a closer look at some of the financials. Scott Herren Thanks Andrew. Once again, all of you should have the prepared remarks document, which is the best source for our financial details. So I'm not going to walk through all of them, but if you want to hit on a couple of noteworthy items, and then talk about our business outlook for fiscal 18.  Before I get into the numbers, I want to draw your attention to our new format for revenue reporting which greatly improves transparency. You'll now see 3 revenue lines, one for subscription, one for maintenance and one for license and other revenues. In this format, you'll no longer need the reconciliation table in our prepared remarks doc as all subscription revenue which we used to call new model will be reported in the subscription line and all maintenance revenue will be recorded in maintenance line. All remaining non-recurring revenue will be reported as license and other revenue. In this new format, quarterly subscription revenue times four equals subscription ARR and quarterly maintenance revenue times four equals to maintenance ARR and you'll be better able to isolate non-recurring revenues that will flow into the license and other revenue line. Note that one side effect in this change results in additional small legacy products being added into the ARR calculation. As a result, we have slightly adjusted the historical figures for ARR, so that you have an apples-to-apples comparison for our Q1 results in going forward.  This is an improvement we've been working on and many of you've been asking for the quite a while and I think we can all agree this is clear and more transparent. Moving to spend management, we're proud that we've been able to drive strong growth in all of our important transition metrics while reducing our Q1 non-GAAP spend by 3%. We know that some of you have been skeptical of our ability to grow our business while keeping spend flat this year and next year, but we continue to achieve our goals by making sure that we're investing in critical elements of our transition while reducing spend in other areas, driving efficiencies throughout the company and the best thing smaller non-core products. During the stage of our transition, deferred revenue is a better measure of our business than reported revenue. Deferred revenue grew 18% against the really tough compare last year, when we were still selling multi-year maintenance contracts. As you know with discontinued multi-year maintenance sales in conjunction with the launch of the maintenance subscription program. You’ll notice another new discloser we added this quarter for unbilled deferred revenue, which we define simply as revenue that has been contractually committed by our customers, but not yet billed and not included on balance sheet. Specifically driven by our multi-year large enterprise business agreements or EBAs. Historically, unbilled deferred revenue was an immaterial number, but as we move forward this year. We’re planning or moving more of our enterprise customers to annual billings with the contract, which are typically three-year commitments. We are providing visibility for unbilled deferred revenue to give you a more holistic view on our quarterly results. We remained aggressive with our stock buyback plan in Q1 and repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total of $192 million and that averages out to a little over $85 per share. The downside of our stock price at this level is we’re not able to buyback quite as many shares, but we remain committed to offsetting dilution from our equity plans and reducing our share count over China. Overall, our strong Q1 results increased our confidence with the transition is working for our customers and our partners, it also sets us up for success for the rest of the year and reinforces our conviction in our fiscal ’20 targets. Turning to our outlook our view of the global economic conditions remains consistent with our view of the past several quarters, but most of the mature markets performing relatively well and little change in emerging markets. As we look at our outlook for the second quarter, we expect a seasonal decrease in subscriptions additions in Q2 consistent with what we’ve seen in the last two years. In the Q1 sub ads have added benefit from a seasonally strong EBAs solid prior quarter and the legacy promo. However, we're pleased with our execution in the current business trends and have confidence in our ability to drive results, we’re taking appropriately conservative approach and leaving the full year fiscal ’18 outlook unchanged at this point. Finally, I want to provide an update on our CEO transition. The board is currently in the process of vetting external candidates, as well as both Andrew and Amar. We don’t have any other update on the CEO selection process, other than to say it's a top priority for the board and is progressing as plan. In the meantime, we continue to execute very well through the transition and Andrew and Amar have the board’s full confident to lead the company to ongoing success. To wrap things up, we’ve executed well over the past several quarters and we are looking forward to building on this through fiscal 2018 and work toward our fiscal ’20 goals and beyond. Operator, we’d now like to open up the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Mark Grant Hi, thanks. This is Mark Grant on for Heather. Just a quick one for me. Are you mentioned that the maintenance renewals were a little bit better in the quarter than you’d seen in recent trends? Was there a possibility in the quarter that you had maintenance renewal kind of pulled forward customers coming forward and trying to renew maintenance ahead of the maintenance to subscription transition? And then quick follow-up to that is on the full year guidance of, reason for not raising the full year guidance for such a great quarter? Amarpreet Hanspal Yes. So on the maintenance question, maintenance was better than expected really. I think we had a small group of renewals and I think most of our customers who renewed were trying to line-up with the maintenance to subscription transactions. We didn't see any unnatural pull forward into the quarter. And it was better than expected and we expect to continue to do well with the renewal rates because we paying a lot of attention to it.  Andrew Anagnost Yes, and on the second part of your question the full year guide. we've executed well over the last several quarters and certainly executed well in Q1. That's giving us increased confidence as both the transition is working for our customers, but it's also working for our partners and we feel good about where we are at this point in the year, but there is long way to go. It's 90 days into a full year at this point, I think it's appropriate to be prudent with the guide for the full year. Mark Grant Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.  Philip Winslow Hey, thanks guys and congrats on a what was at those Q1. Question for Andrew and Scott, going back to the maintenance because, obviously, just overall subscriber count growth was well ahead of people's expectations and the maintenance decline was definitely less than what we were expecting. Curious [technical difficulty] obviously, there are a lot of changes going on pricing, but wondering if you can comment on just the feedback you're getting from customers and sort of the early thoughts on sort of how you expect this to play out. I know you're not getting specific guidance, but maybe kind a help us walk us through and how you're hearing and how you're thinking about that? Andrew Anagnost Yeah Phil, let me talk to it. So first off, let me remind you how structured this program so we can put some of the feedback in context. It's a multi-year program, we've rolled out 3 years' worth of changes in the customer base, so that they could actually get a lot of visibility to what they could expect over the next few years. The first year is modest price increases, the program starts June 1 and you're going to see a 5% price increase. So whether you are a maintenance customers that really wants to see in maintenance or wants to move to subscription now, you're really going to renew and move forward and take -- you're going to take an action, a positive actions. Because you got a year ahead to think about it. And what we're going to be doing in that year is we're going to be collecting the customer reaction and we're also going to be demonstrating to the customers more explicitly why there is more value in the subscription world. The value is going to show up just the nature of the offering, we just talk about access controlling insights. We're also going to be adding a lot more value related to bringing the cloud much closer to the subscription offering. So we give the customers lots of runway. We expected there was going to be different types of reaction at the program, which is one of the reasons why we built in this year for people to digest what we're doing. So as we've rolled it out we've gotten reaction from some of our larger customers whether we're just looking at it and they're going, we were going to move to subscriptions anyway or we're going to move to an EPA. So we're going to probably move forward with a lowest price possible. Our smaller customers are where we've gotten the most noise. And essentially, they're concerned about losing access to their perpetual software. That's why we got the one year cooling off period for us to absorb this feedback, for us to engage with these customers and for us to really prove to them that not only are they moving to a better higher value offering but we're going to protect them as they move forward. So that's where we're at right now, and I wouldn't expect anything else to change. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays.  Saket Kalia Actually, maybe I'll start with you Scott. So, subscription ARPS, to the point earlier saw at second quarter of sequential growth here. You've talked about this being a little bit of a volatile metric, because of the mix in the past. You see like we’re getting some point, where some of the higher price subscriptions or really having a structural impact on the ARPS number. Where we could see a little bit more stability in that metric going forward? Andrew Anagnost This is Andrew, I’m going to take that one. Saket Kalia Sure. Andrew Anagnost As we said, this metric is highly sensitive to mix, it’s highly sensitive not only in the product mix, but also the geo mix, whether it’s emerging in mature markets. And what we’ve said consistently and we’re sticking to it, is that we move into the second half of the year, we’re going to start to see that metric trend up. And we’re not changing, we’re not changing that guidance. I want to remind you thought about some of the things that are going to keep pushing that up. One, we’re going to be absorbing that maintenance to subscription price increased, the 5% that pushes into the ecosystem, so that’s going and trend that up a bit. You’re also going to see some core price increases and the moved to collections, it’s going to put upward pressure on that. We’re also going to see the decreasing discount, remember with the discount just around a fraction of what it was in previous years on our legacy programs, you’re going to see that. But you’re also going to see the mix in mature and emerging change, which is going to puts some positive pressure. As we’re more successful in the cloud, you’re going to see downward pressure. So those are the factors that are going to be affecting this, as we move it to the second half of the year, but we’re holding to the statement we made previously, you are going to see a trend up as we move to the second half. Saket Kalia Got it. That’s really helpful. And then my follow-up, maybe for you Amar. It sounds like in some of your prepared commentary, that some of the competitive wins, sounds like just a little bit stronger this quarter. Can you just talk maybe qualitatively about any competitive metrics that you look out whether that's win rates or competitive conversions? Talk to us a little bit about maybe how you feel competitively this quarter maybe versus others? Amarpreet Hanspal Saket, great question, thanks. We definitely feeling the positive about how we’re position in the industry and how they driving change. Our investment of strategy of using the cloud to drive a new paradigm and look billing industry, as well as manufacturing industry is really paying off. In manufacturing in particular with Fusion and the changes we’re driving and getting industrial additive manufacturing and causes by genetic design, customers are really paying a lot of attention and adopting those ideas from us in a big way. And in many cases at the expense of our competition, in fact many of our Fusion 360 wins this quarter, in fact in an increasing rate are coming and the expense of our competition. Leaving sort of old, 20-year old [indiscernible] CAD systems and starting to adopt the paradigm we've putting forward with Fusion, which connects CAD to CAM to CAE [ph], with data management build-in.  So in manufacturing we really feel like the customer is searching for the next paradigm and they’re starting to really turn to Fusion and adopt it in response to that. Likewise, in the building industry, the big several competitive push that in success that we’re seeing is really in construction. I would say, actually a major competitor has been paid for in some ways that they are moving from an analog to a digital ways of working, and we've been leading the way in using cloud and mobile to drive a construction management and BIM management process for those customers. So definitely we’re feeling both of those factors and manufacturing construction growing at a really fast pace, we feel very good about where we're positioned in both industries. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst Thanks guys, it's Jack [indiscernible] on for Sterling tonight. Couple of questions from us, the first being in the revenue by product family, looks like AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT actually grew year-over-year as far as the major segments are concerned. Any particular reason that that return to growth in the quarter whereas AEC and manufacturing are still down year-over-year? Andrew Anagnost Yeah, Jack. When you look at that you've got to reflect back what was happened in Q1 and year ago. It was our first quarter without selling any perpetual licenses on AutoCAD and LT. And you remember when we ended the sale at the end of the prior quarter in Q4 there were some buy ahead activities. So with AutoCAD and LT Q1 a year ago, so the compare point was a little bit artificially low with some demand pulled backward into the prior year. That's part of what contributed to it, I would say we're seeing very strong uptick though for both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, and the LT family with product subscription. So it's a combination of both.  Amarpreet Hanspal Right, and what I'd actually was Scott you said it's one of the, we're seeing subscription working everywhere around the world. One of the geographies which really did well for us sequentially is APAC. And APAC has all is been a strong contributor to the AutoCAD and LT results and that's sort of reflected in the numbers you're seeing. The other thing I would say, you made a comment about AEC and manufacturing, I would just take this opportunity to say, in manufacturing one other thing is going on is a [indiscernible] business moved from a perpetual license business to a subscription business over these quarters and that sort of reflected in those numbers. So I would say that manufacturing numbers be a downward trend of that is exaggerated because of that shift of revenue upfront from readable, but performing strongly across all industries, we feel very good about where we are. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great. thank you. And then actually since you mentioned geographies for my follow up, it appears that at least on revenue basis year-over-year Americas did a little bit better than the other major geographies. Is that also true as far as bookings are concerned, or was there just a little bit of some noise in the revenue for the regions? Andrew Anagnost Yeah Jack, we actually did well in all regions. I think it's one thing to look at it year-over-year, if you look at it sequentially, we actually did well in Americas, in Europe and in APAC and as Amar just pointed out, actually it seem to have at least on the bottom in APAC and don't have the same headwind that we had for most of the year last year there. So it does nothing that stands out that was particularly strong or particularly weak in any of the 3GOs, it was good performance across the board. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities.  Jay Vleeschhouwer  Question number one, perhaps for Andrew and Amar is, if you could talk about the role of distribution or distributors in the future. Have you see their roles in terms of fulfillments license management, et cetera? And as well could you talk about the effects of any past or perspective pricing changes if you put through distribution. In other words, you've changed the pricing for bars looking to purchase directly from the company versus perhaps more favorable pricing let's say, big buy to distribution instead. And then secondly, in the first quarter, it would appear that collections, have you seen in the direct business where a smaller percentage of the business than the former suites had been. Could you verify that and how are you thinking about the progression of collection as percentage of the business as you go through the rest of the year? Andrew Anagnost All right. So Jay, that was a multi-part question. So let me go through each one of these, one at a time. So look when it comes to bars and distribution in our future, let's be very quick. Our business is going to be bigger and the size of the pie that the bars we’re going to get the size of the business, if they're going to be able to participate will be bigger as well. We are going to be doing to be doing more business direct through major accounts and direct to the e-store, but we are absolutely going to be providing a bigger business to our indirect partners as well as we move forward. Now your question with regarding the pricing to [indiscernible] things like that. We are constantly evolving and changing our frameworks and changing the pricing and the things that go through the framework to optimize where the things are going.  I'm not going to comment on any specific pricing strategy we put out there in the system, but we’re always doing that to optimize how we distribute and deliver the software and the customers. I mean your last question is about collections. So first, I would talk about where is the overall strategy going with collections. It’s absolutely our goal to ensure that our new customers are moving to collections versus buying standalone products. And as you know we light up the main subscription program in June, there is going to be a major push to move those customers over that collections. Those activities are brewing and gestational right now. But with regards to collection results, we’re actually really happy where we’re at. The volume runway in Q1 is equivalent to suites run rate in the same period a year ago and that’s exactly where we want to be. In the short period of time, we basically gotten back up to that runway and that’s like where we should be. But as we move forward into the year, you’re going to see collections contribution go up more and more and throughout the year. But right now we’re exactly where we select to these. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss Excellent. Nice quarter guys and thank you for taking the questions. I just wondering if you could talk a little bit about better renewal rates on the main side of equations. I wondering if you could give us any sort of viewpoint on sort of the renewal rates on the new model such as the subscription subject if you will, get a little time under your belt. How are those coming in and particularly how to those look relatively to sort of what you’d see in your maintenance is? Scott Herren Yes. The renewal rates was strong across the board, I mean the product subscription rates were right in line with our expectations. It doesn’t compare maintenance to product subscriptions, I mean, one thing that keep in mind is, one of the benefits of the product subscription is customers switch things on and off and some on monthly and some on quarterly subscribers. So you don’t really get the new rates of by subscription types, but we are pleased with where product subscriptions ended up and this continues to be a big focus area for us for remainder of the year.  Keith Weiss Got it. And then my second question. I mean to continue in the line of question that Jay was going down on the reseller channel. Now they were fully on a subscription model. Can you tell us a little bit about sort of what the incentives and what is the incentive program look like for the channel and broad stocks? Is that on ARR, is it on subscription. Give us some any indication of where you took that now that it's not going to be kind of a revenue base model anymore? Andrew Anagnost Actually no. This is Andrew. So the incentives we put into the systems for partners are aligned with the kind of outcomes we want with subscriptions. For example, we're obviously going to incent them to encourage the customer to look at collection, because obviously that's something we've really want the customer to consider and we think that's the right path for them moving forward and best path for the future. So we also want them send adoption and renewal activity, so we actually putting incentives into the system do ensure that the partners are making sure that the customers are actually using the software because like Amar said, when you're on a subscription model, you can start and stop if you want, so we want the partners to guarantee that the customers are actually adopting things. we put incentives into the system like that to drive that kind of behavior. Amarpreet Hanspal Yeah I agree and keep that just add to that overtime, you see us continuing to optimize our incentive structure to drive the kind of results and the outcomes that we want. Subscriptions obviously is a big focus for us right now driving collections is a big focus for us right now. And since I've been making sure that our renewal rates are right where we want it to be in and then we're using our classic combination of front and backend discounts to get those results. And as Jay's earlier comment with the distribution channel that's another place where we've been sort of just optimizing our relationships and our incentive structure to get the right results again to drive this overall recurring revenue and subscription business that we are getting the channel oriented around. Keith Weiss To be absolutely clear, I mean, is it fair to say that in terms of whether or not a partner hit plan or not point quarter if you will. Did ARR reached base revenues or is it just there is a whole collection of things they [indiscernible]. Amarpreet Hanspal Can you say that again ARR and then we lost the second part of the question. Keith Weiss So in terms of sort of like from a headline number per partners you guys have done do business reviews. Is there a version of a quarter, like when they hit plan does ARR replace whether revenue used to be, they used to have to hit the revenue target, now they are at ARR target or is it little bit complicated in that? Amarpreet Hanspal Our engagements with partner is very simple, we talk about billings numbers with them and building outcomes with them and the annualized contract value. We don't try to do ARR compensation models with our partner channel, that would be far too complicated for them to not only engage with, but actually for them to measure and react to. So we keep that very simple because we want to their transactional ability.  Operator Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.  Gregg Moskowitz  Okay thanks very much and good afternoon guys. Wondering if you could add any commentary on the mix of LT subscriptions this quarter as compared with both AutoCAD and the AutoCAD Vertical subscriptions. Scott Herren Yeah hi Gregg. LT continues to be the volume part of the business, as it did was in the perpetual license world it is in the product subscription world. We're not seeing a significant shift in the mix of LT either going at a higher percent on a volume basis on a lower percent, LT and AutoCAD kind a continue to hold serve at the level they were. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay. Amarpreet Hanspal Go ahead sorry. Gregg Moskowitz  Sorry Amar, go ahead.  Amarpreet Hanspal I think we saw product strength across all products including the Verticals as well as the Vertical product the two new Vertical products, there wasn't a single standout product that was driving -- these all strength across the board. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay, perfect. And then just a question for Andrew, find it’s really interesting that you got essentially the same amount of legacy on subscriber conversions this quarter, at a 30% discount as you did a year ago at 70% discount and that you’re still seeing half of the conversions at an aging that in seven years or older. So the question is in the past you’ve spoken about a 30% conversion rate of licensees that were five years older or less. Is there any reason why the conversion percentage can be a lot of higher than that? Andrew Anagnost Look, we’re going to continue to convert very highly rates, let's make sure that we’re clear on exactly how are going to be converting the customers, because the promo are only one measure of our conversion success. It’s a three pronged strategy we are looking at to bring the customers in. One is the pace of functionality that we update in the existing products, so is the ecosystem become very much out of date, very quickly for the customers that stay off the current release. The other aspects of the things that we’re doing is entangling the cloud value so deeply in the subscription offering, that the customers are really compelled to get that value captured and integrated in their processes. More and more the cloud offerings are going to becomes super critical to what our customers do and that's going to get deeply entangling into the subscription offering. The last bit was these legacy promos and these offerings that we use. These are not the -- that’s not the absolute measure of legacy conversion, just the fact that we’re doing the kinds of net ads, but you see here means that we’re dipping into these non-subscriber's basis. We’re going to continue to do it and we’re going to continue to do it at reasonable rates and I think the program is working exactly as we said that it will. Amarpreet Hanspal One of the things that we have peace with is that, we didn’t have to discount aggressively to get the kind of sub results that we saw. And as Andrew mentioned, I mean, I think as some ways the net as number is becoming a better indicator, how where we are converting our overall opportunity than any individual promotion to reach the second [indiscernible] base. As Andrew said, at some level there is a network affecting being built as our new products rollout and customers want to be current and many of the sales select into the buying and use subscription to be current. So I think overall, we’re seeing the promo work, we’re seeing usually net sales is go up, because of the new product subscribing. So I think we’re doing well with that opportunity. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay. That’s great. Thank you. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Citigroup. Ken Wong Scott, I know you guys mentioned flat total spend for the year. But how should we think about the trajectory of sales and marketing, once you guys launch the maintenance to subs program. Would that tick up meaningfully? Scott Herren I don’t think so, Ken. You saw that for the first quarter, we actually posted a decline in spend of about 3% during Q1. Obviously for us to be flat for the year, it’s not going to stay minus 3% throughout the year. So I would expect to see slight increases going forward, but that still comes in flat for the year. And there is no particular swing between categories as we rollout maintenance to subscriptions. Maintenance to subs is obviously a huge focus, both of our sales team for our channel. But I don’t see that driving any particular bump and extends.  Ken Wong Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up on just receivables. So it was, I guess it was count pretty good amount from what it was last year. Can you remind us something last year drive up accounts receivable collections much more than typical? Scott Herren Yes. What drives receivables of course is linear in the quarter. What get sold during the quarter in the last month because we in most cases, we bill in that 30. So we had a very linear quarter this quarter if you look at our DSOs this quarter, they were below 45, I think 43 days, whereas last quarter it was a much more backend loaded quarter. So you just think of linearity during the quarter as nothing else that's happened that would skew that one way or the another. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Your line is now open.  Unidentified Analyst Hi, this is Shanker for Kash thanks for letting me ask question, and congrats on the good results. I have a question on the maintenance conversion. So my understand is that if the maintenance customers currently using LT or AutoCAD product, he would most slightly shift to an LT or AutoCAD products in subscription it's in the customer convert. So in that context if you can you elaborate how -- discount you're offering, how else are you incentivizing the customer to adopt collections? From a geographical mix as well how customers.  Scott Herren So the mainly, the way the program is structured is that, the customer that's moving at the time can move like-for-like they can move LT to LT or AutoCAD to AutoCAD but they're never going to get a better price to move to a collection than they will at that point. The discount on collection that they get is the same 60% discount they get moving for like-for-like. So there is a strong incentive in the system especially for an AutoCAD customer to consider a collection. Probably less so for an LT customer but definitely for an AutoCAD customer. And what we've done as we've armed our partner channels all across the world we basically tool that let them sit down with the customers and say hey, here are your options, here is what happens if you move now, here is what happened if you move next year. And by the way, if you move to a collection this is the price you lock in and this is the value you get with regards to the product offerings. So we put a lot of work into educating the channel in particular and how to have a conversation with the customer in terms of moving up to a collection.  Amarpreet Hanspal This is simply our partners know how to do, and this is a one -- it's not just incentive for the customers, our partners really take advantage of this one-time opportunity to move their customers to a higher recurring revenue base, and I think they're really focused on that opportunity right now. Unidentified Analyst Got it. Just a follow up question, you mentioned above the smaller customers having an issue with the subscription plan and you're working with them. Could you elaborate the feedback they received on potential price increases that could happen post fiscal '20? Are there any pushbacks on that or what the strategy there? Andrew Anagnost Like I said, the feedback the negative feedback we've got was exactly what we've expected. When you announce to a customer that their maintenance prices are going up over a three-year period. You expect to get some feedback that's not necessarily positive. It has primarily been from the smaller customers and when you look at their main issue, it's doesn’t come down to maintenance versus subscription. They recognize that the program we've put in place puts reasonable price increases for them and they get they love the royalty program. What they are worried about is giving up their perpetual license. So what we are just we're just next year and the by the way it is over this next year. Because they're obviously going to renew at a 5% increase is essentially show the customers that they need small accounts, that moving to a subscription is a more valuable path for them and something that helps them accomplish what they need to do more effectively. We're committed to doing that and that's really going to be the essence of our response to these customers is delivering the value they're expecting to see and helping them understand exactly what they get when they move to subscription.  Amarpreet Hanspal Well I think one thing you noticed in talking to our partners. when we first announced this program and like got a much of reaction And then as our customers started talking to our partners. I mean a lot of that concern has started to going down, because of all the thing that Andrew said, that our customers are starting to understand better, the value proposition or subscription and kind of pricing one that we're putting in. And so I think that there was a little bit of component, we maybe an upstream, but that is really starting to new and customers are much more comfortable with the path that we have put forward. Unidentified Analyst If I may just ask one more, this as a follow-up to that. Is there any difference in the geography versus U.S. versus Europe versus Asia is there any difference and how customers reacted? Andrew Anagnost No. The reactions fairly uniformed. I mean, obviously you get some smaller variations, but it’s really uniform and it’s very similar to the reaction we got when we announced the end of perpetual. So it’s playing out exactly the same way and we’re going to go to the exact in process. But there is no particular geography or country that show any propensity to be concerned. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities. Steve Koenig I’m going to turn to bunch the two questions maybe at ones, because they're kind of related. So I guess first, to what extent are your plans for the discount that you'll offer on subscriptions done at the M2S program next year and the year after. Are those pretty much hard wire or might you change those? And kind of the related question is, I understand you’re not prepared to give the guide yet on the M2S program, the volumes that you will get out of the M2S program and that sensible that you’re not ready yet to do that. But to what extent -- can you give us color on to what extent to your fiscal ’20 targets depend on the price increases that you will effectively get from the maintenance customers and the converting customers? Andrew Anagnost So I’m going to answer part of that and then I’m going to let Scott speak to the other part of it. So with regard to the maintenance subscription program, look we’ve rolled out the program. We created visibility, we’ve told them, they’re getting a 60% discount, that discount goes down by 5% every year as they -- depending on what year they move. It’s our intend to stick to that program and stick to that program, we think it’s an excellent program, it's an excellent level of discount. There is really no reason to change that. So I don’t anticipate any change in the actual rules of the program. Scott Herren Yes. I hear you that Steve. And so your second question, there is interesting effect, if you look at the price increases filled into maintenance to subscription. The longest someone stays on maintenance, of course they incur higher price increases, the more they contribute to ARR. So there is a bit of a reverse, it’s a big counter inclusive. There is no dependency on a very rapid shift over, in fact the slower it goes actually boost ARR a bit as it moves along. So there is no significant dependency model on that. Steve Koenig May I clarity than Scott. Have you assumed in your long-term guide, a rapid, fairly rapid shift over, so there is fairly minimal price boost, or there is the long-term guidance require that significant number of customers stay on maintenance. Scott Herren Yes. Our long-term targets do assume that it shifts over and that the majority do shift over, but I don’t want to get into any of the details on what that looks like, I said there is an interesting play in terms of the rate and pace, that they move in the effective house [ph] in the model. As with most of the metrics in the models, Steve, we try to be somewhat conservative on those. Andrew Anagnost We have a clear goal to get as much of that maintenance phase moved over to subscription by FY '20 as we possibly can.  Steve Koenig Sounds good. Thank you.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Ken Talanian So you had a nice down tick in expenses in this quarter, and I was wondering if you could walk us through some of your key initiatives to continue to contain expenses. What elements might cause you to perform better than your current guidance on that front? Scott Herren Sure just to be clear, we typically always see a sequential down tick in spend from Q4 to Q1. Q4, as yearend, there is a lot of the true ups that happened on variable compensation plans on commissions. It’s a quarter that we have our AU events which also drives our expense. So the normal seasonality you'd expect to decline from Q4 to Q1, the rate of that decline in some ways depends on how successful we were in the prior year because submissions are not an insignificant part of that decline. So it's not a -- while it is a sequential decline and it's not unexpected sequential decline from Q4 to Q1. Amar if you want to touch on how we're managing spend? Amarpreet Hanspal So Ken, what I'd add is that outlook for the year on spend is being unchanged because we've instituted operational rigor and discipline and continue to make very hard choices in investing in the right areas to drive the transition and divest in sort of non-core projects and non-core activities and just keep a tight focus on managing spends. So our outlook for the year is unchanged and I think we're making all the right decisions in terms of ensuring that the transition remains on track. And some of the things like we decided to divest, we had a bunch of consumer products for example last year, that are not material to the transition we make choices like volume [ph] divest, and that's giving us some of the fuel we need to keep driving the transition forward. Ken Talanian Okay, great. And there is a follow up, I realized it's early, but could you give us a sense to how to think about what the price increase is might look like in the years following the initial three-year subscription discount that folks will be locking in? Will it mean -- directionally could you expect it be on par with the subscription price, absent that discount or might it even be more? Scott Herren Ken, we've been very explicit at the program where the customer pops up to the terminal discount price of the program. So the main subscription program lasts three years, and at the end of that third year, there is a particular discount. That's the price that everybody trues up to when they exit the program. Which by the way is the right thing to do with regard to incenting the customer to not only give up their perpetual license, but feel comfortable with the move to subscription. Ken Talanian Okay. And is that for EBAs as well or just product in collections? Scott Herren EBAs are a totally different process. So when customer moves to EBA, they've moved off of maintenance to a consumption model. Remember, when you go for all of these things, with regards to the way we've rolled out the prices, the way we manage the price increases at the terminal point. Our goal is to maximize the value of that maintenance base and that is all about minimizing the churn out of those customers during that base. We feel like we've created a program that balances both the price uplift and the churn factors that guide us and maximizing the value of that base, that's what's driving all of this.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest. Monika Garg  I guess first question, one which we get quite often is that. Looking at it, it seems like a low gross market, but your target of 20% subscription growth means, you need to add somewhere between 850,000 to 900,000 new subscriptions ever year. So can you maybe walk through the math to achieve that? Andrew Anagnost Yes. There is a fundamental thing we've been telling the people over and over again with regards to how this [technical difficulty]. First off, the move to subscription is reset the price points for design software pretty dramatically. So what we’re seeing is, we’re seeing increased demand for our offering, just by virtue of the fact that upfront costs are some much lower. Then there is a couple of other factors that play out here in terms of hitting those long-term subscription targets. One is the non-subscriber base we’ve been talking about over and over again throughout the last few years, those customers are moving forward. The other, which is a 2 million plus based of people. The other base is the 12 million pirate based that is going that move from pirated software to subscriptions, we know, we understand that base, we know they're moving forward. But the more important factor as we look over a five-year period. Is the market expansion, we’re going to see with the delivery of the cloud applications in both construction and manufacturing. The move to the cloud, especially in the manufacturing space starting to share shift away from our competitors to our offerings. When you add all of those things together, the 20% of subscription growth target is quite achievable and is achievable not only from growing off our existing core, but expanding into these new markets in construction and manufacturing.  Amarpreet Hanspal Monika, I just [indiscernible], we’ve always been the volume leader in the industries that serve and we continue to do that, we continue to drive as Andrew said share shift now increasingly manufacturing from traditional CADscan [ph] systems over to new cloud based disruptive system like Fusion and with the adoption of construction solutions they all expand our opportunity. And so in combination with the [indiscernible] compliance, with legacy opportunity and just the organic volume we see through job growth in the industries, I think we feel, we remain confident in our goals that we set ourselves. Monika Garg  Perfect. Thanks. And then as a follow-up. Could you share the split of subscription between EBAs, cloud and product subs? Thank you. Andrew Anagnost The one, so I could say we don’t give it at that level of granularity, the one number we have shared is the number of EBA subscription in this quarter was 44,000. And that’s really -- we sold above EBAs [ph] in Q4, you watched how they get used and adopted, or how many uses in those accounts adopt are EBA solutions and then sort of 90 days later we count the subscription. So that number was 44,000. At this point we’re not prepared to breakout cloud and product subs. But look as we’ve said, our strategy is working, our business monetization, platform transition is working, subscription is working everywhere. So we saw strength across all of those subscription types. Monika Garg  Thank you so much. Operator  Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn things back over David Gennarelli for any closing comments. David Gennarelli Thanks, operator. We’ll be at the JP Morgan conference in Boston next Tuesday and the Canaccord one-on-one conference in Toronto next Thursday. We’ll be at the Berenberg and the NASDAQ conferences in London on June 14th and 15th respectively. And last we will be hosting investor and analyst at AU London on June 21, so please let me if you'd like to be attending that event as well. So for anything else you can reach me at 415-507-6033. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation for attending today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Our first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Mark Grant Hi, thanks. This is Mark Grant on for Heather. Just a quick one for me. Are you mentioned that the maintenance renewals were a little bit better in the quarter than you’d seen in recent trends? Was there a possibility in the quarter that you had maintenance renewal kind of pulled forward customers coming forward and trying to renew maintenance ahead of the maintenance to subscription transition? And then quick follow-up to that is on the full year guidance of, reason for not raising the full year guidance for such a great quarter? Amarpreet Hanspal Yes. So on the maintenance question, maintenance was better than expected really. I think we had a small group of renewals and I think most of our customers who renewed were trying to line-up with the maintenance to subscription transactions. We didn't see any unnatural pull forward into the quarter. And it was better than expected and we expect to continue to do well with the renewal rates because we paying a lot of attention to it.  Andrew Anagnost Yes, and on the second part of your question the full year guide. we've executed well over the last several quarters and certainly executed well in Q1. That's giving us increased confidence as both the transition is working for our customers, but it's also working for our partners and we feel good about where we are at this point in the year, but there is long way to go. It's 90 days into a full year at this point, I think it's appropriate to be prudent with the guide for the full year. Mark Grant Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.  Philip Winslow Hey, thanks guys and congrats on a what was at those Q1. Question for Andrew and Scott, going back to the maintenance because, obviously, just overall subscriber count growth was well ahead of people's expectations and the maintenance decline was definitely less than what we were expecting. Curious [technical difficulty] obviously, there are a lot of changes going on pricing, but wondering if you can comment on just the feedback you're getting from customers and sort of the early thoughts on sort of how you expect this to play out. I know you're not getting specific guidance, but maybe kind a help us walk us through and how you're hearing and how you're thinking about that? Andrew Anagnost Yeah Phil, let me talk to it. So first off, let me remind you how structured this program so we can put some of the feedback in context. It's a multi-year program, we've rolled out 3 years' worth of changes in the customer base, so that they could actually get a lot of visibility to what they could expect over the next few years. The first year is modest price increases, the program starts June 1 and you're going to see a 5% price increase. So whether you are a maintenance customers that really wants to see in maintenance or wants to move to subscription now, you're really going to renew and move forward and take -- you're going to take an action, a positive actions. Because you got a year ahead to think about it. And what we're going to be doing in that year is we're going to be collecting the customer reaction and we're also going to be demonstrating to the customers more explicitly why there is more value in the subscription world. The value is going to show up just the nature of the offering, we just talk about access controlling insights. We're also going to be adding a lot more value related to bringing the cloud much closer to the subscription offering. So we give the customers lots of runway. We expected there was going to be different types of reaction at the program, which is one of the reasons why we built in this year for people to digest what we're doing. So as we've rolled it out we've gotten reaction from some of our larger customers whether we're just looking at it and they're going, we were going to move to subscriptions anyway or we're going to move to an EPA. So we're going to probably move forward with a lowest price possible. Our smaller customers are where we've gotten the most noise. And essentially, they're concerned about losing access to their perpetual software. That's why we got the one year cooling off period for us to absorb this feedback, for us to engage with these customers and for us to really prove to them that not only are they moving to a better higher value offering but we're going to protect them as they move forward. So that's where we're at right now, and I wouldn't expect anything else to change. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays.  Saket Kalia Actually, maybe I'll start with you Scott. So, subscription ARPS, to the point earlier saw at second quarter of sequential growth here. You've talked about this being a little bit of a volatile metric, because of the mix in the past. You see like we’re getting some point, where some of the higher price subscriptions or really having a structural impact on the ARPS number. Where we could see a little bit more stability in that metric going forward? Andrew Anagnost This is Andrew, I’m going to take that one. Saket Kalia Sure. Andrew Anagnost As we said, this metric is highly sensitive to mix, it’s highly sensitive not only in the product mix, but also the geo mix, whether it’s emerging in mature markets. And what we’ve said consistently and we’re sticking to it, is that we move into the second half of the year, we’re going to start to see that metric trend up. And we’re not changing, we’re not changing that guidance. I want to remind you thought about some of the things that are going to keep pushing that up. One, we’re going to be absorbing that maintenance to subscription price increased, the 5% that pushes into the ecosystem, so that’s going and trend that up a bit. You’re also going to see some core price increases and the moved to collections, it’s going to put upward pressure on that. We’re also going to see the decreasing discount, remember with the discount just around a fraction of what it was in previous years on our legacy programs, you’re going to see that. But you’re also going to see the mix in mature and emerging change, which is going to puts some positive pressure. As we’re more successful in the cloud, you’re going to see downward pressure. So those are the factors that are going to be affecting this, as we move it to the second half of the year, but we’re holding to the statement we made previously, you are going to see a trend up as we move to the second half. Saket Kalia Got it. That’s really helpful. And then my follow-up, maybe for you Amar. It sounds like in some of your prepared commentary, that some of the competitive wins, sounds like just a little bit stronger this quarter. Can you just talk maybe qualitatively about any competitive metrics that you look out whether that's win rates or competitive conversions? Talk to us a little bit about maybe how you feel competitively this quarter maybe versus others? Amarpreet Hanspal Saket, great question, thanks. We definitely feeling the positive about how we’re position in the industry and how they driving change. Our investment of strategy of using the cloud to drive a new paradigm and look billing industry, as well as manufacturing industry is really paying off. In manufacturing in particular with Fusion and the changes we’re driving and getting industrial additive manufacturing and causes by genetic design, customers are really paying a lot of attention and adopting those ideas from us in a big way. And in many cases at the expense of our competition, in fact many of our Fusion 360 wins this quarter, in fact in an increasing rate are coming and the expense of our competition. Leaving sort of old, 20-year old [indiscernible] CAD systems and starting to adopt the paradigm we've putting forward with Fusion, which connects CAD to CAM to CAE [ph], with data management build-in.  So in manufacturing we really feel like the customer is searching for the next paradigm and they’re starting to really turn to Fusion and adopt it in response to that. Likewise, in the building industry, the big several competitive push that in success that we’re seeing is really in construction. I would say, actually a major competitor has been paid for in some ways that they are moving from an analog to a digital ways of working, and we've been leading the way in using cloud and mobile to drive a construction management and BIM management process for those customers. So definitely we’re feeling both of those factors and manufacturing construction growing at a really fast pace, we feel very good about where we're positioned in both industries. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst Thanks guys, it's Jack [indiscernible] on for Sterling tonight. Couple of questions from us, the first being in the revenue by product family, looks like AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT actually grew year-over-year as far as the major segments are concerned. Any particular reason that that return to growth in the quarter whereas AEC and manufacturing are still down year-over-year? Andrew Anagnost Yeah, Jack. When you look at that you've got to reflect back what was happened in Q1 and year ago. It was our first quarter without selling any perpetual licenses on AutoCAD and LT. And you remember when we ended the sale at the end of the prior quarter in Q4 there were some buy ahead activities. So with AutoCAD and LT Q1 a year ago, so the compare point was a little bit artificially low with some demand pulled backward into the prior year. That's part of what contributed to it, I would say we're seeing very strong uptick though for both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, and the LT family with product subscription. So it's a combination of both.  Amarpreet Hanspal Right, and what I'd actually was Scott you said it's one of the, we're seeing subscription working everywhere around the world. One of the geographies which really did well for us sequentially is APAC. And APAC has all is been a strong contributor to the AutoCAD and LT results and that's sort of reflected in the numbers you're seeing. The other thing I would say, you made a comment about AEC and manufacturing, I would just take this opportunity to say, in manufacturing one other thing is going on is a [indiscernible] business moved from a perpetual license business to a subscription business over these quarters and that sort of reflected in those numbers. So I would say that manufacturing numbers be a downward trend of that is exaggerated because of that shift of revenue upfront from readable, but performing strongly across all industries, we feel very good about where we are. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great. thank you. And then actually since you mentioned geographies for my follow up, it appears that at least on revenue basis year-over-year Americas did a little bit better than the other major geographies. Is that also true as far as bookings are concerned, or was there just a little bit of some noise in the revenue for the regions? Andrew Anagnost Yeah Jack, we actually did well in all regions. I think it's one thing to look at it year-over-year, if you look at it sequentially, we actually did well in Americas, in Europe and in APAC and as Amar just pointed out, actually it seem to have at least on the bottom in APAC and don't have the same headwind that we had for most of the year last year there. So it does nothing that stands out that was particularly strong or particularly weak in any of the 3GOs, it was good performance across the board. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities.  Jay Vleeschhouwer  Question number one, perhaps for Andrew and Amar is, if you could talk about the role of distribution or distributors in the future. Have you see their roles in terms of fulfillments license management, et cetera? And as well could you talk about the effects of any past or perspective pricing changes if you put through distribution. In other words, you've changed the pricing for bars looking to purchase directly from the company versus perhaps more favorable pricing let's say, big buy to distribution instead. And then secondly, in the first quarter, it would appear that collections, have you seen in the direct business where a smaller percentage of the business than the former suites had been. Could you verify that and how are you thinking about the progression of collection as percentage of the business as you go through the rest of the year? Andrew Anagnost All right. So Jay, that was a multi-part question. So let me go through each one of these, one at a time. So look when it comes to bars and distribution in our future, let's be very quick. Our business is going to be bigger and the size of the pie that the bars we’re going to get the size of the business, if they're going to be able to participate will be bigger as well. We are going to be doing to be doing more business direct through major accounts and direct to the e-store, but we are absolutely going to be providing a bigger business to our indirect partners as well as we move forward. Now your question with regarding the pricing to [indiscernible] things like that. We are constantly evolving and changing our frameworks and changing the pricing and the things that go through the framework to optimize where the things are going.  I'm not going to comment on any specific pricing strategy we put out there in the system, but we’re always doing that to optimize how we distribute and deliver the software and the customers. I mean your last question is about collections. So first, I would talk about where is the overall strategy going with collections. It’s absolutely our goal to ensure that our new customers are moving to collections versus buying standalone products. And as you know we light up the main subscription program in June, there is going to be a major push to move those customers over that collections. Those activities are brewing and gestational right now. But with regards to collection results, we’re actually really happy where we’re at. The volume runway in Q1 is equivalent to suites run rate in the same period a year ago and that’s exactly where we want to be. In the short period of time, we basically gotten back up to that runway and that’s like where we should be. But as we move forward into the year, you’re going to see collections contribution go up more and more and throughout the year. But right now we’re exactly where we select to these. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss Excellent. Nice quarter guys and thank you for taking the questions. I just wondering if you could talk a little bit about better renewal rates on the main side of equations. I wondering if you could give us any sort of viewpoint on sort of the renewal rates on the new model such as the subscription subject if you will, get a little time under your belt. How are those coming in and particularly how to those look relatively to sort of what you’d see in your maintenance is? Scott Herren Yes. The renewal rates was strong across the board, I mean the product subscription rates were right in line with our expectations. It doesn’t compare maintenance to product subscriptions, I mean, one thing that keep in mind is, one of the benefits of the product subscription is customers switch things on and off and some on monthly and some on quarterly subscribers. So you don’t really get the new rates of by subscription types, but we are pleased with where product subscriptions ended up and this continues to be a big focus area for us for remainder of the year.  Keith Weiss Got it. And then my second question. I mean to continue in the line of question that Jay was going down on the reseller channel. Now they were fully on a subscription model. Can you tell us a little bit about sort of what the incentives and what is the incentive program look like for the channel and broad stocks? Is that on ARR, is it on subscription. Give us some any indication of where you took that now that it's not going to be kind of a revenue base model anymore? Andrew Anagnost Actually no. This is Andrew. So the incentives we put into the systems for partners are aligned with the kind of outcomes we want with subscriptions. For example, we're obviously going to incent them to encourage the customer to look at collection, because obviously that's something we've really want the customer to consider and we think that's the right path for them moving forward and best path for the future. So we also want them send adoption and renewal activity, so we actually putting incentives into the system do ensure that the partners are making sure that the customers are actually using the software because like Amar said, when you're on a subscription model, you can start and stop if you want, so we want the partners to guarantee that the customers are actually adopting things. we put incentives into the system like that to drive that kind of behavior. Amarpreet Hanspal Yeah I agree and keep that just add to that overtime, you see us continuing to optimize our incentive structure to drive the kind of results and the outcomes that we want. Subscriptions obviously is a big focus for us right now driving collections is a big focus for us right now. And since I've been making sure that our renewal rates are right where we want it to be in and then we're using our classic combination of front and backend discounts to get those results. And as Jay's earlier comment with the distribution channel that's another place where we've been sort of just optimizing our relationships and our incentive structure to get the right results again to drive this overall recurring revenue and subscription business that we are getting the channel oriented around. Keith Weiss To be absolutely clear, I mean, is it fair to say that in terms of whether or not a partner hit plan or not point quarter if you will. Did ARR reached base revenues or is it just there is a whole collection of things they [indiscernible]. Amarpreet Hanspal Can you say that again ARR and then we lost the second part of the question. Keith Weiss So in terms of sort of like from a headline number per partners you guys have done do business reviews. Is there a version of a quarter, like when they hit plan does ARR replace whether revenue used to be, they used to have to hit the revenue target, now they are at ARR target or is it little bit complicated in that? Amarpreet Hanspal Our engagements with partner is very simple, we talk about billings numbers with them and building outcomes with them and the annualized contract value. We don't try to do ARR compensation models with our partner channel, that would be far too complicated for them to not only engage with, but actually for them to measure and react to. So we keep that very simple because we want to their transactional ability.  Operator Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.  Gregg Moskowitz  Okay thanks very much and good afternoon guys. Wondering if you could add any commentary on the mix of LT subscriptions this quarter as compared with both AutoCAD and the AutoCAD Vertical subscriptions. Scott Herren Yeah hi Gregg. LT continues to be the volume part of the business, as it did was in the perpetual license world it is in the product subscription world. We're not seeing a significant shift in the mix of LT either going at a higher percent on a volume basis on a lower percent, LT and AutoCAD kind a continue to hold serve at the level they were. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay. Amarpreet Hanspal Go ahead sorry. Gregg Moskowitz  Sorry Amar, go ahead.  Amarpreet Hanspal I think we saw product strength across all products including the Verticals as well as the Vertical product the two new Vertical products, there wasn't a single standout product that was driving -- these all strength across the board. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay, perfect. And then just a question for Andrew, find it’s really interesting that you got essentially the same amount of legacy on subscriber conversions this quarter, at a 30% discount as you did a year ago at 70% discount and that you’re still seeing half of the conversions at an aging that in seven years or older. So the question is in the past you’ve spoken about a 30% conversion rate of licensees that were five years older or less. Is there any reason why the conversion percentage can be a lot of higher than that? Andrew Anagnost Look, we’re going to continue to convert very highly rates, let's make sure that we’re clear on exactly how are going to be converting the customers, because the promo are only one measure of our conversion success. It’s a three pronged strategy we are looking at to bring the customers in. One is the pace of functionality that we update in the existing products, so is the ecosystem become very much out of date, very quickly for the customers that stay off the current release. The other aspects of the things that we’re doing is entangling the cloud value so deeply in the subscription offering, that the customers are really compelled to get that value captured and integrated in their processes. More and more the cloud offerings are going to becomes super critical to what our customers do and that's going to get deeply entangling into the subscription offering. The last bit was these legacy promos and these offerings that we use. These are not the -- that’s not the absolute measure of legacy conversion, just the fact that we’re doing the kinds of net ads, but you see here means that we’re dipping into these non-subscriber's basis. We’re going to continue to do it and we’re going to continue to do it at reasonable rates and I think the program is working exactly as we said that it will. Amarpreet Hanspal One of the things that we have peace with is that, we didn’t have to discount aggressively to get the kind of sub results that we saw. And as Andrew mentioned, I mean, I think as some ways the net as number is becoming a better indicator, how where we are converting our overall opportunity than any individual promotion to reach the second [indiscernible] base. As Andrew said, at some level there is a network affecting being built as our new products rollout and customers want to be current and many of the sales select into the buying and use subscription to be current. So I think overall, we’re seeing the promo work, we’re seeing usually net sales is go up, because of the new product subscribing. So I think we’re doing well with that opportunity. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay. That’s great. Thank you. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Citigroup. Ken Wong Scott, I know you guys mentioned flat total spend for the year. But how should we think about the trajectory of sales and marketing, once you guys launch the maintenance to subs program. Would that tick up meaningfully? Scott Herren I don’t think so, Ken. You saw that for the first quarter, we actually posted a decline in spend of about 3% during Q1. Obviously for us to be flat for the year, it’s not going to stay minus 3% throughout the year. So I would expect to see slight increases going forward, but that still comes in flat for the year. And there is no particular swing between categories as we rollout maintenance to subscriptions. Maintenance to subs is obviously a huge focus, both of our sales team for our channel. But I don’t see that driving any particular bump and extends.  Ken Wong Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up on just receivables. So it was, I guess it was count pretty good amount from what it was last year. Can you remind us something last year drive up accounts receivable collections much more than typical? Scott Herren Yes. What drives receivables of course is linear in the quarter. What get sold during the quarter in the last month because we in most cases, we bill in that 30. So we had a very linear quarter this quarter if you look at our DSOs this quarter, they were below 45, I think 43 days, whereas last quarter it was a much more backend loaded quarter. So you just think of linearity during the quarter as nothing else that's happened that would skew that one way or the another. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Your line is now open.  Unidentified Analyst Hi, this is Shanker for Kash thanks for letting me ask question, and congrats on the good results. I have a question on the maintenance conversion. So my understand is that if the maintenance customers currently using LT or AutoCAD product, he would most slightly shift to an LT or AutoCAD products in subscription it's in the customer convert. So in that context if you can you elaborate how -- discount you're offering, how else are you incentivizing the customer to adopt collections? From a geographical mix as well how customers.  Scott Herren So the mainly, the way the program is structured is that, the customer that's moving at the time can move like-for-like they can move LT to LT or AutoCAD to AutoCAD but they're never going to get a better price to move to a collection than they will at that point. The discount on collection that they get is the same 60% discount they get moving for like-for-like. So there is a strong incentive in the system especially for an AutoCAD customer to consider a collection. Probably less so for an LT customer but definitely for an AutoCAD customer. And what we've done as we've armed our partner channels all across the world we basically tool that let them sit down with the customers and say hey, here are your options, here is what happens if you move now, here is what happened if you move next year. And by the way, if you move to a collection this is the price you lock in and this is the value you get with regards to the product offerings. So we put a lot of work into educating the channel in particular and how to have a conversation with the customer in terms of moving up to a collection.  Amarpreet Hanspal This is simply our partners know how to do, and this is a one -- it's not just incentive for the customers, our partners really take advantage of this one-time opportunity to move their customers to a higher recurring revenue base, and I think they're really focused on that opportunity right now. Unidentified Analyst Got it. Just a follow up question, you mentioned above the smaller customers having an issue with the subscription plan and you're working with them. Could you elaborate the feedback they received on potential price increases that could happen post fiscal '20? Are there any pushbacks on that or what the strategy there? Andrew Anagnost Like I said, the feedback the negative feedback we've got was exactly what we've expected. When you announce to a customer that their maintenance prices are going up over a three-year period. You expect to get some feedback that's not necessarily positive. It has primarily been from the smaller customers and when you look at their main issue, it's doesn’t come down to maintenance versus subscription. They recognize that the program we've put in place puts reasonable price increases for them and they get they love the royalty program. What they are worried about is giving up their perpetual license. So what we are just we're just next year and the by the way it is over this next year. Because they're obviously going to renew at a 5% increase is essentially show the customers that they need small accounts, that moving to a subscription is a more valuable path for them and something that helps them accomplish what they need to do more effectively. We're committed to doing that and that's really going to be the essence of our response to these customers is delivering the value they're expecting to see and helping them understand exactly what they get when they move to subscription.  Amarpreet Hanspal Well I think one thing you noticed in talking to our partners. when we first announced this program and like got a much of reaction And then as our customers started talking to our partners. I mean a lot of that concern has started to going down, because of all the thing that Andrew said, that our customers are starting to understand better, the value proposition or subscription and kind of pricing one that we're putting in. And so I think that there was a little bit of component, we maybe an upstream, but that is really starting to new and customers are much more comfortable with the path that we have put forward. Unidentified Analyst If I may just ask one more, this as a follow-up to that. Is there any difference in the geography versus U.S. versus Europe versus Asia is there any difference and how customers reacted? Andrew Anagnost No. The reactions fairly uniformed. I mean, obviously you get some smaller variations, but it’s really uniform and it’s very similar to the reaction we got when we announced the end of perpetual. So it’s playing out exactly the same way and we’re going to go to the exact in process. But there is no particular geography or country that show any propensity to be concerned. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities. Steve Koenig I’m going to turn to bunch the two questions maybe at ones, because they're kind of related. So I guess first, to what extent are your plans for the discount that you'll offer on subscriptions done at the M2S program next year and the year after. Are those pretty much hard wire or might you change those? And kind of the related question is, I understand you’re not prepared to give the guide yet on the M2S program, the volumes that you will get out of the M2S program and that sensible that you’re not ready yet to do that. But to what extent -- can you give us color on to what extent to your fiscal ’20 targets depend on the price increases that you will effectively get from the maintenance customers and the converting customers? Andrew Anagnost So I’m going to answer part of that and then I’m going to let Scott speak to the other part of it. So with regard to the maintenance subscription program, look we’ve rolled out the program. We created visibility, we’ve told them, they’re getting a 60% discount, that discount goes down by 5% every year as they -- depending on what year they move. It’s our intend to stick to that program and stick to that program, we think it’s an excellent program, it's an excellent level of discount. There is really no reason to change that. So I don’t anticipate any change in the actual rules of the program. Scott Herren Yes. I hear you that Steve. And so your second question, there is interesting effect, if you look at the price increases filled into maintenance to subscription. The longest someone stays on maintenance, of course they incur higher price increases, the more they contribute to ARR. So there is a bit of a reverse, it’s a big counter inclusive. There is no dependency on a very rapid shift over, in fact the slower it goes actually boost ARR a bit as it moves along. So there is no significant dependency model on that. Steve Koenig May I clarity than Scott. Have you assumed in your long-term guide, a rapid, fairly rapid shift over, so there is fairly minimal price boost, or there is the long-term guidance require that significant number of customers stay on maintenance. Scott Herren Yes. Our long-term targets do assume that it shifts over and that the majority do shift over, but I don’t want to get into any of the details on what that looks like, I said there is an interesting play in terms of the rate and pace, that they move in the effective house [ph] in the model. As with most of the metrics in the models, Steve, we try to be somewhat conservative on those. Andrew Anagnost We have a clear goal to get as much of that maintenance phase moved over to subscription by FY '20 as we possibly can.  Steve Koenig Sounds good. Thank you.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Ken Talanian So you had a nice down tick in expenses in this quarter, and I was wondering if you could walk us through some of your key initiatives to continue to contain expenses. What elements might cause you to perform better than your current guidance on that front? Scott Herren Sure just to be clear, we typically always see a sequential down tick in spend from Q4 to Q1. Q4, as yearend, there is a lot of the true ups that happened on variable compensation plans on commissions. It’s a quarter that we have our AU events which also drives our expense. So the normal seasonality you'd expect to decline from Q4 to Q1, the rate of that decline in some ways depends on how successful we were in the prior year because submissions are not an insignificant part of that decline. So it's not a -- while it is a sequential decline and it's not unexpected sequential decline from Q4 to Q1. Amar if you want to touch on how we're managing spend? Amarpreet Hanspal So Ken, what I'd add is that outlook for the year on spend is being unchanged because we've instituted operational rigor and discipline and continue to make very hard choices in investing in the right areas to drive the transition and divest in sort of non-core projects and non-core activities and just keep a tight focus on managing spends. So our outlook for the year is unchanged and I think we're making all the right decisions in terms of ensuring that the transition remains on track. And some of the things like we decided to divest, we had a bunch of consumer products for example last year, that are not material to the transition we make choices like volume [ph] divest, and that's giving us some of the fuel we need to keep driving the transition forward. Ken Talanian Okay, great. And there is a follow up, I realized it's early, but could you give us a sense to how to think about what the price increase is might look like in the years following the initial three-year subscription discount that folks will be locking in? Will it mean -- directionally could you expect it be on par with the subscription price, absent that discount or might it even be more? Scott Herren Ken, we've been very explicit at the program where the customer pops up to the terminal discount price of the program. So the main subscription program lasts three years, and at the end of that third year, there is a particular discount. That's the price that everybody trues up to when they exit the program. Which by the way is the right thing to do with regard to incenting the customer to not only give up their perpetual license, but feel comfortable with the move to subscription. Ken Talanian Okay. And is that for EBAs as well or just product in collections? Scott Herren EBAs are a totally different process. So when customer moves to EBA, they've moved off of maintenance to a consumption model. Remember, when you go for all of these things, with regards to the way we've rolled out the prices, the way we manage the price increases at the terminal point. Our goal is to maximize the value of that maintenance base and that is all about minimizing the churn out of those customers during that base. We feel like we've created a program that balances both the price uplift and the churn factors that guide us and maximizing the value of that base, that's what's driving all of this.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest. Monika Garg  I guess first question, one which we get quite often is that. Looking at it, it seems like a low gross market, but your target of 20% subscription growth means, you need to add somewhere between 850,000 to 900,000 new subscriptions ever year. So can you maybe walk through the math to achieve that? Andrew Anagnost Yes. There is a fundamental thing we've been telling the people over and over again with regards to how this [technical difficulty]. First off, the move to subscription is reset the price points for design software pretty dramatically. So what we’re seeing is, we’re seeing increased demand for our offering, just by virtue of the fact that upfront costs are some much lower. Then there is a couple of other factors that play out here in terms of hitting those long-term subscription targets. One is the non-subscriber base we’ve been talking about over and over again throughout the last few years, those customers are moving forward. The other, which is a 2 million plus based of people. The other base is the 12 million pirate based that is going that move from pirated software to subscriptions, we know, we understand that base, we know they're moving forward. But the more important factor as we look over a five-year period. Is the market expansion, we’re going to see with the delivery of the cloud applications in both construction and manufacturing. The move to the cloud, especially in the manufacturing space starting to share shift away from our competitors to our offerings. When you add all of those things together, the 20% of subscription growth target is quite achievable and is achievable not only from growing off our existing core, but expanding into these new markets in construction and manufacturing.  Amarpreet Hanspal Monika, I just [indiscernible], we’ve always been the volume leader in the industries that serve and we continue to do that, we continue to drive as Andrew said share shift now increasingly manufacturing from traditional CADscan [ph] systems over to new cloud based disruptive system like Fusion and with the adoption of construction solutions they all expand our opportunity. And so in combination with the [indiscernible] compliance, with legacy opportunity and just the organic volume we see through job growth in the industries, I think we feel, we remain confident in our goals that we set ourselves. Monika Garg  Perfect. Thanks. And then as a follow-up. Could you share the split of subscription between EBAs, cloud and product subs? Thank you. Andrew Anagnost The one, so I could say we don’t give it at that level of granularity, the one number we have shared is the number of EBA subscription in this quarter was 44,000. And that’s really -- we sold above EBAs [ph] in Q4, you watched how they get used and adopted, or how many uses in those accounts adopt are EBA solutions and then sort of 90 days later we count the subscription. So that number was 44,000. At this point we’re not prepared to breakout cloud and product subs. But look as we’ve said, our strategy is working, our business monetization, platform transition is working, subscription is working everywhere. So we saw strength across all of those subscription types. Monika Garg  Thank you so much. Operator  Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn things back over David Gennarelli for any closing comments. David Gennarelli Thanks, operator. We’ll be at the JP Morgan conference in Boston next Tuesday and the Canaccord one-on-one conference in Toronto next Thursday. We’ll be at the Berenberg and the NASDAQ conferences in London on June 14th and 15th respectively. And last we will be hosting investor and analyst at AU London on June 21, so please let me if you'd like to be attending that event as well. So for anything else you can reach me at 415-507-6033.

Okay, good morning and thanks for joining us today. During the first quarter we continue to execute on our priorities to position our brand and organizations for long-term success. In the midst of some of the most challenging times in retail, we are adapting our business model and leveraging our strength. First quarter results reflected number of wins as well as a few challenges. Margins came under pressure as we increased promotions as per demand during slow traffic period. This compared to a very positive and largely full price first quarter last year. This year we posted 2% comp increase in the quarter and expenses were well managed. I'm never happy to report earnings below last year and we are working hard to strengthen results. Now I'll provide you a few insights into the quarter. We did a good job building our competitive strength in jeans, bottoms and women's apparel which posted positive comps. Yet we continued to have opportunity to improve the men's. Momentum of the Aerie brand was strong again this quarter, further demonstrating significant growth potential and strength of your. We posted record volumes in e-commerce, which accelerated from the prior periods. Strong double-digit growth led to an online contribution of 26% to our total revenue up from 19% last year. Effective digital marketing and increases in mobile contributed to the growth, investments and an a more seamless and positive online shopping experience across digital channels also drove sales. Now, as I look forward, we are intentionally focused on our strategic priorities to continue to fuel product innovation, strengthen our brands and delivered outstanding customers experience. Across the organizations, we are seeking efficiencies while ensuring that we are managing the business for a long-term. This quarter we repurchase 6 million shares reflecting the strength of our balance sheet. Strong cash flow, attractive valuation and confidence in our brand and long-term strategies. In this challenging retail landscape, we see tremendous opportunity to capitalize our strength including our financials, our brand and competitive advantages. We have outstanding team across the Company and they have a embraced the opportunities with the enormous energy and passion and for that I'm extremely grateful. Lastly, let me underscore that during this time of upheaval across our industry, we see great potential for our Company and our leading brands. Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to Chad. Chad Kessler Thanks, Jay. Good morning, everyone. In the first quarter the American Eagle brand had some great wins and we also faced headwinds. Our brand is stronger than ever and well positioned, but there is lots of turbulence out there. A choppy start to the quarter combined with a late Easter resulted in increased promotions. On a positive note, business improved and we had a positive comp over Easter compared to the holiday last year. For the quarter, the American Eagle brand comps declined 1% with strengthen online partially offsetting weakness in-stores. This saw at a 4% comp increase a year ago. We saw positive comps continue in men's and women's bottom with AE jeans achieving record first quarter sales. The teams continue to execute extremely well across our bottoms category. We have real competitive advantages and offer our customer something truly special. Looking ahead to the back-to-school and fall seasons, we would take our AE jeans collection and marketing to the next level. Highlighting our strengths and style, fit, innovation and wash. Jeans invited the ultimate expression of individuality and personal style. With the strengths of our product and leadership position, we have a real opportunity to continue to gain share. Women's posted strong results again in this quarter with the apparel comps in the positive mid-single-digit, with our growing momentum in the women's top categories, this has been driven by an emphasis on outfitting with a well balanced tops collection that ties back perfectly to the AE jeans assortment. I'm extremely pleased with how the team continues to deliver trend right top supported by an agile process and greater speeds in market. With each season we continue to gain new fans of our women's assortment, but we are focused on leveraging additional opportunity. As we anticipated, men's tops were challenging in the first quarter dragging total men's comps to negative mid-single-digit. As I said on the last call, we are working on the men's business, which remains the top priority for the team. As the first quarter progressed, we saw some signs of improvement in men's tops, which we hope continue as we approach to the back half of the year. AE's online sales accelerated where we saw exceptional results across the number of categories. Our exclusive online product is also been well received driving incremental growth. Continuous improvement to the shopping experience, our advanced on the tool and digital marketing have driven growth in our online business, which now represents 22% of our sales. We remain highly focused on delivering improvements across the brand including innovation, product leadership and an enhanced customer experience. The American Eagle brand is operating from a position of strength, our goal is to make sure we are putting the customer at the center of everything we do and giving them reasons to shop our brand. That's how we will continue to win. Thanks to my team for the many successes we achieved this quarter and for their commitment to driving improvements across the brand. And now, I'll turn the call over to Jen. Jennifer Foyle Thanks Chad and good morning everyone. Aerie delivered another great quarter posting a 25 comp increase. I'm pleased to report that this marks our 13th straight quarter of double-digit comp growth. The first quarter also reflected acceleration from the prior year and built on a 32% comp increase in the first quarter of last year. New to file customers increased and overall traffic to our brand both online and in-stores was up last year. Aerie's digital business was especially strong this quarter, showing rapid growth and accelerating from last year. This led to a 47% online penetration in the first quarter, up from 35% last year. Our online slim and bra shop were particularly strong, yet we also saw strength across a broad range of categories. We extended our slim collection this year adding new silhouette, more fashion and additional fits all of which have been extremely well received by our customers both in-store and online. Our new apparel collections led by Chill. Play. Move., posted very strong results this quarter and we continue to see strengths in our lightly lined bras and bralettes. We remain extremely excited by the ongoing opportunity to grow and expand the Aerie brand. Our Aerie real brand platforms continues to resonate with our customers. We look forward to building on our campaign and expanding the Aerie lifestyle with fresh assortments and new products season-after-season. New store growth is on-track and we are also working hard to take the customer experience to the next level. We are making sure we have the right talent at the store level to ensure an outstanding brand experience. I would like to thank my team for driving Aerie's ongoing success and for their great passion and hard work every day. Now, I'll turn it over to Bob. Robert Madore Thanks Jen and good morning everyone. Although we are dissatisfied to report earnings below last year, we managed the business through a tough quarter. In response to slower than expected start to the period and challenging mall traffic, our promotions increased pressuring margins. Yet we managed expenses well, generated healthy cash flow and saw a strong traffic and sales increases in our e-commerce business. In addition to the many positives across the brand as called out by Chad and Jen, we saw improvement in consolidated traffic and transactions and the conversion rates in-stores and online increased the last year. Now looking more closely at the details of the quarter. Total revenue increased 2% to 762 million from 749 million last year. Comparable sales increased 2% for the period, total net revenue included approximately 5 million received from the termination of a license agreement with a third-party operator. Additional sales information can be found on pages six and seven of the supplemental online presentation. This quarter American Eagle comps were down 1% and Aerie comps increased 25%. The average transaction size declined in the low single-digits. This was offset by a mid single-digit increase in a number of transactions. Demand was slow to start the quarter yet business improved as the quarter progressed, which was highlighted by the positive Easter holiday and comp traffic up mid-single-digits in the quarter. The total gross profit decreased 5% to 278 million from 293 million last year. The gross margin declined 270 basis points to a rate of 36.5% of revenue. Increased promotional activity caused 200 basis points of decline. Buying, occupancy and warehousing deleveraged 70 basis points due primarily to increased shipping cost related to the e-commerce business in the quarter. SG&A dollar's decline 1% to 195 million as a rate to revenue SG&A expense improve 60 basis points to 25.6% from 26.2% last year. Higher advertising expense was offset by lower compensation expense and favorability across a number of other expense categories. Depreciation and amortization increased 1.6 million to $40 million and deleveraged 10 basis points to 5.3% as a rate of revenue. Adjusted operating income fell 28% to $42 million from $59 million last year and the operating margin declined 220 basis points to 5.6% as a rate to revenue. The effective tax rate decreased 32.4% compared to 36.4% last year reflecting the impact of discrete items this quarter. Adjusted EPS of $0.16 decreased 27% from $0.22 last year. Adjusted earnings excluding restructuring related charges of 5.4 million or approximately $0.02 per diluted share, this consisted primarily of severance and related charges corresponding the home office restructuring as well as our initiative to explore closure or conversation of Company owned and operating stores in Hong Kong, China and the United Kingdom to license partnerships. Now regarding inventory, which can be found on Page 8 of the online presentation. We ended the quarter with inventorial cost of 364 million up 9% from last year. Ending units were flat last year while the average unit cost was up 9%. The increase in cost per unit reflects a greater mix of AE jeans, bottoms and Aerie apparel driven from our merchandise strategies. Looking ahead, we expect second quarter ending inventorial cost to be up in the mid-single-digits. Capital expenditures totaled 40 million in the quarter and we continue to expect CapEx to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million for the year. Roughly half of the spend relates to the store remodeling projects and new openings and the balance to support the digital business, Omni channel tools and general corporate maintenance. During the quarter we returned a total of $110 million to shareholders including six million shares repurchased for $88 million. Additionally, we paid 22 million in cash dividends. 19 million shares remain authorized under the current repurchase program. We ended the quarter with 225 million in cash compared to 239 million last year. With ongoing traffic declines, we are continually reviewing the store fleet and focusing efforts on extracting store efficiencies and productivity. Our fleet is largely profitable, I want to emphasize that this is case across all mall types A, B, C malls as well as our outlet centers. However, when it makes sense where we are over stored and have a high likelihood of sales migration we are closing locations. We are also building flexibility into our lease terms with over 500 stores in-store leases set to expire in the next three years. This year we plan to close between 25 and 40 store locations. As previously discussed, we are selectively opening new Aerie stores and a handful of American Eagle stores in the U.S. and Mexico, where we believe we have opportunity. Internationally, the Company plans to open 45 and close two license store locations. Additional stores information could be found on Pages 11 through 13 in the online presentation. Now looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect second quarter earnings per share of $0.15 to $0.17 which is based on comparable sales of flat to a low-single-digit decline. The guidance assumes a lower merchandise margin due to increased promotions and a low-single-digit increase in SG&A dollars compared to last year. This compares that our earnings per share of $0.23 last year and excludes potential impairment and restructuring charges. We remain focused on our strategic priorities centered on improving the customer experience and engagement with our brands. We are also creating efficiencies and strong financial disciplines to strengthen the bottom line and deliver shareholder returns. Thanks and now will take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Oliver Chen I just wanted to ask about the store footprint and if you can get recaptures, will you potentially decide to close at a faster rate and what are some of the guard rails for thinking about that in terms of or how that may proceed versus your annual program of 25 to 40, just we are thinking about how to optimize this and what can happen especially as your online business has been leading and growing nicely? Thank you. Chad Kessler Yes, sure. Oliver. As I had pointed out in my prepared remarks, we are constantly evaluating our store footprint in the real-estate portfolio, although we have given some guidance for the year, we are looking to get more aggressive with store closings. we have been experimenting with closures of stores where we are able to really track sales migration and really analyze the relationship of the stores to our digital business. I mean just to point out a couple of things, within our stores base it is the best place for us to drive new customer acquisitions still and 80% of our online returns get returned back to stores right. So they are very close interplay between brick-and-mortar and digital, although you may be seeing continued traffic declines in-stores and comp decreases in certain-stores. Those stores are still very profitable. Although they may not be profitable at a four wall rate that they experienced three-four years ago. They are driving very significant four wall profits and that's across all mall grades, A, B, C, outlet malls et cetera. But the short answer to your question is, yes we are looking to get a little more aggressive in our store closures than what we have communicated thus far as we continue to go through our market assessments. Oliver Chen Okay and on the inventory number, is it updated. Jay Schottenstein Okay, just to add to that. We want to do it in a smart way, so when we do close the store we pick up those sales, we pick up those profits. We just don't want to close stores and close stores. We want to figure out how to optimize and maximize the sales, so when we do close we are able to keep the majority of it. Operator Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer and Company, please proceed with your question. Anna Andreeva Great, thanks so much and good morning everyone. Question on the second quarter comp guide, flat to down low-singles. I guess what is driving deterioration versus positive 1Q, what kind of promotional pressure are you guys expecting during the second quarter and Bob maybe talk about your comfort with inventory levels, what is driving the mid-single-digit increase ending 2Q. Thanks so much. Robert Madore Yes, so related to the revenue guidance that we gave for the quarter, it's really based upon what we are seeing quarter-to-date in trends across channel, I would tell you the guidance is comprised of significant improvements or increases continuing in digital and brick-and-mortar continuing to be feeling slight pressure in comps, but it's very much in-line with not only trends we are seeing currently, but what we anticipate for the remainder of the quarter. From an inventory perspective, what is really driving that is you know when we announced earnings at the end of Q4 at year-end inventory levels were up 17%. When we guided to inventory levels at that point in time for the end of Q1, we believe that we were going to be closer about 12% we ended the quarter up 9%, so better than what we had anticipated in the beginning of the quarter. Looking forward, we are continuing to decrease inventory levels to get them better or more aligned with sales performance. Having said that we have made strategic investments across roughly three product categories in the AE brand, in denim, and long bottoms and within the Aerie brand within the overall apparel category, all of which drive higher AUCs in those businesses particularly when you talk bottoms and denim are extremely skew extensive. You are talking multiple fabrics, multiple colors, multiple sizes et cetera, so to make sure you're in business in-line with the merchandizing strategies we have particularly as we start moving into back-to-school season, building inventories this summer that’s really what was driving inventory. You know inventory units at the end of Q1 were flat. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura / Instinet. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Siegel Have you guys sized the top-line opportunity for Aerie, how large can you see the business growing, what does that do for Company level margins and then just what is the general break down of product penetration with any Aerie at this point. And Jay can you just share you view on the mall landscape, any thoughts on the competitive dynamics and may be any views on consolidation within the industry. Thanks. Jennifer Foyle Sure, thank you Simeon, we are really excited about the Aerie potential, we are not going to stop, I say this on every call and there is a pass few actually more than a $1 billion easily. What I love about the Aerie composition is that we are not just about bras and undies, which I always will say, that’s our core competency business, but we have new product categories Swim, Chill. Play. Move., and all those categories is really resonating with the customer, they are loving these new product offerings. And it allows us also to post and ebb and flow when various product categories are down trending. So I love that ability in Aerie. That said, bras and undies will still be well positioned at roughly 60% of the business and then the depending on the seasonality, we will post Swim and/or the apparel categories. Chad Kessler I mean just to add to that, there is a lot of white space within the Aerie world, today from a store portfolio prospective we only have a 103 standalone Aerie stores, so where some people may say we are over stored in AE, we are significantly under stored as it relates to Aerie. In addition to the standalone stores, we have owned 92 side-by-side Aerie location, so those are stores that are adjacent connected to AE stores. So very small store base that we feel gives us an opportunity to be extremely selective in the locations and the markets we are not in and we are not deeply penetrating today. You couple that with the relationship we see between brick-and-mortar retail presence and digital business that’s driven by that, just to highlight what Jen said, we think Aerie represents a large growth opportunity for the Company. And Jay do you want to handle the mall? Jay Schottenstein I was walking the mall yesterday, we still see a lot of stores with sings 40 off as far as the entire store, it's not a secret, there have been a lot of stores closing in like the last couple of months, I think 3800 sites closed, so we have to go to fight that. At the same time, our challenge is how do we make our customer feel more special. And now we work on every day, we are challenging ourselves whether it would be adding certain product lines in and what can we do to make a better shopping experience. And also we are investing in the technology to keep our mobile site very exciting too. So this is what you call this is the year of the disruption and its challenging but our people are up to it and most important thing is that we still see up a majority opportunity is out there. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Boss Thanks. On the gross margin front, how should we think about promotional mark down pressure versus IMU in both the second quarter and the back half of the year? And then just larger picture, as DTC continues to grow what would be the offsets to the mix headwinds on a multiyear basis. Robert Madore Yes. So on gross margin we anticipate gross margin pressure in the second quarter pretty consistent with what we experienced in Q1. We anticipate slight IMU improvement through continued cost reductions on like-for-like products, but we do anticipate and were currently seeing a continuation in the overall promotional environment. So I think you can expect gross margin pressures comparable to what we saw in Q2. And then related to the larger picture directions soon we continues to grow what were the options be on a headwinds basis, so we are experiencing very significant growth in our e-commerce business. This last quarter, huge traffic increase quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year and it's a very significant transaction growth year-over-year. We are going to continue to leverage, we are going to drive that growth. We have been very successful in a lot of our digital marketing initiatives, a lot of the investments as Jay pointed out that we have made in our e-commerce business on really enhancing the experience with the consumer optimizing our order management systems to really leverage our omni-channel capabilities are really translating and registering within the performance of the overall digital business. So we are obviously going to continue to capitalize on that, we have had a question and a little bit of dialogue on this call around potentially accelerating our store closures from what we have communicated thus far. we are constantly analyzing the portfolio from a store-by-store and in overall market perspective to determine where we feel we are over stored et cetera. So we are going to continue to drive digital the way we have and we are going to continue to drive rationalization of the real-estate portfolio, but at the same time driving improvement in-store productivity across the remainder of the fleet. Jay Schottenstein And also Bob it’s also very important to point to point out that when it comes to our core strength in our denim is getting stronger. Robert Madore Yes. Across all channels. Jay Schottenstein That's right, men's and women's brands are getting stronger. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Brian Tunick Two questions. I guess maybe Jay there has been a lot of media reports about consolidation probably much needed in the apparel sector. So I was just curious if you could remind us on your capital allocation thoughts and your balance sheet priorities. And then maybe for Chad, can you talk about the lead times on fixing the men's business on the women's strength where do you think your share gains are coming from? Thanks very much. Jay Schottenstein To give my answer, we have always said that we have a policy. I'm not commenting on rumors or speculation, this remains our response. Robert Madore And just a little more on capital allocation and we have been pretty consistent with our strategy around this. Obviously we focus first and foremost on investing in our business, I think we have demonstrated that with where we have target our capital expense dollars over the year and I think it's really produce very significant returns across that channel in particular. So we are going to continue to invest in our business where those investments are going to drive an appropriate level of return then beyond that obviously we look to return or provide returns to shareholders. This quarter, we provided about a 110 million of total returns to shareholders via dividends and the 88 million in share buybacks. For share buybacks in particular, the one strategy that we have pretty consistently followed is that we are constantly looking to mitigate any EPS dilution related to accretion in share count. That's a starting point, beyond that we obviously look for opportunistic buying opportunities relative to our share price, fee multiples where we think that we are undervalued relative to our performance versus the remainder of the sector that we participate in. So that's a constant evaluation that we do and that's really how we prioritize our capital allocation strategy. Chad Kessler Hey Brian, this is Chad jumping in on a question in men's and women's. I think it's really important to think about first what our total strategy is. I think when I look at the future and how brands are going to evolve and how brands are going to be successful, I think it’s going to be about being famous for a category and being a destination. And for us that category is jeans and from jeans overall bottoms, but really everyday what we are focused on primarily is what can we do to drive the bottoms business and what are the right tops to go with that bottoms business. So when I look at the total men's business, the bottoms business continues to be very healthy, the bottoms business had a record Q1 and the tops business we talked about had been more challenged. We are definitely very focused on making sure we have the right tops to go with the bottoms and the right tops that our customers looking for. I think I said in the last call, we have hired a new head of men's merchandizing, in Q1 we brought on board a new head of men's design. In addition to that we utilizing Todd Schneider and the business to help with the assortment, he has been very involved in holiday. So we are seeing some early improvement out there, in some of the niche businesses we are starting to see some strength, but we are not counting on that to start showing up out until the back half. So it is very early days, we are starting to see some improvement, but I think it's going to take a little time for that to show up. In terms of women’s and where the share is coming from, I think it's coming from all over I think the bottoms business is driving customers in and she is finding that she can get the exact right tops to go with the bottoms when she is in the store. There are a lot of competitors out there that are giving up share and we are picking it up from whomever we can. Operator Thank you, our next question comes from the line of John Morris with BMO Capital Markets, please proceed with your question. John Morris Thanks, maybe if you can give us an update on the marketing campaigns and the loyalty programs. Some of those initiatives that I think you have in the place and where we are on those, and I think coupled with that the work that you guys have been doing on the new prototype stores, some updates there, modernizing the experience et cetera. Chad Kessler Sure, we are excited to see how the real campaign continues to evolve for AE, for back-to-school we are very focused on then on speaking very clearly and loudly to our customer about all the benefits that AE jeans have to offer, we really believe with the center of everything that we do. Kyle has brought on some fantastic talent, plus our digital marketing team, a new creative director, she has really strengthened that team and I think we are going to have a much more effective communications strategy to the customers going into back-to-school. And in terms of the store experience, it’s something we will continue to be working on, we are actually presenting at the [indiscernible] letter today. It’s something of a prototype that we have get to work on. And I think as Jay mentioned, creating great customer experiences is very important part of what the stores will be as we go forward. Bob talked about stores being a critical place of customer acquisition and also an important part of the e-commerce channel because they handle exchanges and returns. And so having a great experience and having a great definition is important. Loyalty, our new loyalty program will be launching at the end of back-to-school right at the beginning of September. So the new program is digital its tide more into our strategies of driving bottoms and bras and gent’s world and it can be a much better experience for the customer. So we are excited for that to launch. Jennifer Foyle And the Aerie real campaign is spectacular what we are doing here. I really would say that we own the body positivity platform, it's so interesting to see what a global impact that’s having on just, you read the news and it's just this is a way a life today and I would say even more so than bralettes we claimed and we own this and this is our brand DNA. So I'm really proud of the work the team has done here. Again, our customer base grew 13% and we continue to grow double-digits, so obviously this campaign is resonating. But what I love about the Aerie real campaign is it's not just how we portray our brand from the outside, it's what happens on the inside and how everyday this team lives by the DNA of our brand and without that the customer wouldn’t feel the impact. So there is so many new ways we are looking out how to excite the customer, using Aerie real at the helm and there is a lot of surprises on the way. So we are really excited what this campaign is feeling. And based on the store experience, if you have not been to the Spring Street store please go, it’s a pop up store, there for a year a little bit more than a pop up I would say and it's amazing, I was there on Saturday, we had music and we had a customization machine making T-shirts, I couldn’t believe the output, I personally made 20 myself, and it was just a blast. And what is that store is doing for the customer, we are definitely going to pluck some ideas from that and build on that of the learning we are seeing at Spring Street. So it's an incredible experience and as Jay mentioned, it's so important today to surprise your customer with something different and I think this experience is truly unique. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research. Please proceed with your question. Janet Kloppenburg Good morning everyone. And Jen that story is quite beautiful in SoHo, congrats on that. So both Jen and Chad, I was wondering if you could talk about margins trends, across the broad for you Jen what kind of emotional pressures you are seeing. And Chad it sounds like most of the pressure is coming from the tops category, I think men's and women's, but also if you could comment about your margins trends in bottoms that would be helpful. And just on the lease renegotiations where you could share your thoughts, is it meaningful enough to help us think that the deleverage on buying and occupancy that that point of deleverage could improve as we look forward? Thank you. Chad Kessler So I think in terms of margins and the promotional environment, as you know it's been very tough out there. February was a tough month for everybody and so we started the season - the quarter over the tough month and we had to get a little more promotional then we like to be to get through to drive the top-line and keep our inventories cleans, I think we give that successfully. So we delivered a good top-line, our inventories are cleaner than we had anticipated coming out of the quarter, we believe that that's going to continue in the Q2. The bottoms margins are very healthy, we had very strong margins in Q1, record margins back in Q1 in men's and women's bottom. So that business continues to be very healthy, the top business we are at a little more pressured, it's good than more seasonal and the men's business as you know has been slower. So we do anticipate promotions continuing at a similar rate going into Q2. But last Q1, you have to remember last Q1 was super clean. The promotions while to similar to Q1 should be more similar to last year in Q2. So I think that would be a shift to a season from the quarters. Jennifer Foyle And same for Aerie, Chad we had record high margins last year, but still the flow through was very healthy in Q1 in Aerie, still retail leading industry margins I would say, so we are pleased with that. And again, going back to our ability to remix into new businesses, some of the margin pressure was offset by some of the newer businesses Swim and Chill. Play. Move. Robert Madore Related to the lease negotiations and deleverage on buying, occupancy and warehousing. Pretty much all of the deleveraging with buying occupancy and warehousing was really related to online deliveries. So as that business continues to penetrate greater across the company total, so this quarter digital represented 26% of total sales versus 22% last year right. So becoming a more significant percentage. Digital itself was up significantly, if you look just at Jen’s Aerie business digital was up over 60% and it represents 47% of total sales in the quarter, right. So as that channel becomes a bigger percentage of our business and those transactions grow significantly, that's going to drive higher delivery expense associated with that. On the lease side of buying our occupancy, as I said, as we get more aggressive with our store closures, we are going to be able to minimize or eliminate any deleverage we are seeing with that fixed rents expense going forward. And then obviously any improvement in comps if brick-and-mortar obviously would leverage rents too right. So there is a number of initiatives and the things that we are looking to do or ways that the business is growing that are really impacting buying occupancy in warehousing in the aggregate. You really have to look at each of the elements separately. Operator Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI, please proceed with your question. Omar Saad Thanks good morning, thanks for taking my question. A couple of quick ones, wanted to see if you could elaborate on this kind of positive traffic number that you had in the quarter. You just don't hear a lot of companies talking about positive traffic with apparel exposure, mall exposure and maybe talk about what you think some of the key drivers were there and the sustainability of it. I think that's probably the best place to start. Thanks. Robert Madore Yes, I mean traffic vise yes we feel like one of the things that is going to make us stand out from a lot of our competition is an over our consolidated traffic increase. A big chunk of that is driven by our e-commerce business. Traffic in brick-and-mortar was down mid-single-digits, but if you look at the digital business it was up in the 20s. So very significant traffic increase in digital. I think it speaks to a lot of our new digital marketing efforts that are producing very good returns, I think Chad mentioned, Kyle really upgrading that team and that team really instituting some great marketing campaigns and traffic drivers that translated in the performance we saw. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi, please proceed with your question. Paul Lejuez Just try and understand, is the simple issue you think that you guys are seeing as you put more make into the product, units flat even per dollars up more, that you're just not getting paid for what you're doing to the product in terms of the quality improvements you're making. And if that is kind of the simple issue what adjustments do you make to the product going forward, does it say something about your customers’ willingness to accept what you're doing, is it a competitive landscape issue, may be both just if you could talk on that a bit. Thanks. Jay Schottenstein I actually don't think that we are putting too much in the product and I think the customer continues to pay for and respond to better product, discussed a lot of the growth and the inventory cost is driven by the mix in the bottom, which that is our category and we are not going to apologize for investing in bottoms, we are going to drive this business. we are going to continue to put stuff in the process. Sorry. But we are going to continue invest in the products, we are going to continue to invest in bottoms, bottoms is our number one strategy and that's going to likely mix AUC up. In terms of women's tops, we continue to invest more in the product and we are getting I think paid for that, we continue to. And then in men's is the one place where we maybe reached a little too far with some of the ticket prices without seeing the demand there so we have actually made some strategic adjustments to some of the men's tickets as we try to gain back share. But part of the way that we won for the past three years is by investing in product, offering a better value to the customer and investing in bottoms and we are going to continue to do that. And I think the Q1-to-Q1 promotional activity is hardly just tough compared to the last year, it was such a clean quarter and now also the slow start to this year but. We continue to invest in the product and we are able to do that because we continue to see like-for-like cost improvement and our goal is to offer the customer the best value we can. Paul Lejuez Well also Chad, could you talk about the technology too? Chad Kessler Yes and I think, within out bottoms category we continue to innovate the bottoms fabric that we are delivering in jeans, I think we offer fabrication that you are only going to get at American Eagle and then at premium competitors. No one else in our space has the bottom technology and innovations that we have and we will continue to invest and innovate there with new higher performance fabric and stretches. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Binetti Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of our questions has been answered, but I just wanted to ask any commentary on your early thoughts on the trends and the malls maybe where you have seen an anchor vacate a mall. Robert Madore With some of the major anchors that have announced closures, the good news is out of our entire real estate portfolio, we don’t have a significant number of locations in those mall. But where we do and where the store has closed, we have not seen a traffic trend that is significantly different to our store, which is significantly different than what we are seeing across that mall grade average generally speaking. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Susan Anderson Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about any reduction that you’re seeing in rent, it sounds like may be even some of the A malls are starting to get some reduction, now so just wanted to get your thoughts on that and then just any analysis that when you're looking at the store closures on the sales we can generate, so the sales that you're keeping either online or in other store. Thanks. Robert Madore Yes. So I think you're right, I think in light of the environment, in light of the continued year-over-year traffic declines, I think even within some of the A mall developer community, there is an understanding that they can’t necessary command the rent increases that they historically experienced, not to mention, maintain rents at current levels. It's really on a case-by-case, developer-by-developer circumstance. But yes we obviously pursue that where it makes sense. We are have very good partnerships with our mall developers, but where it make sense in light of performance. In light of in some instances, when we enter the mall we had a particular foot print that competed specifically with us, in some instances where we find that there are more competitors now in the mall than there were when we initially entered the location that’s very good ammunition for that kind of conversation that I was mentioning is one example. And when we are looking at store closures and we have got experience with sales migration and transfer, it's pretty successful relative to most of what we have heard in the market. I'm not going to close this specific percentage of sales but depending on the market and store adjacencies in our density of real-estate within a marketplace, we can experience anywhere from 50% to 10% sales migration depending on a lot of different circumstances. We have a great CRM database that actually we feel is a competitive advantage and we are able to use that information and to help us to determine which stores to earmark for closure or not, where we feel will have the best success of sales migration and et cetera. We continue to fine tune that, we continue to build that database and our capabilities to analyze those things appropriately, but it's a big piece of our real-estate portfolio review and our overall portfolio strategy. Operator Thank you. Our final question for today will come from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question. Dana Telsey Good morning everyone. As you think about product costs and direct sourcing what are you seeing out there in terms of the ability for direct sourcing to be able to support product costs and its ability to drive the comp and where you are seeing raw material cost given the investments in higher quality lately? Thank you. Robert Madore I'll try to answer that first and Chad can jump in where he feels I missed something. But there is a number of things that are really positively impacting our ability to continue to drive unit costs reductions. One is just there is a lot of supply out there from a factory base perspective, which creates big opportunities. When we look at the percentage of our business that we go direct versus through agents that clearly represents an opportunity for us to further reduce cost as we look to change that model potentially or even use that as a I don’t want to say threat but a negotiating stents as we go forward. We continue to do things like increase our fabric plat forming and other sourcing strategies and initiatives that will continue to drive those cost decreases and we are doing a better job of just consolidating production within factories committing to capacity levels within factories that again all allow us to negotiate lower per unit cost going forward. So we see we still have further opportunity to drive that and we believe we have a number of levers to pull to get there. Chad Kessler The only thing I would add is I think we balance that, we want to offer the customer the best value. We want to pay the best price and we have been paying less unlike the garment and doing all of that we want to be even faster than we have been. So we are balancing those three things and see it has been something that we really, really improved over the last few years, that continues to help us to be more right with what the customer wants. All that should pay off. Robert Madore That's a great point Chad, because where we historically had place buys during particular timeframes. We have the ability to hold back on what our demand estimates are and not place those orders as early and we can hold back as much as 40% of a potential seasonal buy for just in time kind of delivery at that point so in chasing. So, yes building speed and flexibility into our sourcing production function has been a huge focus and representing additional opportunity going forward too.

At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Oliver Chen I just wanted to ask about the store footprint and if you can get recaptures, will you potentially decide to close at a faster rate and what are some of the guard rails for thinking about that in terms of or how that may proceed versus your annual program of 25 to 40, just we are thinking about how to optimize this and what can happen especially as your online business has been leading and growing nicely? Thank you. Chad Kessler Yes, sure. Oliver. As I had pointed out in my prepared remarks, we are constantly evaluating our store footprint in the real-estate portfolio, although we have given some guidance for the year, we are looking to get more aggressive with store closings. we have been experimenting with closures of stores where we are able to really track sales migration and really analyze the relationship of the stores to our digital business. I mean just to point out a couple of things, within our stores base it is the best place for us to drive new customer acquisitions still and 80% of our online returns get returned back to stores right. So they are very close interplay between brick-and-mortar and digital, although you may be seeing continued traffic declines in-stores and comp decreases in certain-stores. Those stores are still very profitable. Although they may not be profitable at a four wall rate that they experienced three-four years ago. They are driving very significant four wall profits and that's across all mall grades, A, B, C, outlet malls et cetera. But the short answer to your question is, yes we are looking to get a little more aggressive in our store closures than what we have communicated thus far as we continue to go through our market assessments. Oliver Chen Okay and on the inventory number, is it updated. Jay Schottenstein Okay, just to add to that. We want to do it in a smart way, so when we do close the store we pick up those sales, we pick up those profits. We just don't want to close stores and close stores. We want to figure out how to optimize and maximize the sales, so when we do close we are able to keep the majority of it. Operator Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer and Company, please proceed with your question. Anna Andreeva Great, thanks so much and good morning everyone. Question on the second quarter comp guide, flat to down low-singles. I guess what is driving deterioration versus positive 1Q, what kind of promotional pressure are you guys expecting during the second quarter and Bob maybe talk about your comfort with inventory levels, what is driving the mid-single-digit increase ending 2Q. Thanks so much. Robert Madore Yes, so related to the revenue guidance that we gave for the quarter, it's really based upon what we are seeing quarter-to-date in trends across channel, I would tell you the guidance is comprised of significant improvements or increases continuing in digital and brick-and-mortar continuing to be feeling slight pressure in comps, but it's very much in-line with not only trends we are seeing currently, but what we anticipate for the remainder of the quarter. From an inventory perspective, what is really driving that is you know when we announced earnings at the end of Q4 at year-end inventory levels were up 17%. When we guided to inventory levels at that point in time for the end of Q1, we believe that we were going to be closer about 12% we ended the quarter up 9%, so better than what we had anticipated in the beginning of the quarter. Looking forward, we are continuing to decrease inventory levels to get them better or more aligned with sales performance. Having said that we have made strategic investments across roughly three product categories in the AE brand, in denim, and long bottoms and within the Aerie brand within the overall apparel category, all of which drive higher AUCs in those businesses particularly when you talk bottoms and denim are extremely skew extensive. You are talking multiple fabrics, multiple colors, multiple sizes et cetera, so to make sure you're in business in-line with the merchandizing strategies we have particularly as we start moving into back-to-school season, building inventories this summer that’s really what was driving inventory. You know inventory units at the end of Q1 were flat. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura / Instinet. Please proceed with your question. Simeon Siegel Have you guys sized the top-line opportunity for Aerie, how large can you see the business growing, what does that do for Company level margins and then just what is the general break down of product penetration with any Aerie at this point. And Jay can you just share you view on the mall landscape, any thoughts on the competitive dynamics and may be any views on consolidation within the industry. Thanks. Jennifer Foyle Sure, thank you Simeon, we are really excited about the Aerie potential, we are not going to stop, I say this on every call and there is a pass few actually more than a $1 billion easily. What I love about the Aerie composition is that we are not just about bras and undies, which I always will say, that’s our core competency business, but we have new product categories Swim, Chill. Play. Move., and all those categories is really resonating with the customer, they are loving these new product offerings. And it allows us also to post and ebb and flow when various product categories are down trending. So I love that ability in Aerie. That said, bras and undies will still be well positioned at roughly 60% of the business and then the depending on the seasonality, we will post Swim and/or the apparel categories. Chad Kessler I mean just to add to that, there is a lot of white space within the Aerie world, today from a store portfolio prospective we only have a 103 standalone Aerie stores, so where some people may say we are over stored in AE, we are significantly under stored as it relates to Aerie. In addition to the standalone stores, we have owned 92 side-by-side Aerie location, so those are stores that are adjacent connected to AE stores. So very small store base that we feel gives us an opportunity to be extremely selective in the locations and the markets we are not in and we are not deeply penetrating today. You couple that with the relationship we see between brick-and-mortar retail presence and digital business that’s driven by that, just to highlight what Jen said, we think Aerie represents a large growth opportunity for the Company. And Jay do you want to handle the mall? Jay Schottenstein I was walking the mall yesterday, we still see a lot of stores with sings 40 off as far as the entire store, it's not a secret, there have been a lot of stores closing in like the last couple of months, I think 3800 sites closed, so we have to go to fight that. At the same time, our challenge is how do we make our customer feel more special. And now we work on every day, we are challenging ourselves whether it would be adding certain product lines in and what can we do to make a better shopping experience. And also we are investing in the technology to keep our mobile site very exciting too. So this is what you call this is the year of the disruption and its challenging but our people are up to it and most important thing is that we still see up a majority opportunity is out there. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Boss Thanks. On the gross margin front, how should we think about promotional mark down pressure versus IMU in both the second quarter and the back half of the year? And then just larger picture, as DTC continues to grow what would be the offsets to the mix headwinds on a multiyear basis. Robert Madore Yes. So on gross margin we anticipate gross margin pressure in the second quarter pretty consistent with what we experienced in Q1. We anticipate slight IMU improvement through continued cost reductions on like-for-like products, but we do anticipate and were currently seeing a continuation in the overall promotional environment. So I think you can expect gross margin pressures comparable to what we saw in Q2. And then related to the larger picture directions soon we continues to grow what were the options be on a headwinds basis, so we are experiencing very significant growth in our e-commerce business. This last quarter, huge traffic increase quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year and it's a very significant transaction growth year-over-year. We are going to continue to leverage, we are going to drive that growth. We have been very successful in a lot of our digital marketing initiatives, a lot of the investments as Jay pointed out that we have made in our e-commerce business on really enhancing the experience with the consumer optimizing our order management systems to really leverage our omni-channel capabilities are really translating and registering within the performance of the overall digital business. So we are obviously going to continue to capitalize on that, we have had a question and a little bit of dialogue on this call around potentially accelerating our store closures from what we have communicated thus far. we are constantly analyzing the portfolio from a store-by-store and in overall market perspective to determine where we feel we are over stored et cetera. So we are going to continue to drive digital the way we have and we are going to continue to drive rationalization of the real-estate portfolio, but at the same time driving improvement in-store productivity across the remainder of the fleet. Jay Schottenstein And also Bob it’s also very important to point to point out that when it comes to our core strength in our denim is getting stronger. Robert Madore Yes. Across all channels. Jay Schottenstein That's right, men's and women's brands are getting stronger. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Brian Tunick Two questions. I guess maybe Jay there has been a lot of media reports about consolidation probably much needed in the apparel sector. So I was just curious if you could remind us on your capital allocation thoughts and your balance sheet priorities. And then maybe for Chad, can you talk about the lead times on fixing the men's business on the women's strength where do you think your share gains are coming from? Thanks very much. Jay Schottenstein To give my answer, we have always said that we have a policy. I'm not commenting on rumors or speculation, this remains our response. Robert Madore And just a little more on capital allocation and we have been pretty consistent with our strategy around this. Obviously we focus first and foremost on investing in our business, I think we have demonstrated that with where we have target our capital expense dollars over the year and I think it's really produce very significant returns across that channel in particular. So we are going to continue to invest in our business where those investments are going to drive an appropriate level of return then beyond that obviously we look to return or provide returns to shareholders. This quarter, we provided about a 110 million of total returns to shareholders via dividends and the 88 million in share buybacks. For share buybacks in particular, the one strategy that we have pretty consistently followed is that we are constantly looking to mitigate any EPS dilution related to accretion in share count. That's a starting point, beyond that we obviously look for opportunistic buying opportunities relative to our share price, fee multiples where we think that we are undervalued relative to our performance versus the remainder of the sector that we participate in. So that's a constant evaluation that we do and that's really how we prioritize our capital allocation strategy. Chad Kessler Hey Brian, this is Chad jumping in on a question in men's and women's. I think it's really important to think about first what our total strategy is. I think when I look at the future and how brands are going to evolve and how brands are going to be successful, I think it’s going to be about being famous for a category and being a destination. And for us that category is jeans and from jeans overall bottoms, but really everyday what we are focused on primarily is what can we do to drive the bottoms business and what are the right tops to go with that bottoms business. So when I look at the total men's business, the bottoms business continues to be very healthy, the bottoms business had a record Q1 and the tops business we talked about had been more challenged. We are definitely very focused on making sure we have the right tops to go with the bottoms and the right tops that our customers looking for. I think I said in the last call, we have hired a new head of men's merchandizing, in Q1 we brought on board a new head of men's design. In addition to that we utilizing Todd Schneider and the business to help with the assortment, he has been very involved in holiday. So we are seeing some early improvement out there, in some of the niche businesses we are starting to see some strength, but we are not counting on that to start showing up out until the back half. So it is very early days, we are starting to see some improvement, but I think it's going to take a little time for that to show up. In terms of women’s and where the share is coming from, I think it's coming from all over I think the bottoms business is driving customers in and she is finding that she can get the exact right tops to go with the bottoms when she is in the store. There are a lot of competitors out there that are giving up share and we are picking it up from whomever we can. Operator Thank you, our next question comes from the line of John Morris with BMO Capital Markets, please proceed with your question. John Morris Thanks, maybe if you can give us an update on the marketing campaigns and the loyalty programs. Some of those initiatives that I think you have in the place and where we are on those, and I think coupled with that the work that you guys have been doing on the new prototype stores, some updates there, modernizing the experience et cetera. Chad Kessler Sure, we are excited to see how the real campaign continues to evolve for AE, for back-to-school we are very focused on then on speaking very clearly and loudly to our customer about all the benefits that AE jeans have to offer, we really believe with the center of everything that we do. Kyle has brought on some fantastic talent, plus our digital marketing team, a new creative director, she has really strengthened that team and I think we are going to have a much more effective communications strategy to the customers going into back-to-school. And in terms of the store experience, it’s something we will continue to be working on, we are actually presenting at the [indiscernible] letter today. It’s something of a prototype that we have get to work on. And I think as Jay mentioned, creating great customer experiences is very important part of what the stores will be as we go forward. Bob talked about stores being a critical place of customer acquisition and also an important part of the e-commerce channel because they handle exchanges and returns. And so having a great experience and having a great definition is important. Loyalty, our new loyalty program will be launching at the end of back-to-school right at the beginning of September. So the new program is digital its tide more into our strategies of driving bottoms and bras and gent’s world and it can be a much better experience for the customer. So we are excited for that to launch. Jennifer Foyle And the Aerie real campaign is spectacular what we are doing here. I really would say that we own the body positivity platform, it's so interesting to see what a global impact that’s having on just, you read the news and it's just this is a way a life today and I would say even more so than bralettes we claimed and we own this and this is our brand DNA. So I'm really proud of the work the team has done here. Again, our customer base grew 13% and we continue to grow double-digits, so obviously this campaign is resonating. But what I love about the Aerie real campaign is it's not just how we portray our brand from the outside, it's what happens on the inside and how everyday this team lives by the DNA of our brand and without that the customer wouldn’t feel the impact. So there is so many new ways we are looking out how to excite the customer, using Aerie real at the helm and there is a lot of surprises on the way. So we are really excited what this campaign is feeling. And based on the store experience, if you have not been to the Spring Street store please go, it’s a pop up store, there for a year a little bit more than a pop up I would say and it's amazing, I was there on Saturday, we had music and we had a customization machine making T-shirts, I couldn’t believe the output, I personally made 20 myself, and it was just a blast. And what is that store is doing for the customer, we are definitely going to pluck some ideas from that and build on that of the learning we are seeing at Spring Street. So it's an incredible experience and as Jay mentioned, it's so important today to surprise your customer with something different and I think this experience is truly unique. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research. Please proceed with your question. Janet Kloppenburg Good morning everyone. And Jen that story is quite beautiful in SoHo, congrats on that. So both Jen and Chad, I was wondering if you could talk about margins trends, across the broad for you Jen what kind of emotional pressures you are seeing. And Chad it sounds like most of the pressure is coming from the tops category, I think men's and women's, but also if you could comment about your margins trends in bottoms that would be helpful. And just on the lease renegotiations where you could share your thoughts, is it meaningful enough to help us think that the deleverage on buying and occupancy that that point of deleverage could improve as we look forward? Thank you. Chad Kessler So I think in terms of margins and the promotional environment, as you know it's been very tough out there. February was a tough month for everybody and so we started the season - the quarter over the tough month and we had to get a little more promotional then we like to be to get through to drive the top-line and keep our inventories cleans, I think we give that successfully. So we delivered a good top-line, our inventories are cleaner than we had anticipated coming out of the quarter, we believe that that's going to continue in the Q2. The bottoms margins are very healthy, we had very strong margins in Q1, record margins back in Q1 in men's and women's bottom. So that business continues to be very healthy, the top business we are at a little more pressured, it's good than more seasonal and the men's business as you know has been slower. So we do anticipate promotions continuing at a similar rate going into Q2. But last Q1, you have to remember last Q1 was super clean. The promotions while to similar to Q1 should be more similar to last year in Q2. So I think that would be a shift to a season from the quarters. Jennifer Foyle And same for Aerie, Chad we had record high margins last year, but still the flow through was very healthy in Q1 in Aerie, still retail leading industry margins I would say, so we are pleased with that. And again, going back to our ability to remix into new businesses, some of the margin pressure was offset by some of the newer businesses Swim and Chill. Play. Move. Robert Madore Related to the lease negotiations and deleverage on buying, occupancy and warehousing. Pretty much all of the deleveraging with buying occupancy and warehousing was really related to online deliveries. So as that business continues to penetrate greater across the company total, so this quarter digital represented 26% of total sales versus 22% last year right. So becoming a more significant percentage. Digital itself was up significantly, if you look just at Jen’s Aerie business digital was up over 60% and it represents 47% of total sales in the quarter, right. So as that channel becomes a bigger percentage of our business and those transactions grow significantly, that's going to drive higher delivery expense associated with that. On the lease side of buying our occupancy, as I said, as we get more aggressive with our store closures, we are going to be able to minimize or eliminate any deleverage we are seeing with that fixed rents expense going forward. And then obviously any improvement in comps if brick-and-mortar obviously would leverage rents too right. So there is a number of initiatives and the things that we are looking to do or ways that the business is growing that are really impacting buying occupancy in warehousing in the aggregate. You really have to look at each of the elements separately. Operator Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI, please proceed with your question. Omar Saad Thanks good morning, thanks for taking my question. A couple of quick ones, wanted to see if you could elaborate on this kind of positive traffic number that you had in the quarter. You just don't hear a lot of companies talking about positive traffic with apparel exposure, mall exposure and maybe talk about what you think some of the key drivers were there and the sustainability of it. I think that's probably the best place to start. Thanks. Robert Madore Yes, I mean traffic vise yes we feel like one of the things that is going to make us stand out from a lot of our competition is an over our consolidated traffic increase. A big chunk of that is driven by our e-commerce business. Traffic in brick-and-mortar was down mid-single-digits, but if you look at the digital business it was up in the 20s. So very significant traffic increase in digital. I think it speaks to a lot of our new digital marketing efforts that are producing very good returns, I think Chad mentioned, Kyle really upgrading that team and that team really instituting some great marketing campaigns and traffic drivers that translated in the performance we saw. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi, please proceed with your question. Paul Lejuez Just try and understand, is the simple issue you think that you guys are seeing as you put more make into the product, units flat even per dollars up more, that you're just not getting paid for what you're doing to the product in terms of the quality improvements you're making. And if that is kind of the simple issue what adjustments do you make to the product going forward, does it say something about your customers’ willingness to accept what you're doing, is it a competitive landscape issue, may be both just if you could talk on that a bit. Thanks. Jay Schottenstein I actually don't think that we are putting too much in the product and I think the customer continues to pay for and respond to better product, discussed a lot of the growth and the inventory cost is driven by the mix in the bottom, which that is our category and we are not going to apologize for investing in bottoms, we are going to drive this business. we are going to continue to put stuff in the process. Sorry. But we are going to continue invest in the products, we are going to continue to invest in bottoms, bottoms is our number one strategy and that's going to likely mix AUC up. In terms of women's tops, we continue to invest more in the product and we are getting I think paid for that, we continue to. And then in men's is the one place where we maybe reached a little too far with some of the ticket prices without seeing the demand there so we have actually made some strategic adjustments to some of the men's tickets as we try to gain back share. But part of the way that we won for the past three years is by investing in product, offering a better value to the customer and investing in bottoms and we are going to continue to do that. And I think the Q1-to-Q1 promotional activity is hardly just tough compared to the last year, it was such a clean quarter and now also the slow start to this year but. We continue to invest in the product and we are able to do that because we continue to see like-for-like cost improvement and our goal is to offer the customer the best value we can. Paul Lejuez Well also Chad, could you talk about the technology too? Chad Kessler Yes and I think, within out bottoms category we continue to innovate the bottoms fabric that we are delivering in jeans, I think we offer fabrication that you are only going to get at American Eagle and then at premium competitors. No one else in our space has the bottom technology and innovations that we have and we will continue to invest and innovate there with new higher performance fabric and stretches. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Binetti Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of our questions has been answered, but I just wanted to ask any commentary on your early thoughts on the trends and the malls maybe where you have seen an anchor vacate a mall. Robert Madore With some of the major anchors that have announced closures, the good news is out of our entire real estate portfolio, we don’t have a significant number of locations in those mall. But where we do and where the store has closed, we have not seen a traffic trend that is significantly different to our store, which is significantly different than what we are seeing across that mall grade average generally speaking. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Susan Anderson Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about any reduction that you’re seeing in rent, it sounds like may be even some of the A malls are starting to get some reduction, now so just wanted to get your thoughts on that and then just any analysis that when you're looking at the store closures on the sales we can generate, so the sales that you're keeping either online or in other store. Thanks. Robert Madore Yes. So I think you're right, I think in light of the environment, in light of the continued year-over-year traffic declines, I think even within some of the A mall developer community, there is an understanding that they can’t necessary command the rent increases that they historically experienced, not to mention, maintain rents at current levels. It's really on a case-by-case, developer-by-developer circumstance. But yes we obviously pursue that where it makes sense. We are have very good partnerships with our mall developers, but where it make sense in light of performance. In light of in some instances, when we enter the mall we had a particular foot print that competed specifically with us, in some instances where we find that there are more competitors now in the mall than there were when we initially entered the location that’s very good ammunition for that kind of conversation that I was mentioning is one example. And when we are looking at store closures and we have got experience with sales migration and transfer, it's pretty successful relative to most of what we have heard in the market. I'm not going to close this specific percentage of sales but depending on the market and store adjacencies in our density of real-estate within a marketplace, we can experience anywhere from 50% to 10% sales migration depending on a lot of different circumstances. We have a great CRM database that actually we feel is a competitive advantage and we are able to use that information and to help us to determine which stores to earmark for closure or not, where we feel will have the best success of sales migration and et cetera. We continue to fine tune that, we continue to build that database and our capabilities to analyze those things appropriately, but it's a big piece of our real-estate portfolio review and our overall portfolio strategy. Operator Thank you. Our final question for today will come from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question. Dana Telsey Good morning everyone. As you think about product costs and direct sourcing what are you seeing out there in terms of the ability for direct sourcing to be able to support product costs and its ability to drive the comp and where you are seeing raw material cost given the investments in higher quality lately? Thank you. Robert Madore I'll try to answer that first and Chad can jump in where he feels I missed something. But there is a number of things that are really positively impacting our ability to continue to drive unit costs reductions. One is just there is a lot of supply out there from a factory base perspective, which creates big opportunities. When we look at the percentage of our business that we go direct versus through agents that clearly represents an opportunity for us to further reduce cost as we look to change that model potentially or even use that as a I don’t want to say threat but a negotiating stents as we go forward. We continue to do things like increase our fabric plat forming and other sourcing strategies and initiatives that will continue to drive those cost decreases and we are doing a better job of just consolidating production within factories committing to capacity levels within factories that again all allow us to negotiate lower per unit cost going forward. So we see we still have further opportunity to drive that and we believe we have a number of levers to pull to get there. Chad Kessler The only thing I would add is I think we balance that, we want to offer the customer the best value. We want to pay the best price and we have been paying less unlike the garment and doing all of that we want to be even faster than we have been. So we are balancing those three things and see it has been something that we really, really improved over the last few years, that continues to help us to be more right with what the customer wants. All that should pay off. Robert Madore That's a great point Chad, because where we historically had place buys during particular timeframes. We have the ability to hold back on what our demand estimates are and not place those orders as early and we can hold back as much as 40% of a potential seasonal buy for just in time kind of delivery at that point so in chasing. So, yes building speed and flexibility into our sourcing production function has been a huge focus and representing additional opportunity going forward too.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on May 2, 2017. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. Also please note that all growth rates references will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai performed well in the first quarter with solid growth on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue in Q1 was $609 million, up 8% year-over-year; our strongest year-over-year growth rate in several quarters. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.69 per diluted share, up 5% year-over-year. Our strong results were driven by our Performance and Security Solutions with revenue growth of 18% over Q1 of 2016. These solutions accounted for over 60% of our overall revenue in Q1 and they contributed very attractive margins. As we discussed at our recent Investor Summit, the EBITDA margin profile for our Performance and Security Solutions has been about 50%. And this figure includes the substantial investments we made last year to innovate and bring compelling new products to market. For example, Ion 3.0, which we launched last month, dramatically improves the mobile experience for end users. For a customer like ZALORA, an Asian fashion retailer, mobile performance is critical because a significant amount of their business comes from mobile users. With Ion 3.0, ZALORA performance was 225% faster over cellular and 250% faster over Wi-Fi. That has translated into higher sales for them and a better experience for their customers. Through our recent acquisition of SOASTA, Ion is now complemented with two exciting new products: mPulse and CloudTest. These innovative solutions will provide our customers with the ability to measure, validate, and improve the business impact of their websites and applications. For example, Lowe's use the full suite of SOASTA capabilities to correlate site performance with sales and then drive e-commerce sales to over $1 billion through increased traffic and conversion rates. On the security front, scale has become critical as typical attacks now contain tens or hundreds of gigabits per second of malicious traffic, more than enough to overwhelm the traditional defenses of even the most well-equipped data centers. To address this expanding threat, we launched Kona Site Defender 5.0 and Web Application Protector in Q1. The new version of Kona Site Defender includes protection for API end points to help secure websites, mobile infrastructure and other API-driven requests. Web Application Protector is designed for the mid-market, providing customers with low touch and virtually maintenance-free protection from the most common DDoS and Web application attacks. We also launched Bot Manager 2.0 earlier this quarter. The new version of Bot Manager features enhanced bot detection and mitigation, along with advanced policy enforcement capabilities. This summer, we expect to further enhance Bot Manager to include innovative machine learning capabilities to better stop account takeover attacks. This technology was obtained in part through our recent acquisition of Cyberfend. We're also planning to bring new enterprise security and networking products to market this year. Our vision for these products is to secure, optimize and accelerate the enterprise network as a service in the cloud. We're doing this by utilizing the power of the Akamai platform to support new services that are simple to understand and easy-to-use, allow customers to try before they buy, allow for a land and expand sales motion, and to create synergies with the rest of our product portfolio. For example, at our recent Investor Summit, we demonstrated our new service for securing access to enterprise applications. Enterprise Application Access, or EAA, leverages software obtained through our recent acquisition of Soha Systems. It addresses the growing need for businesses to more easily and securely manage application access for a growing mix of users with different risk profiles without poking holes in the enterprise firewall. EAA is easy to deploy and simple to manage. Customers can implement it in minutes and then take advantage of Akamai's other performance and security solutions for all their internal applications. At the Investor Summit, we also demonstrated another exciting new offering called Enterprise Threat Protector or ETP. ETP is designed to protect enterprise employees and infrastructure against phishing, malware and data exfiltration attacks by providing a cloud-based recursive DNS service to block access to malware sites and data exfiltration botnets. It's currently in beta with 17 customers, all of whom are able to self integrate and use the product to block malware that evaded their other security systems. ETP is expected to launch this summer. Branch Accelerator is also now in beta. For users in the branch, their enterprise connectivity to the Internet may not be sufficient to support video or downloads without impinging on their ability to do other kinds of work. Branch Accelerator puts Akamai's software in or near the branch office to provide caching, enforce quality of service and ensure protocol optimization, all with the goal of improving branch performance. Our enterprise business is just getting started, and I expect significant growth ahead as we ramp up and launch these new products. Next, I'd like to talk about our Media business. As we discussed in our analyst calls over the last year, our Media business continues to be heavily impacted by the do-it-yourself efforts of six of the largest Internet platform companies. Our Q1 revenue from these companies was $51 million, a 29% decrease over Q1 of 2016. Traffic from our other media customers has continued to grow at a rapid rate, but at a slower pace than we've seen historically. As we discussed in the past, media traffic growth rates are highly variable over time and depend on a variety of factors. Pricing in the media sector remains aggressive, but the rate and pace of price declines continue to be in line with historical trends. The net effect of all these factors is that as we look forward to the rest of 2017, we believe that the revenue growth rate for our Media business will continue to be below the growth rates we've historically seen and that the growth rate for Akamai's overall revenues and margins will continue to be impacted as a result. That said, I want to be very clear that I believe Media is a good business for Akamai and that it has a very bright future. Over the longer term, I believe that the impact of the large platform companies on our Media business will lessen and that the business overall will return to historical levels of performance. One of the reasons for my optimism is our OTT business. A recent study predicts that over-the-top viewing will exceed traditional broadcast viewing within five years. Even if this prediction is only approximately correct, there is the potential for a very large amount of video traffic to move online and Akamai is very well-positioned to benefit as a result. At last week's National Association of Broadcasters, or NAB convention in Las Vegas, I met with executives from several of the world's leading media companies, and they were all talking about the growing demand for OTT content and how Akamai solutions can and do meet their needs. At NAB, we demonstrated two new products that dramatically improve the OTT experience for viewers: Media Services Live and Media Acceleration. Media Services Live was recognized with two awards in the convention. Streaming Media named it as one of six Best of NAB winners. And TV Technology presented Media Services Live with a Best of Show award. Media Services Live features breakthrough technology designed to eliminate the large latencies that are typical with Internet streaming, resulting in a viewer experience that is comparable to or better than traditional broadcast TV. We recently used this new solution to deliver nearly 100 million live video streams for a major sporting event with a 100% ingestion success rate and greater than 99.99% availability for viewers. In addition, we recently launched our new Media Acceleration capability to more efficiently communicate between end-user devices and the Akamai network, thereby providing a much higher-quality video experience for viewers. When Media Acceleration was used for a recent major sporting event, we achieved 72% fewer video start errors, 24% less rebuffering, 23% more HD viewers and 25% more 4K viewers. Better quality video, like HD and 4K, requires higher and more consistent throughput to end-users, which is an area where Akamai excels. Across the world, media companies have come to appreciate that it is very difficult to replicate our ability to deliver online video with broadcast-level quality, scale and security. It's also our belief that Akamai is leading the competition in inventing what's next while improving on what's now. That's always been our heritage. So while today's viewers are consuming live streams over IP, we're anticipating what's coming next: virtual and augmented reality delivered seamlessly anywhere in the world over wired and wireless networks with virtually zero latency. That's the future of the digital media experience, and Akamai is already working hard to enable it. In summary, I'm pleased with our Q1 results and I'm even more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as enormous volumes of video move online, billions of devices get connected, cyber attacks explode in size and sophistication, and enterprise networks undergo a massive change as they turn inside out. I believe that Akamai is uniquely positioned to solve the challenge faced by companies across the world as they try to cope with these major technology shifts. Personally, I'm as excited as ever to be at Akamai. I remain confident in Akamai's future, and even though I'm already a large holder of Akamai shares, I'm happy to announce today that I'll be continuing my personal stock buyback program through a 10b5-1 plan that will purchase $1 million of Akamai stock every month for the rest of 2017. Now let me turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed look at the quarter and then we'll answer your questions. Jim? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom highlighted, Q1 was another solid quarter for Akamai with both revenue and earnings coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Revenue in the first quarter was $609 million, up 7% year-over-year or up 8% in constant currency, and up 13% if you exclude our six large Internet platform customers. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was particularly strong, coming in at $369 million, growing 18% year-over-year and was the driver of delivering to the high end of our guidance in the quarter. Performance and Security Solutions contributed over 60% of our total revenue in Q1. We are very pleased with the continued revenue diversification into our highly differentiated, higher margin and more stable subscription model offerings. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across all major product lines with particularly strong growth continuing in our Cloud Security Solutions. First quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $110 million, up 37% year-over-year. Our Security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of $450 million. We are pleased with the continued strong growth and execution of our Cloud Security business, led by our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic offerings and our continued portfolio expansion into new areas, like bot management and Enterprise Application Access. And we plan to further broaden our performance, security and enterprise offerings where we see substantial long-term growth potential. And our recent SOASTA acquisition, which closed in early April, is a good example of extending our market-leading Web acceleration offerings into the natural adjacency of Digital Performance Management focusing on cloud application monitoring and testing and aligning performance to business value. Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $187 million in the quarter, down 9% year-over-year and up 3%, excluding our large Internet platform customers. This revenue growth rate was lower than the past several quarters and below our expectations, driven by a moderation of traffic growth throughout the quarter in our Americas region and within our gaming vertical, most notably. It is important to note that while the pricing environment in the Media business remains highly competitive, aggregate price per bit declines remain roughly within historical norms. As we've discussed in the past, the drivers of the Media business, namely traffic volumes and price, can lead to revenue variability from period to period given the timing of customer renewals at lower price points; the size, timing and delivery mechanism of software and gaming releases; as well as the adoption of social media and video platform capabilities. And while Media growth rates have moderated more than we expected in the near term, we continue to remain bullish on the longer-term secular growth trends for our Media business, particularly in the OTT area, as more video content moves online. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $53 million in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year. Turning now to our Q1 revenue results by customer division, revenue from our Web Division customers was $305 million, up 15% year-over-year. We continued to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with Cloud Security offerings. Revenue from our Media Division customers was $285 million in the quarter, up 1% year-over-year and up 11%, excluding the impact of the large Internet platform customers. This growth rate was lower than 2016 levels driven by the moderation in media traffic that I mentioned earlier. Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $19 million in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year. Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 33% of total revenue in Q1, up two points from Q4 levels. International market revenue was $203 million in the first quarter, up 19% year-over-year or up 21% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia Pacific region. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a year-over-year basis and $2 million on a sequential basis. Revenue from our U.S. market was $407 million, up 2% year-over-year. The large Internet platform customers who are based in the U.S. continued to weigh heavily on the U.S. market growth rates. Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q4 levels and the same period last year. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 66%, down 1 point from Q4 levels and consistent with the same period last year. GAAP operating expenses were $288 million in the quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $228 million, down seasonally from Q4 levels, but above our guidance range, driven by higher commissions and performance incentives as well as increased recruiting-related spend associated with an uptick in hiring activity. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $241 million, down $6 million from Q4 levels, due to seasonal revenue declines, and up $7 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 39%, down one point from Q4 levels and down two points from Q1 last year and within our guidance range. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $87 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $75 million, up slightly from Q4 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $165 million, down $9 million from Q4 levels from the seasonal revenue declines and up $1 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, down one point from Q4 levels and down two points from the same period last year and within our guidance range. Moving on to other income and expense items, interest income for the first quarter was $5 million, up slightly from Q4 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the first quarter was $81 million or $0.46 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $120 million or $0.69 of earnings per diluted share and at the high end of our guidance, driven by the strong revenue achievement. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $34 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 175 million shares, unchanged from Q4 levels and down 2 million shares from Q1 of last year. Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 58 days, up four days from Q4 levels and down two days from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $94 million and at the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow generation continued to be solid with cash from operations of $143 million in the first quarter. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is just under $900 million. During the quarter, we spent $72 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.1 million shares. As we discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us with the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times, including the repurchase program. Over the past five years, we have lowered the company's share count by over 7 million shares or 4% while also spending nearly $1 billion in strategic acquisitions, thereby deploying capital in areas that we believe are in the best long-term interests of the company and our shareholders. In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q1 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company. Before we look ahead to Q2, I wanted to spend just a minute on our recent Investor Summit. For those of you that joined us in person or via the webcast, the themes we shared this year were the same as in prior years. There has been a level of consistency in what we've talked about every year, the favorable market trends, the uniqueness in differentiation of the Akamai platform, the leadership position we maintain and the very rapidly changing and evolving cloud ecosystem and a tremendous amount of innovation we've seen across the business and new product adjacencies as well as continued enhancements within our existing core offerings. Innovation is alive and well across all the divisions, and we believe it will be a key enabler for accelerating growth back to double-digits for the company. The fundamentals of our business remain strong. We're continuing to innovate rapidly. And while our investments in new adjacencies will pressure margins in the near term, we believe they will drive significant future top-line and bottom-line growth. As I said at the Investor Summit, we are committed to balancing both top-line and bottom-line over the long term. And I certainly believe that if we continue to execute, we will remain a compelling investment proposition for investors. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect Media growth rates to continue to moderate from Q1 levels and within Americas gaming vertical, most notably. While it is also possible that Media growth rates moderate in the back half of 2017 as well, we remain bullish in the medium- to long-term growth prospects for this business, especially the potential for an increase in the amount of video traffic that could move online. Factoring in the anticipated moderation of Media growth, we are expecting overall Q2 revenue in the range of $597 million to $609 million. At the high end of this range, year-over-year growth would be 8% in constant currency, consistent with Q1 levels and up 2 points from Q2 2016 levels. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on revenue of $6 million compared to Q2 of last year and a positive impact of $3 million sequentially. At these revenue ranges, we expect GAAP gross margins of 65% and cash gross margins of 76%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $235 million to $241 million, up roughly $10 million sequentially at the midpoint. This increase is driven partly by our continued investment in new product innovation, service delivery enablement and platform scaling and partly from absorbing our recent SOASTA acquisition. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate EBITDA margins of roughly 37%. And while we are not providing specific guidance beyond Q2 during this call, we want to be transparent about our plans to continue to make investments in the business throughout 2017 in the areas outlined earlier even while the Media business experiences a near-term moderation in revenue growth. We believe these are important investments that will enable us to drive accelerated, sustainable, long-term double-digit top and bottom line growth. We are confident we can manage the company within our 37% to 39% EBITDA model, while we may go through some quarters where EBITDA margins fall slightly below these levels, possibly even in the second half of 2017. As I've said in the past, our ability to maintain EBITDA margins within our stated ranges is heavily dependent on revenue volumes, possible M&A and needed investments in the business. Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $77 million to $79 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 24% for Q2. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.61. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $42 million to $44 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 174 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend $110 million to $115 million, excluding equity compensation in the second quarter. This is an uptick from Q1 levels, primarily due to some planned facility and IT upgrades as well as continued expansion of our Secure Delivery Network and Prolexic scrubbing capacity. In summary, I am very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Akamai and our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. Thank you, and Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you, sir. Our first question is from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I think the first question that really jumps to mind is the Investor Summit wasn't that long ago and it really feels like there's a change in tone around the Media business. When did that become apparent? Was it apparent earlier in the quarter and you just wanted to focus on the high level of the investment summit (sic) [Investor Summit] (28:54) or is this something that you were expecting better volumes at the end of the quarter type of thing? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah, let me start with, we are very bullish on the Media business. So that has not changed. Nothing has changed about what we believe are the growth prospects for the Media business. Relative to our Investor Summit is that what we did see is that we did see traffic growth moderate, as I mentioned in the Americas region in particular and very notably in our gaming vertical and it moderated throughout the quarter. So it was relatively strong in January and then it moderated in February and then it moderated further in March. And that was really the driver of kind of, I would say, missing our internal expectations. But I'd say we are very, very optimistic about the Media business long-term. And as we said to you guys before, the nature of the Media business is it does go through periods where traffic spikes, traffic softens at times. But over the long-term, we think this is a very good business and it will be a very good grower for the company. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC And then maybe one follow-up question. Can you help us parse maybe the data this way? You give us the geographic and we see the North America weakness in the comments that you made. But if you were to split the platform, the big six out from that, what did North American growth look like, just so we can kind of go to the non-big six in North America to understand what's happening there. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. Well, you got to be careful because the Americas also includes our Media customers as well as our Web customers. I think Americas' growth, if you exclude the large Internet platform customers, was roughly 10%. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from James Breen of William Blair. Your line is open. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC Thanks. Just a couple questions. One, the guidance for next quarter. As you look at that number, approximately SOASTA closed in the beginning of the quarter and I think you had said to be about $20 million of revenues. Is that included in that guidance number just comparing that relative to where consensus is? And then on the big six, you obviously saw pretty good absolute step down in the first quarter from the fourth quarter and the third quarter last year. Is there anything in there that's seasonal in that? And then as you see think about your largest customers now, how big are your top two or three customers as a percentage of revenue? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. So I think the large Internet platform customers for the most part came in line with what we expected in Q1. They do seasonally drop Q4 to Q1. That Q4 seasonally is a large quarter for all – actually, all of our large media customers in particular. So the step down there was not unexpected, pretty much in line with what we thought. Those customers now represent about 8% of our revenues. So the good news is that as we go through this, the diversification of the company's revenue, as I mentioned in the Investor Summit, we are much better diversified from a customer perspective; we're much better diversified from a product category perspective; and we're much better diversified from a geography perspective. So I think the health and diversification of the company's revenue is much better now than it has been. And I think relative to the giants and maybe what we expect them to do kind of longer-term, I think as we've said before, we do expect a further deceleration with two of those six. And we expect them to further kind of decline as they serve more of their traffic themselves. So nothing there has really changed and what we've seen here is very much in line with our expectations. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC And then just on the guidance side, so that guidance will include some portion of the SOASTA revenue since the deal closed in April? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. Yeah. As I said, we're not going to guide specifically on SOASTA's revenues and margins. I said at the Investor Summit that SOASTA probably will generate, call it, roughly $20 million for the remainder of 2017. It could be a little bit less than that. But what you're going to have in the first quarter with SOASTA is, as you know, with purchase accounting, we're going to take a very large deferred revenue haircut. So the revenue in the second quarter will certainly be less than and it will be in the third and the fourth quarter. So it's not that material. We're going to embed that in our Web performance business and we're going to report that within our Performance and Security category. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC And just, finally, just as you look across the division, it seems as though performance and security continue to perform well. So really the weakness we're seeing is mainly in the media side. Around that gaming vertical, is it multiple players? Is it one or two players that you're seeing having the most pressure? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. There's a lot of competition in media and I would say especially when it comes to software downloads, which is where the revenue comes from the gaming vertical. And as the traffic shifts more towards updates that can be done in the background as opposed to a new game where you're sitting there waiting for it in real time, well, that means performance matters less, means pricing is lower, and competition is even stiffer. And we've talked about that before. And I think that's part of what we're seeing here. But there's lots of competition in media, particularly for software downloads and especially if it's in a background kind of mode. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. And, Jim, your comment about Performance and Security, it continues to be a very strong growth for the company. The 18% growth in Q1, last year it consistently grew kind of in the high-teens. So what you see here really is just a little softening in media growth kind of in our Americas region and in the area that we mentioned. Again, this tends to be the nature of the Media business. And I think we've gone through these spells before where media surges and you start to see media accelerate. So it's not uncommon to go through these periods. But I believe we're optimistic about the long-term growth potential, not just for OTT, but also within gaming. That as gaming becomes more and more latency sensitive and performance sensitive, as you see more and more things like AR and VR that, I think, that all of a sudden, the differentiation for Akamai becomes more and more apparent. So we're bullish about the prospects for media. I think we're going to go through some near-term slowing in media, but optimistic about the long-term for media. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC Terrific. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Will Power of Baird. Your line is open. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. We'll move to the next question, please. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Great, guys. Could you give us maybe some color on your Media business percentage where you think you have kind of fairly differentiated services that are not as commodity like we're seeing on software here? And Jim, maybe just give maybe a little more clarity what you're seeing on the guidance on the Media side, how much it'd be down sequentially? Maybe I kind of missed that. But it seems like I'm having a tough time getting to that type of overall revenue guidance that you're providing for the second quarter. Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I'm not sure what else to tell you about the guidance. We don't guide necessarily by product category that our media products were about 3% growth kind of excluding the large Internet platform customers. And our Media Division customer growth was about 10%. So we expect that to further moderate to the areas that I mentioned, which is in the Americas and notably within gaming. We do expect to have continued strong growth in Performance and Security, continue to expect to have good growth within Services. So I think what you're going to see here in the guide is you kind to do it at the midpoint. At the midpoint, you're going to see a further moderation of media growth rates and that's really kind of what it's all about. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. And on Media, can you maybe give us some color on what do you think is more commoditized versus where you have more for a differentiated product? I mean, I think some of your OTT video was fairly unique in terms of quality and scale. Where you're at, at this point, in the business? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. No, I think you characterized it well. At one end of the spectrum, you've got background software downloads, which is not performance sensitive, and that's the best opportunity for competition. Obviously, pricing lower there as well. The other end of the spectrum, you've got live and linear OTT where performance is very sensitive, and it's very challenging to deliver high quality at scale. And you see the great work that we're doing there with the kinds of awards we win at NAB. We're the go-to player for the major events that you watch online and traffic growing well there. And I think really key for us is to see OTT adoption continue, even better if it accelerates, quality levels to improve as broadcasters move more content into the higher-quality formats, HD and someday, 4K. Those are all very good areas for Akamai. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Siti Panigrahi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi. Just switching to Security business. Security this time grew around 35.5% year-over-year. That's a deceleration from last year of 47% and even Q4 of 41%. I'm wondering, for the remaining of the year, I know you don't guide, but are you expecting any kind of new product that's coming in contributing, because if I look at your 2015 to 2016, it decelerated from 49% to 44%. But as you look 2017, what's your expectation in terms of trends and contribution from the newer products? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. Well, let me start and then I can have – Tom can talk a little about the products. I think you're right that the growth rates in Security were in the kind of the high-40%s and then the low-40%s and now they're in the high 30%s. This is a business that is now a annualized run rate of $450 million. Five years ago this was just a idea. So this business is growing very, very rapidly. Its growth rate on a percentage basis is lower because it's on a much, much bigger base. So we're very, very positive about the Security business and our execution in the Security business. And you've got to remember, this is all subscription model offerings. This is not license model. This is literally a subscription model business that now is approaching $0.5 billion. So Tom can talk a little bit about the product categories, but there's a lot going on there. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. I talked about in the prepared remarks that we have the new version of Kona out now, and that includes now protection for API end points. And the way to think about that is for your mobile apps where as you have more mobile apps deployed, the attackers are now going after those and we have a really unique capability to very nicely defend against those. You have the new version of Bot Manager, and that manages the response given to the automated entities that are coming to your websites and apps. There's a wide variety of those. I guess, price scrapers and account takeover attacks being maybe the worst there. And as I talked about with our new machine learning capabilities to be deployed this summer and then the next version of Bot Manager, we're very excited about that because that'll provide even better capabilities to stop the people trying – checking stolen IDs, and there's a ton of stolen IDs out there today. Then on the enterprise side, we're really just getting started in the market. There's two security products there. We're in the market selling Enterprise Application Access today. That was released in Q4. And we're in beta now with Enterprise Threat Protector, and that will become more generally available this summer. So there's a lot of new activity and products and innovation on the security side of the house and I'm very optimistic for continued very strong growth rates in our Security business. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks for the color. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on that last question regarding the Security business. I'm just curious, do you feel that your security products in aggregate are growing at market rates or potentially above? And to that point, what's the ability to sustain that? It looks like – well, it shouldn't look like. When I look at the new product that are coming out, I'm just curious, are those – in the security segment – are those anticipated to sustain the glide path, if you will, in terms of deceleration in growth that we're seeing? Or is there risk of a more prominent step down? And I guess, the reason I'm asking this is that with the Media business being weak or weaker than anticipated, obviously, the Security business has really been what's supported that. And it's difficult I think for all of us to really explicitly quantify exactly what that growth deceleration is going to look like. I think any color that could help us in that regard would be helpful. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. Let me start with that. It depends on who you want to compare to, but I think for most all choices our growth rate in our security solutions is very strong compared to the competition. The traditional competition there is we have box providers and that just doesn't cut it anymore when you have the scale of attacks being so large that you can easily overwhelm the data center defenses. In fact, you can't afford to buy enough boxes to defend yourself against the large-scale attacks. In addition, we're now, as we talked about, just getting into the area of enterprise security. And just so I'm clear about that, almost all of our revenue today comes from what I would call web security or application security, and that's defending websites and defending web apps against things like DDoS attacks or site takeover attacks, that kind of thing. With our new enterprise line, we're now going to be defending enterprise users and the enterprise network against attacks like phishing attacks, malware attacks, attacks where maybe some device has been infected in the enterprise. The bad guys have gathered up all the internal data and now they're going to exfiltrate it. And we're going to be stopping those kinds of attacks. So really it sounds like security still and it is, but it's by our different capabilities and in the long run, a much larger market for us. So I do think that we have every opportunity to maintain a very strong growth rate in our Security business as it gets larger. We don't provide forward-looking guidance. We will keep you advised on how the new enterprise line is doing once it gets some critical mass. But I'm very optimistic about the future, very strong growth of our security products. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC I guess, maybe just one other question. You made three acquisitions in the second half of 2017: Concord, Cyberfend, and Soha. I think you mentioned that ex FX and ex the top six customers, growth was 13% year-over-year. Can you give us like what's the organic growth? Is it fair to assume maybe 1% or 2% of that was a result of those acquisitions? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No, because Concord was just a handful of people with technology we really like, a very small acquisition. Cyberfend has not yet been integrated. As I talked about, we'll be releasing capabilities with the next version of Bot Manager this summer with Cyberfend technology. And Soha, we're just getting started their (46:23) sales. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Colby, there was really no revenue for any of those. Those were more technology tuck-ins. There's certainly some revenue that comes with SOASTA, as I mentioned, but the first three that you mentioned really were more of technology capability acquisitions. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thanks. Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, hi, Tom, Jim. I have a question on your overseas business and also back here in the States. The strength you're seeing overseas is a bit counterintuitive. I mean several equipment suppliers we track have noted weak demand trends especially in Europe. So is emerging markets primarily driving the strength you're seeing overseas? And then back here in the States, any of your big media customers kind of indicating to you they've increased their OTT programming volumes through the Akamai network heading into the back half or into next year? Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. No, you're absolutely right about the international growth, that the growth rates are very different in the European markets than the Asia Pacific markets. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're seeing very, very strong growth in the Asia Pacific markets. We are not seeing nearly the same level of growth in the European markets, but we have pretty good growth rates also in Europe. They're not the same as in Asia Pacific, but I'd say international growth rates at 21%, heavily fueled by Asia Pacific with decent growth in EMEA. And that's probably not uncommon. We certainly have more opportunity in our Asia Pacific markets where we're not nearly penetrated. And you could take the OTT question. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. I think when you talk to the leading executives, I think they are more bought in than ever that a lot of the video content is going to move over the top. And I think the approach they're taking now is to try lots of different vehicles. A typical broadcaster might have their own OTT offer for their content and they might participate in several aggregated packages. And I think at this point, they don't really know which ones will be the most successful. So I think they're trying a variety of alternatives with the idea being that one way or another, a lot of the content is going to move online. And they don't want to get caught short making the wrong bet, so they're trying lots of the alternatives. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Perfect. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Kelleher of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Want to get back to the media side. Is there a steady-state level of revenue for Internet platform customers? Or does that go right to zero? Does that $51 million level out somewhere? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. I mean, I think at the end of the day, it's tough to tell what's going to happen with the Internet platform customers that we certainly know that two of them have an intention to serve more of the traffic themselves. So as we said over the last couple quarters, we expect those two customers to continue to serve more traffic themselves which means less traffic will be served by Akamai. I think it's more difficult to call some of the other large Internet platform companies. Many of them have a culture of wanting to do more themselves. They do a lot with us today. I think it's really a matter of the use case and the capabilities that we possess. And if the capabilities we possess match the use case that they have and they don't have that capability, then we will continue to grow with them. So the reason we ring-fence them for you is because I think that investors have their own views of what's going to happen with those large companies. And I think it's difficult to call. I think that what we've tried to kind of provide some guidance on for you is that our expectation is they will continue to decline kind of over time here. So I don't know if they're going to go to zero, but I'm not sure we're ready to call that yet. But we expect that they're certainly going to continue to go down. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. And as a follow-up to that, if your other media customers are a little – the gaming sector are little slower, where do you stand with capacity utilization? And can you pull back on CapEx because you've got less media revenue to support? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. To be clear, media traffic is growing at a substantial rate. So we are continuing to build out. And of course, OTT traffic is growing at a substantial rate. So it's not a situation of underutilization. It's just that the growth rates, as a percentage, are less than they were before, of course, led by the largest platform companies. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. So you're not adjusting your CapEx for short-term weakness? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No, I think we always plan our CapEx in alignment with where we believe traffic growth is going to be. And I think, as Tom said, traffic is still growing very rapidly; it's just not growing as rapid a pace as we had projected. So, yes, we will dial CapEx in alignment with our revised projections, but we need to continue to build out as traffic grows and we don't have CapEx just for our Media business that while our Media business is certainly the most CapEx intensive that we do build our CapEx, as I mentioned, with our rapidly growing Security business, we're building out more attack capacity for Prolexic. And so there is a level of investment that's going on in CapEx. Even though security is not heavily CapEx-oriented business, it does have some CapEx. The other thing is, as we continue to make investments in R&D, we're going to capitalize more R&D, which is basically new product incubation. So there's a bunch of areas of CapEx many of which will continue to grow. Our expectation is that we'll manage CapEx and align it with traffic and revenue projections. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. All right. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is open. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey, guys. Good evening. I have two questions. So first is on a comment about EBITDA margins possibly dipping down in the second half below 37%. Is that just a function of lower topline? Or is it higher expenses? And then the second question is, given the what sounds like a worse at least medium-term market on the gaming side, do you feel like you're still in a position to get Media back to double-digits and the company back to double-digit overall by 2018? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I'll take those and then Tom may, if he has anything else to offer. So we're not guiding necessarily, Michael, for the back half. I did signal that because I think you know that EBITDA is a function of a lot of things, revenue and volumes being the most notable. And as I mentioned that there are important investments that we believe we need to make that are in the best interest of the company and our shareholders long-term, which are investments in some of the enterprise areas, some of the security areas, some of the areas that we mentioned that are going to be very significant we believe top line and bottom line growers. And so we don't want to curtail investment there. And so my caution for the back half was more that we're going to continue to make investments, and should you continue to see a top line moderation in Media, and again we don't know whether that's going to be the case. I think we're really talking about Media in particular. I was just being cautious that if we do dip below 37%, I wanted to make sure that people realize our intention is to manage the company to 37% to 39% EBITDA. There may be a quarter or two where you go through something lower than that, but we'll manage it back accordingly. And I forgot what your second question was? Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Double-digit growth? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. So we certainly have the expectation that we're going to return to double-digit growth in 2018. That's still where we believe we can be. You're right with the moderation in media that I don't believe this moderation in media is going to be a long-term phenomenon. So we may be going through a spell here for the next couple quarters where media growth softens. But, as you know, we've been through these periods before and then media growth roars again. So I think there's enough opportunity in media that we can get media growing again and get the company back to double digits. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks, guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Hart of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. There have been a bunch of questions about the Media Division, but I'd like to throw in just one more. This quarter we saw the media customer revenue growth outperform the Media Delivery product growth for orders of that trend (55:46). And wondering does that mean that your customers are buying Performance and Security offerings more than buying traditional Media Delivery offerings. And if that is the case, can you provide some more color on what solutions those customers are purchasing Performance and Security products for? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I would say that the media customers are certainly buying Performance products, especially Security. But they would not be buying more of that than the media products. The large majority of the Media Division revenue comes from our media products. And the large majority of the revenue is from those that have the most media to deliver. The largest several hundred customers would comprise a lot of the revenue. And those folks are big names. And so they really care about their brand. They are big targets for attack, and they care a lot about our security solutions. And so that is why you see the Media Division or the customer revenue for our media customers be growing at a higher rate than the media products per se. Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Thank you. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the question. If we take a step back, what would we have to see in terms of the growth rates that you're seeing in the business that would cause you guys to maybe dial back on the investments? Is there a certain level of growth that you want to sustain? Or what would you have to see to cause you guys to potentially pare back on the incremental investments on the Enterprise and Security side? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I mean, I would say that we manage the company as a portfolio and we look at all the investments that we want to make in product areas and what we believe kind of the return on investment is going to be for each one of them. And as Tom said in his prepared remarks, that our Performance, Security, and Enterprise offerings, have 50% EBITDAs even with the investments that we've been making. And so the Media business goes through spells like this, and what ends up happening is when the Media business goes through a softening, it does pressure near-term margins for the company. I can remind you of a couple years ago when the Media business was growing significantly. You see margin expansion happen very, very rapidly. That's a bit of the nature of the Media business. And so it wouldn't be wise for us to curtail investments in the business because of some short-term disruption in Media growth rates. I don't think that would be in the best interest of our shareholders or the company. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yeah. No, we certainly saw that in 2014 when the Media business was growing north of 20%. So definitely your point's well taken there. If I can just sneak one more on the Media business. If we could get more explicit on the sources of competition, to what extent are you seeing incremental competition from the public cloud providers, AWS, and that cohort versus your (59:11) competitors and then maybe potentially more of the private guys, more of the private Silicon Valley startups? Is there any one group that's being more aggressive than the other? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No. I think when it comes to that Media business, it's aggressive across the board with the entities that you just talked about. And it's been that way for a long, long time. In fact, one group you didn't mention that you would have three to five years ago is the carrier. The carriers were aggressively competing with us three to five years ago or in the past and now they're mostly standardized on Akamai's capabilities. But I think we'll continue to see competition from startups, from the traditional players, and from the cloud providers. And we fare well against the competition, especially in situations where quality matters. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Understood. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yeah, hi. Thank you for the question. I actually had two of them. One was related to OTT. And I was just wondering what's the potential for the players that are trying to get big in OTT to generate the same problem down the road that you're having with the big platform providers today where the biggest companies who get all the subs end up investing to do this themselves. Like, what are you hearing from them? Is there anything you could share with us to help maybe mitigate those fears since OTT is one of your drivers that you're holding out? And then the second thing was just your comments about the carriers. In particular, can you share with us with the transition to these unlimited data plans and people forcing if you use those to go from HD to SD quality and obviously, the size of those files then becomes smaller. How do we think about that having any positive or neutral or negative impact on the growth that you're seeing through the network? Thank you. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Okay. The first question on are we worried about the big broadcasters as they start their own services and grow and so forth, doing more themselves? I don't think so. I think it's going in the other direction. Generally speaking, those folks are taking, doing less in-house maybe than they did before. I think they've recognized this is not their core area of expertise and doing more outsourcing going forward. So I don't see that's an issue. Obviously, these giant platform companies, most of those guys spend billions of dollars a year in infrastructure. And they're just at a different scale where it becomes possible for them to think about spending hundreds of millions more, trying to do some content delivery. So I don't see that being an issue in terms of OTT going forward. If anything, it's going in the other direction. With the carriers, I think we're seeing actually the quality levels for video increase as opposed to a scenario you're describing where it would decrease. And there's competition there and their users, the end viewers, demand the higher-quality video as you get better devices into the home, I think just the opposite happens. You get higher quality levels and we see the carriers already experimenting with sort of super-high quality, which means more traffic. So that, I think, it's more likely to go that way then to lower quality levels. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of them from me. First on the gaming side, it seems to me the shift to background updates has been happening gradually. Was there a specific event or a specific customer that drove what seems to be a bit more – it feels like the messaging is that this was a bit more sudden than I would perceive sort of the gradual shift to play out as. Any color there? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. I don't think there's any specific customer. And like you say, this shift has been taking place. And it's having an impact on traffic growth. So it's not one event, no. I think it's been a trend in the industry. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Okay. And then with respect to the Ions or the acceleration side, have you seen on renewals pricing – how would you describe pricing on renewals around Ion and acceleration pricing trends now, say, versus 12 months, 18 months ago? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. I think when you come to a renewal for the same product, they always want to lower price. On the other hand, maybe there's more traffic, which helps. And the best part is we've got a lot of new products. There's Image Manager, there's Bot Manager, there's the next generation of Ion focused on mobile, the next generation of Kona, again, focused on mobile. So there's more to bring to bear in the account, which helps us hold price or grow revenue in the base. And so we are seeing revenue growth in the base of customers with our Performance and Security products. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC And how about the actual net customer count growth? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. We don't actually report customer count. We have done that for some time. So really not much to comment there. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Okay. And then, I guess, just one last one. Just a clarification. You commented on expenses being a bit above the expectations on the back of higher commissions and more aggressive hiring. Both seem a bit counterintuitive given the business trends. Can you just expand a bit on those? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Well, actually, we performed well in Q1. So it shouldn't be surprising that commissions then would be a little bit higher. And relative to my comment about getting recruiting related spend that as I mentioned, last year was a period where hiring was a pretty low period for the company. And our expectation is we're going to step up hiring a bit more this year and so we incurred more kind of recruiting-related spend in the first quarter than we expected, which means we moved a little bit faster than we thought we could. So those are really the two big drivers. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Thank you, Jeff. So, I think, operator we have time for one more. I know we are running little bit long. So want to be cognizant of that. So maybe we will take one more question. Operator Yes, sir. Our last question is from Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, one more on the Media Solutions category. Can you give us the split between gaming, video, social and software downloads? And then what are your expectations for some of the new services coming out? I mean, Hulu, potentially Comcast products, potentially Verizon product. For those companies that already have a CDN capability, would you expect that traffic to continue to go to you guys or would they have that traffic on their own platform or it might be a hybrid of both? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Okay. So I'll take those. A lot of the business is video and a lot of it is software downloads. Now gaming, most of the gaming business today is software downloads, just in the gaming vertical. We don't give out the splits, but both are significant sources of traffic and revenue for us. On your comment around Hulu, Comcast and Verizon, the answer is it depends. With Comcast, they have their own delivery mechanism for their own networks. So to get to their own subscribers, they may use their own delivery network. We also have many Akamai Edge servers within the Comcast networks. So we deliver a lot of content to Comcast users as well. Same with Verizon. Verizon has a competing offer, but we deliver a lot of content within Verizon's network. You take a Hulu, that's more of a direct aggregator of content and that's a situation where Akamai would be in a good position to deliver their content. And even in cases where there's a big content provider that maybe is in the same parent company with a big network, even if they have their own capability to deliver in their network, you might well see us doing the delivery of the content for that content provider. Generally speaking, there's a couple of exceptions. But generally speaking, a lot of the video delivery that's done, especially live or for-pay content, we'll be doing that today. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at a number of investor events in May and June in both the Americas and in EMEA and details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.

Our first question is from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I think the first question that really jumps to mind is the Investor Summit wasn't that long ago and it really feels like there's a change in tone around the Media business. When did that become apparent? Was it apparent earlier in the quarter and you just wanted to focus on the high level of the investment summit (sic) [Investor Summit] (28:54) or is this something that you were expecting better volumes at the end of the quarter type of thing? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah, let me start with, we are very bullish on the Media business. So that has not changed. Nothing has changed about what we believe are the growth prospects for the Media business. Relative to our Investor Summit is that what we did see is that we did see traffic growth moderate, as I mentioned in the Americas region in particular and very notably in our gaming vertical and it moderated throughout the quarter. So it was relatively strong in January and then it moderated in February and then it moderated further in March. And that was really the driver of kind of, I would say, missing our internal expectations. But I'd say we are very, very optimistic about the Media business long-term. And as we said to you guys before, the nature of the Media business is it does go through periods where traffic spikes, traffic softens at times. But over the long-term, we think this is a very good business and it will be a very good grower for the company. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC And then maybe one follow-up question. Can you help us parse maybe the data this way? You give us the geographic and we see the North America weakness in the comments that you made. But if you were to split the platform, the big six out from that, what did North American growth look like, just so we can kind of go to the non-big six in North America to understand what's happening there. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. Well, you got to be careful because the Americas also includes our Media customers as well as our Web customers. I think Americas' growth, if you exclude the large Internet platform customers, was roughly 10%. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from James Breen of William Blair. Your line is open. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC Thanks. Just a couple questions. One, the guidance for next quarter. As you look at that number, approximately SOASTA closed in the beginning of the quarter and I think you had said to be about $20 million of revenues. Is that included in that guidance number just comparing that relative to where consensus is? And then on the big six, you obviously saw pretty good absolute step down in the first quarter from the fourth quarter and the third quarter last year. Is there anything in there that's seasonal in that? And then as you see think about your largest customers now, how big are your top two or three customers as a percentage of revenue? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. So I think the large Internet platform customers for the most part came in line with what we expected in Q1. They do seasonally drop Q4 to Q1. That Q4 seasonally is a large quarter for all – actually, all of our large media customers in particular. So the step down there was not unexpected, pretty much in line with what we thought. Those customers now represent about 8% of our revenues. So the good news is that as we go through this, the diversification of the company's revenue, as I mentioned in the Investor Summit, we are much better diversified from a customer perspective; we're much better diversified from a product category perspective; and we're much better diversified from a geography perspective. So I think the health and diversification of the company's revenue is much better now than it has been. And I think relative to the giants and maybe what we expect them to do kind of longer-term, I think as we've said before, we do expect a further deceleration with two of those six. And we expect them to further kind of decline as they serve more of their traffic themselves. So nothing there has really changed and what we've seen here is very much in line with our expectations. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC And then just on the guidance side, so that guidance will include some portion of the SOASTA revenue since the deal closed in April? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. Yeah. As I said, we're not going to guide specifically on SOASTA's revenues and margins. I said at the Investor Summit that SOASTA probably will generate, call it, roughly $20 million for the remainder of 2017. It could be a little bit less than that. But what you're going to have in the first quarter with SOASTA is, as you know, with purchase accounting, we're going to take a very large deferred revenue haircut. So the revenue in the second quarter will certainly be less than and it will be in the third and the fourth quarter. So it's not that material. We're going to embed that in our Web performance business and we're going to report that within our Performance and Security category. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC And just, finally, just as you look across the division, it seems as though performance and security continue to perform well. So really the weakness we're seeing is mainly in the media side. Around that gaming vertical, is it multiple players? Is it one or two players that you're seeing having the most pressure? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. There's a lot of competition in media and I would say especially when it comes to software downloads, which is where the revenue comes from the gaming vertical. And as the traffic shifts more towards updates that can be done in the background as opposed to a new game where you're sitting there waiting for it in real time, well, that means performance matters less, means pricing is lower, and competition is even stiffer. And we've talked about that before. And I think that's part of what we're seeing here. But there's lots of competition in media, particularly for software downloads and especially if it's in a background kind of mode. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. And, Jim, your comment about Performance and Security, it continues to be a very strong growth for the company. The 18% growth in Q1, last year it consistently grew kind of in the high-teens. So what you see here really is just a little softening in media growth kind of in our Americas region and in the area that we mentioned. Again, this tends to be the nature of the Media business. And I think we've gone through these spells before where media surges and you start to see media accelerate. So it's not uncommon to go through these periods. But I believe we're optimistic about the long-term growth potential, not just for OTT, but also within gaming. That as gaming becomes more and more latency sensitive and performance sensitive, as you see more and more things like AR and VR that, I think, that all of a sudden, the differentiation for Akamai becomes more and more apparent. So we're bullish about the prospects for media. I think we're going to go through some near-term slowing in media, but optimistic about the long-term for media. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC Terrific. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Will Power of Baird. Your line is open. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. We'll move to the next question, please. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Great, guys. Could you give us maybe some color on your Media business percentage where you think you have kind of fairly differentiated services that are not as commodity like we're seeing on software here? And Jim, maybe just give maybe a little more clarity what you're seeing on the guidance on the Media side, how much it'd be down sequentially? Maybe I kind of missed that. But it seems like I'm having a tough time getting to that type of overall revenue guidance that you're providing for the second quarter. Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I'm not sure what else to tell you about the guidance. We don't guide necessarily by product category that our media products were about 3% growth kind of excluding the large Internet platform customers. And our Media Division customer growth was about 10%. So we expect that to further moderate to the areas that I mentioned, which is in the Americas and notably within gaming. We do expect to have continued strong growth in Performance and Security, continue to expect to have good growth within Services. So I think what you're going to see here in the guide is you kind to do it at the midpoint. At the midpoint, you're going to see a further moderation of media growth rates and that's really kind of what it's all about. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. And on Media, can you maybe give us some color on what do you think is more commoditized versus where you have more for a differentiated product? I mean, I think some of your OTT video was fairly unique in terms of quality and scale. Where you're at, at this point, in the business? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. No, I think you characterized it well. At one end of the spectrum, you've got background software downloads, which is not performance sensitive, and that's the best opportunity for competition. Obviously, pricing lower there as well. The other end of the spectrum, you've got live and linear OTT where performance is very sensitive, and it's very challenging to deliver high quality at scale. And you see the great work that we're doing there with the kinds of awards we win at NAB. We're the go-to player for the major events that you watch online and traffic growing well there. And I think really key for us is to see OTT adoption continue, even better if it accelerates, quality levels to improve as broadcasters move more content into the higher-quality formats, HD and someday, 4K. Those are all very good areas for Akamai. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Siti Panigrahi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi. Just switching to Security business. Security this time grew around 35.5% year-over-year. That's a deceleration from last year of 47% and even Q4 of 41%. I'm wondering, for the remaining of the year, I know you don't guide, but are you expecting any kind of new product that's coming in contributing, because if I look at your 2015 to 2016, it decelerated from 49% to 44%. But as you look 2017, what's your expectation in terms of trends and contribution from the newer products? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. Well, let me start and then I can have – Tom can talk a little about the products. I think you're right that the growth rates in Security were in the kind of the high-40%s and then the low-40%s and now they're in the high 30%s. This is a business that is now a annualized run rate of $450 million. Five years ago this was just a idea. So this business is growing very, very rapidly. Its growth rate on a percentage basis is lower because it's on a much, much bigger base. So we're very, very positive about the Security business and our execution in the Security business. And you've got to remember, this is all subscription model offerings. This is not license model. This is literally a subscription model business that now is approaching $0.5 billion. So Tom can talk a little bit about the product categories, but there's a lot going on there. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. I talked about in the prepared remarks that we have the new version of Kona out now, and that includes now protection for API end points. And the way to think about that is for your mobile apps where as you have more mobile apps deployed, the attackers are now going after those and we have a really unique capability to very nicely defend against those. You have the new version of Bot Manager, and that manages the response given to the automated entities that are coming to your websites and apps. There's a wide variety of those. I guess, price scrapers and account takeover attacks being maybe the worst there. And as I talked about with our new machine learning capabilities to be deployed this summer and then the next version of Bot Manager, we're very excited about that because that'll provide even better capabilities to stop the people trying – checking stolen IDs, and there's a ton of stolen IDs out there today. Then on the enterprise side, we're really just getting started in the market. There's two security products there. We're in the market selling Enterprise Application Access today. That was released in Q4. And we're in beta now with Enterprise Threat Protector, and that will become more generally available this summer. So there's a lot of new activity and products and innovation on the security side of the house and I'm very optimistic for continued very strong growth rates in our Security business. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks for the color. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on that last question regarding the Security business. I'm just curious, do you feel that your security products in aggregate are growing at market rates or potentially above? And to that point, what's the ability to sustain that? It looks like – well, it shouldn't look like. When I look at the new product that are coming out, I'm just curious, are those – in the security segment – are those anticipated to sustain the glide path, if you will, in terms of deceleration in growth that we're seeing? Or is there risk of a more prominent step down? And I guess, the reason I'm asking this is that with the Media business being weak or weaker than anticipated, obviously, the Security business has really been what's supported that. And it's difficult I think for all of us to really explicitly quantify exactly what that growth deceleration is going to look like. I think any color that could help us in that regard would be helpful. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. Let me start with that. It depends on who you want to compare to, but I think for most all choices our growth rate in our security solutions is very strong compared to the competition. The traditional competition there is we have box providers and that just doesn't cut it anymore when you have the scale of attacks being so large that you can easily overwhelm the data center defenses. In fact, you can't afford to buy enough boxes to defend yourself against the large-scale attacks. In addition, we're now, as we talked about, just getting into the area of enterprise security. And just so I'm clear about that, almost all of our revenue today comes from what I would call web security or application security, and that's defending websites and defending web apps against things like DDoS attacks or site takeover attacks, that kind of thing. With our new enterprise line, we're now going to be defending enterprise users and the enterprise network against attacks like phishing attacks, malware attacks, attacks where maybe some device has been infected in the enterprise. The bad guys have gathered up all the internal data and now they're going to exfiltrate it. And we're going to be stopping those kinds of attacks. So really it sounds like security still and it is, but it's by our different capabilities and in the long run, a much larger market for us. So I do think that we have every opportunity to maintain a very strong growth rate in our Security business as it gets larger. We don't provide forward-looking guidance. We will keep you advised on how the new enterprise line is doing once it gets some critical mass. But I'm very optimistic about the future, very strong growth of our security products. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC I guess, maybe just one other question. You made three acquisitions in the second half of 2017: Concord, Cyberfend, and Soha. I think you mentioned that ex FX and ex the top six customers, growth was 13% year-over-year. Can you give us like what's the organic growth? Is it fair to assume maybe 1% or 2% of that was a result of those acquisitions? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No, because Concord was just a handful of people with technology we really like, a very small acquisition. Cyberfend has not yet been integrated. As I talked about, we'll be releasing capabilities with the next version of Bot Manager this summer with Cyberfend technology. And Soha, we're just getting started their (46:23) sales. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Colby, there was really no revenue for any of those. Those were more technology tuck-ins. There's certainly some revenue that comes with SOASTA, as I mentioned, but the first three that you mentioned really were more of technology capability acquisitions. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thanks. Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, hi, Tom, Jim. I have a question on your overseas business and also back here in the States. The strength you're seeing overseas is a bit counterintuitive. I mean several equipment suppliers we track have noted weak demand trends especially in Europe. So is emerging markets primarily driving the strength you're seeing overseas? And then back here in the States, any of your big media customers kind of indicating to you they've increased their OTT programming volumes through the Akamai network heading into the back half or into next year? Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. No, you're absolutely right about the international growth, that the growth rates are very different in the European markets than the Asia Pacific markets. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're seeing very, very strong growth in the Asia Pacific markets. We are not seeing nearly the same level of growth in the European markets, but we have pretty good growth rates also in Europe. They're not the same as in Asia Pacific, but I'd say international growth rates at 21%, heavily fueled by Asia Pacific with decent growth in EMEA. And that's probably not uncommon. We certainly have more opportunity in our Asia Pacific markets where we're not nearly penetrated. And you could take the OTT question. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. I think when you talk to the leading executives, I think they are more bought in than ever that a lot of the video content is going to move over the top. And I think the approach they're taking now is to try lots of different vehicles. A typical broadcaster might have their own OTT offer for their content and they might participate in several aggregated packages. And I think at this point, they don't really know which ones will be the most successful. So I think they're trying a variety of alternatives with the idea being that one way or another, a lot of the content is going to move online. And they don't want to get caught short making the wrong bet, so they're trying lots of the alternatives. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Perfect. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Kelleher of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Want to get back to the media side. Is there a steady-state level of revenue for Internet platform customers? Or does that go right to zero? Does that $51 million level out somewhere? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. I mean, I think at the end of the day, it's tough to tell what's going to happen with the Internet platform customers that we certainly know that two of them have an intention to serve more of the traffic themselves. So as we said over the last couple quarters, we expect those two customers to continue to serve more traffic themselves which means less traffic will be served by Akamai. I think it's more difficult to call some of the other large Internet platform companies. Many of them have a culture of wanting to do more themselves. They do a lot with us today. I think it's really a matter of the use case and the capabilities that we possess. And if the capabilities we possess match the use case that they have and they don't have that capability, then we will continue to grow with them. So the reason we ring-fence them for you is because I think that investors have their own views of what's going to happen with those large companies. And I think it's difficult to call. I think that what we've tried to kind of provide some guidance on for you is that our expectation is they will continue to decline kind of over time here. So I don't know if they're going to go to zero, but I'm not sure we're ready to call that yet. But we expect that they're certainly going to continue to go down. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. And as a follow-up to that, if your other media customers are a little – the gaming sector are little slower, where do you stand with capacity utilization? And can you pull back on CapEx because you've got less media revenue to support? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. To be clear, media traffic is growing at a substantial rate. So we are continuing to build out. And of course, OTT traffic is growing at a substantial rate. So it's not a situation of underutilization. It's just that the growth rates, as a percentage, are less than they were before, of course, led by the largest platform companies. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. So you're not adjusting your CapEx for short-term weakness? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No, I think we always plan our CapEx in alignment with where we believe traffic growth is going to be. And I think, as Tom said, traffic is still growing very rapidly; it's just not growing as rapid a pace as we had projected. So, yes, we will dial CapEx in alignment with our revised projections, but we need to continue to build out as traffic grows and we don't have CapEx just for our Media business that while our Media business is certainly the most CapEx intensive that we do build our CapEx, as I mentioned, with our rapidly growing Security business, we're building out more attack capacity for Prolexic. And so there is a level of investment that's going on in CapEx. Even though security is not heavily CapEx-oriented business, it does have some CapEx. The other thing is, as we continue to make investments in R&D, we're going to capitalize more R&D, which is basically new product incubation. So there's a bunch of areas of CapEx many of which will continue to grow. Our expectation is that we'll manage CapEx and align it with traffic and revenue projections. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. All right. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is open. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey, guys. Good evening. I have two questions. So first is on a comment about EBITDA margins possibly dipping down in the second half below 37%. Is that just a function of lower topline? Or is it higher expenses? And then the second question is, given the what sounds like a worse at least medium-term market on the gaming side, do you feel like you're still in a position to get Media back to double-digits and the company back to double-digit overall by 2018? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I'll take those and then Tom may, if he has anything else to offer. So we're not guiding necessarily, Michael, for the back half. I did signal that because I think you know that EBITDA is a function of a lot of things, revenue and volumes being the most notable. And as I mentioned that there are important investments that we believe we need to make that are in the best interest of the company and our shareholders long-term, which are investments in some of the enterprise areas, some of the security areas, some of the areas that we mentioned that are going to be very significant we believe top line and bottom line growers. And so we don't want to curtail investment there. And so my caution for the back half was more that we're going to continue to make investments, and should you continue to see a top line moderation in Media, and again we don't know whether that's going to be the case. I think we're really talking about Media in particular. I was just being cautious that if we do dip below 37%, I wanted to make sure that people realize our intention is to manage the company to 37% to 39% EBITDA. There may be a quarter or two where you go through something lower than that, but we'll manage it back accordingly. And I forgot what your second question was? Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Double-digit growth? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. So we certainly have the expectation that we're going to return to double-digit growth in 2018. That's still where we believe we can be. You're right with the moderation in media that I don't believe this moderation in media is going to be a long-term phenomenon. So we may be going through a spell here for the next couple quarters where media growth softens. But, as you know, we've been through these periods before and then media growth roars again. So I think there's enough opportunity in media that we can get media growing again and get the company back to double digits. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks, guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Hart of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. There have been a bunch of questions about the Media Division, but I'd like to throw in just one more. This quarter we saw the media customer revenue growth outperform the Media Delivery product growth for orders of that trend (55:46). And wondering does that mean that your customers are buying Performance and Security offerings more than buying traditional Media Delivery offerings. And if that is the case, can you provide some more color on what solutions those customers are purchasing Performance and Security products for? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I would say that the media customers are certainly buying Performance products, especially Security. But they would not be buying more of that than the media products. The large majority of the Media Division revenue comes from our media products. And the large majority of the revenue is from those that have the most media to deliver. The largest several hundred customers would comprise a lot of the revenue. And those folks are big names. And so they really care about their brand. They are big targets for attack, and they care a lot about our security solutions. And so that is why you see the Media Division or the customer revenue for our media customers be growing at a higher rate than the media products per se. Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Thank you. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the question. If we take a step back, what would we have to see in terms of the growth rates that you're seeing in the business that would cause you guys to maybe dial back on the investments? Is there a certain level of growth that you want to sustain? Or what would you have to see to cause you guys to potentially pare back on the incremental investments on the Enterprise and Security side? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I mean, I would say that we manage the company as a portfolio and we look at all the investments that we want to make in product areas and what we believe kind of the return on investment is going to be for each one of them. And as Tom said in his prepared remarks, that our Performance, Security, and Enterprise offerings, have 50% EBITDAs even with the investments that we've been making. And so the Media business goes through spells like this, and what ends up happening is when the Media business goes through a softening, it does pressure near-term margins for the company. I can remind you of a couple years ago when the Media business was growing significantly. You see margin expansion happen very, very rapidly. That's a bit of the nature of the Media business. And so it wouldn't be wise for us to curtail investments in the business because of some short-term disruption in Media growth rates. I don't think that would be in the best interest of our shareholders or the company. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yeah. No, we certainly saw that in 2014 when the Media business was growing north of 20%. So definitely your point's well taken there. If I can just sneak one more on the Media business. If we could get more explicit on the sources of competition, to what extent are you seeing incremental competition from the public cloud providers, AWS, and that cohort versus your (59:11) competitors and then maybe potentially more of the private guys, more of the private Silicon Valley startups? Is there any one group that's being more aggressive than the other? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No. I think when it comes to that Media business, it's aggressive across the board with the entities that you just talked about. And it's been that way for a long, long time. In fact, one group you didn't mention that you would have three to five years ago is the carrier. The carriers were aggressively competing with us three to five years ago or in the past and now they're mostly standardized on Akamai's capabilities. But I think we'll continue to see competition from startups, from the traditional players, and from the cloud providers. And we fare well against the competition, especially in situations where quality matters. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Understood. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yeah, hi. Thank you for the question. I actually had two of them. One was related to OTT. And I was just wondering what's the potential for the players that are trying to get big in OTT to generate the same problem down the road that you're having with the big platform providers today where the biggest companies who get all the subs end up investing to do this themselves. Like, what are you hearing from them? Is there anything you could share with us to help maybe mitigate those fears since OTT is one of your drivers that you're holding out? And then the second thing was just your comments about the carriers. In particular, can you share with us with the transition to these unlimited data plans and people forcing if you use those to go from HD to SD quality and obviously, the size of those files then becomes smaller. How do we think about that having any positive or neutral or negative impact on the growth that you're seeing through the network? Thank you. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Okay. The first question on are we worried about the big broadcasters as they start their own services and grow and so forth, doing more themselves? I don't think so. I think it's going in the other direction. Generally speaking, those folks are taking, doing less in-house maybe than they did before. I think they've recognized this is not their core area of expertise and doing more outsourcing going forward. So I don't see that's an issue. Obviously, these giant platform companies, most of those guys spend billions of dollars a year in infrastructure. And they're just at a different scale where it becomes possible for them to think about spending hundreds of millions more, trying to do some content delivery. So I don't see that being an issue in terms of OTT going forward. If anything, it's going in the other direction. With the carriers, I think we're seeing actually the quality levels for video increase as opposed to a scenario you're describing where it would decrease. And there's competition there and their users, the end viewers, demand the higher-quality video as you get better devices into the home, I think just the opposite happens. You get higher quality levels and we see the carriers already experimenting with sort of super-high quality, which means more traffic. So that, I think, it's more likely to go that way then to lower quality levels. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of them from me. First on the gaming side, it seems to me the shift to background updates has been happening gradually. Was there a specific event or a specific customer that drove what seems to be a bit more – it feels like the messaging is that this was a bit more sudden than I would perceive sort of the gradual shift to play out as. Any color there? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. I don't think there's any specific customer. And like you say, this shift has been taking place. And it's having an impact on traffic growth. So it's not one event, no. I think it's been a trend in the industry. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Okay. And then with respect to the Ions or the acceleration side, have you seen on renewals pricing – how would you describe pricing on renewals around Ion and acceleration pricing trends now, say, versus 12 months, 18 months ago? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. I think when you come to a renewal for the same product, they always want to lower price. On the other hand, maybe there's more traffic, which helps. And the best part is we've got a lot of new products. There's Image Manager, there's Bot Manager, there's the next generation of Ion focused on mobile, the next generation of Kona, again, focused on mobile. So there's more to bring to bear in the account, which helps us hold price or grow revenue in the base. And so we are seeing revenue growth in the base of customers with our Performance and Security products. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC And how about the actual net customer count growth? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. We don't actually report customer count. We have done that for some time. So really not much to comment there. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Okay. And then, I guess, just one last one. Just a clarification. You commented on expenses being a bit above the expectations on the back of higher commissions and more aggressive hiring. Both seem a bit counterintuitive given the business trends. Can you just expand a bit on those? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Well, actually, we performed well in Q1. So it shouldn't be surprising that commissions then would be a little bit higher. And relative to my comment about getting recruiting related spend that as I mentioned, last year was a period where hiring was a pretty low period for the company. And our expectation is we're going to step up hiring a bit more this year and so we incurred more kind of recruiting-related spend in the first quarter than we expected, which means we moved a little bit faster than we thought we could. So those are really the two big drivers. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Thank you, Jeff. So, I think, operator we have time for one more. I know we are running little bit long. So want to be cognizant of that. So maybe we will take one more question. Operator Yes, sir. Our last question is from Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, one more on the Media Solutions category. Can you give us the split between gaming, video, social and software downloads? And then what are your expectations for some of the new services coming out? I mean, Hulu, potentially Comcast products, potentially Verizon product. For those companies that already have a CDN capability, would you expect that traffic to continue to go to you guys or would they have that traffic on their own platform or it might be a hybrid of both? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Okay. So I'll take those. A lot of the business is video and a lot of it is software downloads. Now gaming, most of the gaming business today is software downloads, just in the gaming vertical. We don't give out the splits, but both are significant sources of traffic and revenue for us. On your comment around Hulu, Comcast and Verizon, the answer is it depends. With Comcast, they have their own delivery mechanism for their own networks. So to get to their own subscribers, they may use their own delivery network. We also have many Akamai Edge servers within the Comcast networks. So we deliver a lot of content to Comcast users as well. Same with Verizon. Verizon has a competing offer, but we deliver a lot of content within Verizon's network. You take a Hulu, that's more of a direct aggregator of content and that's a situation where Akamai would be in a good position to deliver their content. And even in cases where there's a big content provider that maybe is in the same parent company with a big network, even if they have their own capability to deliver in their network, you might well see us doing the delivery of the content for that content provider. Generally speaking, there's a couple of exceptions. But generally speaking, a lot of the video delivery that's done, especially live or for-pay content, we'll be doing that today. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at a number of investor events in May and June in both the Americas and in EMEA and details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.
