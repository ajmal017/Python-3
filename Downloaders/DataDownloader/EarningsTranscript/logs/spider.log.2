And thank you for all of you for joining us today for our conference call. We are going to review the financial results we released last night and provide a business update before the Q&A session. Our speakers today are Peer Schatz, the Chief Executive Officer of QIAGEN, and Roland Sackers, the Chief Financial Officer. On slide two, you will see the customary Safe Harbor Statement explaining that the discussion and responses to your questions on this call today reflect management’s view as of today, July 30, 2015. We will be making statements and providing responses to your questions that state our intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future. And these are forward-looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provisions. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. QIAGEN disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Also during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. You can find a reconciliation of these figures to GAAP measures in the press release and the presentation for this call. I would like to now hand over to Peer. Peer Schatz Thank you, John. And welcome to all of you. We are moving ahead during 2015 in line with our goals and have these messages to summarize our performance for the second quarter and first half of this year. First, we came in ahead of our targets for the second quarter, in particular adjusted net sales were up 5% at constant exchange rates and ahead of our 4% target, while adjusted EPS was $0.28 also at constant exchange rates and also ahead of the target with $0.26 to $0.27 per share. We maintained the adjusted operating income margin at 25% of sales while making important investments to accelerate innovation and growth at the same time. Adjusted net sales were $319.5 million of actual rates and declined 4% due to the anticipated currency headwind of 9 percentage points while adjusted EPS was $0.26 which was an increase from $0.25 a year ago. Second, we are moving ahead on transforming QIAGEN. As you know our performance over the last two years has been marked by the sharp impact of the decline in revenues of HPV test in the United States that are used for cervical cancer screening against the ongoing solid growth from the rest of the QIAGEN portfolio. We saw the same trend in the second quarter. Sharply lower U.S. sales of HPV tests created 3 percentage points of headwind which was in line with our expectations while the rest of the QIAGEN portfolio grew 8% at constant exchange rates and provided 97% of sales and led to the 5% constant exchange rate overall sales growth. Our customer classes delivered sales gains. Molecular diagnostics benefitted from increasing contributions from the growth drivers. Applied testing generated 11% constant exchange rate growth driven by human identification and forensics while Academia and pharma both grew 7% constant exchange rate on a mix of underlying growth and contributions from the acquisition in late 2014 of the Enzymatics Next-Gen Sequencing consumables portfolio. All regions also delivered gains in the second quarter with the top seven emerging markets standing out with an 11% constant exchange rate growth and 15% of sales despite continued pressures in particular from Russia. Our story is about the transformation of QIAGEN through targeted investments into its premium differentiated portfolio of products and solutions that are designed to address the needs of customers and life sciences and molecular diagnostics. Our solutions allow these customers to gain valuable molecular insights from any sample. Third, we are re-affirming our full year guidance for higher adjusted net sales and earnings per share at constant exchange rates. We have also set goals for 2015 to increase free cash flow which was up 10% in the first half of the year to $84 million and deliver improvements in the adjusted operating income margin. I also wanted to mention the senior leadership change announced with the quarterly release. Brad Crutchfield joined QIAGEN in June as Senior Vice President Head of the Life Sciences business area and a member of the executive committee. He has a great profile to lead our Life Sciences franchise. Brad was most recently Vice President and General Manager for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Illumina and prior to that he was at Bio-Rad and served at Executive Vice President and President of their Life Sciences Group. We’ve made some significant changes to our leadership team over the last 12 to 18 months bringing in a mix of new leaders from outside as well as promoting from within. This team is well suited to address the opportunities we are facing. Moving to slide five. This slides you how QIAGEN has been growing during this challenging transformation. As you know on the one side, we’ve been facing heavy price pressure in the United States for HPV test. And this was due to the entry of new competitors but we have maintained clear leadership albeit at a competition induced dramatically lower price. For 2015, we continue to expect about 3 to 4 percentage points of headwind and this is in line with the first half. For the third quarter we expect three percentage points and about 1 to 2 percentage points in the fourth quarter. This means the sales contribution from products related to HPV screening in the United States for the fourth quarter of 2015 will be well below 3% of our total sales so any future change in the U.S. HPV franchise is not expected to have a major impact on overall QIAGEN sales. So we are nearing the end of this headwind, during late 2015, and then you will see a faster overall growth rate for QIAGEN that is being driven by the solid performance from the rest of our business. I’m now on slide six to discuss the growth drivers. On the QIAsymphony Automation Platform new test submissions are expected later this year and we have a new collaboration we disclosed as well with Seegene. This partnership involves developing panels using the Seegene assay design approach to create assays for infectious disease, panels with a goal to enable simultaneous amplification of upto 20 targets per two. The test will be validated on QIAsymphony RGQ and we will market the assays. Another highlight brings together the automation power of QIAsymphony and our leadership in liquid biopsy sample technologies. These involve taking a body fluid most often blood to gain access to DNA and or RNA. Our presence in this field is very strong as a supplier to almost every participant conducting or evaluating liquid biopsy testing. Our teams have launched a breakthrough protocol to automate the isolation of free circulating DNA from human plasma in a highly automated format which can address their high throughput needs of example given NIPT team as well as the stringent requirements there as well as in the emerging area of cancer testing. Customer feedback has been very positive. On QuantiFERON I want to mention the new Director from OSHA, the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration for TB screening of healthcare workers. This is the first such update on this topic in a long time and it included for the first time a reference to the modern TB test and the only one mentioned was QuantiFERON TB goal as an alternative to the traditional skin test. This is through the validation of our leading position in customer value proposition which is based on offering the most cost effective and clinically validated TB test. We also advanced our personalized healthcare portfolio in particular with the FDA approval of therascreen EGFR kit as a companion diagnostic to guide the use of AstraZeneca's targeted lung cancer therapy IRESSA. This marks the fourth U.S. Regulatory Approval of a QIAGEN companion diagnostic paired with a targeted cancer therapy and this further validates our leadership position in this exciting area. The inflow of new projects in partnership with pharmaceutical companies has never been stronger and spans across all platforms, PCR, NGS and Modaflex. In next-gen sequencing preparations are progressing as planned for its commercialization of the GeneReader benchtop NGS workflow in the second half of 2015 and we are looking forward to have more to share with you later this year. And now on slide seven and would like to share an update on our bioinformatics franchise. On this slide, you see that our offering goes far beyond creating a seamless workflow to transform complex biological data coming out of sequencers into valuable molecular insights. What we are offering is even more and what our customer’s value is a meta knowledge base that ties to get our own solutions with other proprietary and public resources and data sets to enable a much more powerful interpretation. Our solutions have to come to standard to interpret findings by leveraging a wide range of knowledge bases and data sets, sometimes even including a customer’s own data sets and findings. So this is why you see us offering a range of solutions for analyzing and interpreting biological data in various ways and behind which we are investing as well as attracting new partners. A great example is that QIAGEN and Inova Translational Medicine Institute had launched Inova Genomes, a unique compendium of a very large cohort of whole-genome sequencing data; which is highly annotated and described as well as ethnically and typically and test fully diverse.  The Inova partnership adds a great additional tool that further increases the value of our offering for researchers seeking to accelerate cohort analysis programs or improve success rates and diagnostic odyssey cases. QIAGEN serves as the exclusive distributor of the data base which is accessible by Ingenuity Variant Analysis and CLC Biomedical Genomics Workbench platforms. [Indiscernible] In precision medicine your ability to make impactful decisions and discoveries from each new data set rests heavily on analyzing the data in the richest context possible. How much information you have about other genomes and health outcomes associated with those genomes and what’s known from peer [ph] review published research. So an ethnically diverse genome database like the Inova genome database when paired with big data competition and expertly created content resources such as the ingenuity knowledge base can dramatically advance disease, research and drive the adoption of next generation sequencing in the clinical setting. As for our new commercial solutions the global rollout of QIAGEN clinically inside or QCI is building great momentum. This evidence based clinical decision to port solution design for clinical labs to use in the interpretation and reporting of complex genomic variance from NGS data. The first applications involve hereditary and somatic cancer panels. QCI or QIAGEN Clinical Insights and other solutions on this chart draw insights from QIAGEN and Genuity Knowledge base which you see here as the key content foundation and which has so far been used to analyze nearly 400,000 human genomic samples. Another new solution recently launched is the CLC Microbial Genomics Module within CLC software portfolio. This module enables academic and commercial researchers to focus on food production, agricultural biology and infectious diseases to visually explore and analyze microbions. As a standard setter, our approach is to be platform agnostic. At the same time, we will show that a perfect alignment with the platforms and assays on the GeneReader system will allow for a very unique sample to insight experience. I’m now on slide eight to discuss our recent entry into the high value segment of the U.S. forensics market. The U.S. is the largest market for forensics with around credited laboratories analyzing more than 4 million case working reference samples per year. In the U.S. we have been offering sample technologies and this is part of our very high market share and sample technologies for forensics around the world. We are in practically every laboratory worldwide conducting forensic testing with such sample technologies. Now, with the expiry of some patents in the United States we are entering the assay market segment with our investigator [Indiscernible] for genetic finger printing. Once those patents expired in June, QIAGEN became the first new entrant into a market which previously was a duopoly, the area of STR assays or short tandem repeats that is essential for DNA forensic testing as well as other types of genetic finger printing. The timing could not be better since U.S. labs are conditioning to comply with new FBI Standards in 2017. The new investigator STR kits fully comply with these requirements which include 24 markers compared to 13 before. In addition our new line of assays have many workflow benefits and a range of novel features. The most important new feature of our offering is a new quality sensor that evaluates the quality of DNA in each sample prior to going into time consuming and costly testing. This novel QIAGEN technology enables labs to therefore decide quickly which evidence may provide valuable results and overcome key concerns such as determining truly negative results assessing DNA degradation and also accessing inhibitors in the PCR process. QIAGEN is the global leader in sample technologies and human identification and forensics. With this franchise representing the majority of our applied testing customer class which contributed about 9% of overall sales to QIAGEN and also involves solution for veterinary medicine and food testing. We are already successfully commercialized in this new QIAGEN investigator STR kits in other regions of the world. So moving into this new segment in the United States offer some attractive incremental growth opportunities and be a chance to maximize the value of offering a full portfolio like elsewhere in the world. With that, I would like to hand over to Roland Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. Good afternoon to everyone in Europe, and good morning to those joining from the U.S. I’m now on slide nine and will begin with an overview of our financial performance for the second quarter. Starting with adjusted net sales, we delivered 5% towards growth at constant exchange rates which was higher than our target of 4% and driven by the outstanding 18% constant exchange rate growth in instrument sales. Consumers and related revenues were up 4% constant exchange rates in the quarter and represented 87% of sales. The acquisition of Enzymatics provided 2 percentage points while the rest of the portfolio generated 3 points of growth and that was after absorbing 3 percentage points lost to lower U.S HPV sales. The adverse currency movements created 9 percentage points of pressure on sales at actual rates which was in line with our expectations and led to the 4% decline through [Indiscernible] $19.5 million U.S. dollars. Moving down to income statement, the adjusted operating income margin had 20 basis points of improvement with about half coming from operational gains and the rest coming from currency benefits. On the adjusted gross margin we had a relatively high level of revenues from pharma co-developed project in the quarter and this was a key factor behind the decline of about 90 basis points. These revenues have a gross margin of about 30% to 50% which is below the company average; however keep in mind these revenues have a relatively high margin at adjusted operating income. Another factor versus strong growth in instruments which have a lower gross margins and consumers. As we previously announced the teams and activities at our site in Marseille, France were spun off earlier this year through the creation a new standalone company. These activities were focussed on the Ipsogen franchise where we have a strong leadership position just for the good solution for this side the employees and shareholders and we have future rights to sell their products and this transaction played a role in the overall lower level of RD investments for the second quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were generally flat compared to the same period in 2014 as we made investments in e-commerce and commercial activities by generating benefits from the efficiency program done last year. For the full year, we have a goal to improve the just operating income margin by at least 50 basis points and this is from the 25% underlying margin last year. The full year margin in 2014 was 23% but this included a restructuring charges taken in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that this target is based on actual FX rates. Adjusted net income was $60.9 million and this was unchanged from the year ago period. So adjusted tax rate was lower in the second quarter at 19% but in line with our outlook and this helped to more than offset an increase in total other expenses. Adjusted EPS was $0.28 per share at constant exchange rate which was above the target for $0.26 to $0.27. At – adjusted EPS was $0.26 per share which was ahead of $0.25 per share a year ago. The diluted share count for the second quarter was about 3.6 million shares below the same period of 2014 and this was due to the convertible bond we purchased earlier this year and shares we purchased over the last 12 months. Moving to slide 10, I would like to provide you with a quick overview of the customer classes. As noted earlier, these include contributions from the Enzymatics acquisitions in December 2014. Molecular diagnostics excluding U.S. HPV sales continued at a solid underlying 10% growth pace at constant exchange rate. We delivered double digit constant exchange rate sales expansion for the QuantiFERON latent and TB test and higher sales in personalized healthcare came from company diagnostic kits and significantly higher pharma co-developed project revenues. We also continued the strong pace of instruments and consumables sales growth momentum for the QIAsymphony system in the quarter as well. In the life science, applied testing led to the performance on the back of increasing demand in human ID and forensics. Trends improved in pharma as underlying business expansion at a mid single-digit constant exchange rate, and first time contributions from the Enzymatics acquisitions led to 7% constant exchange rate both in the quarter and for 5% constant exchange rate growth for the first half year. Academia delivered the same growth figures as pharma on the same mix of underlying growth at a moderate single digit constant exchange rate and contributions from Enzymatics. Here we are seeing more positive customer spending patterns in the U.S. and key European markets than the first half of 2015 and remain cautiously optimistic. I’m now on slide 11 to review sales on a regional basis for the second quarter. The top seven emerging markets delivered 11% growth at constant exchange rate in the second quarter and were up 16% for the first half.  China remains a bright spot rising at the highest single digit constant exchange rate and we also had solid performance in Turkey and Korea. On the other hand, Russia remains a challenge but has now become a small share of sales. Asia-Pacific Japan generated 14% constant exchange rate growth for the quarter and was up 10% constant exchange rate for the first half. In addition to China, Korea Japan or it’s a generated gains but like other companies we are cautious on the current funding trend. In the Europe, Middle East, Africa region sales were up 3% constant exchange rate for the quarter and up 6% constant exchange rate for the first half of the year led by the performance in Germany, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The Americas grew 11% excluding U.S. HPV sales and this came from QuantiFERON-TB test sales in the U.S. as well as gains in Applied Testing, Academia and Pharma. On slide 12 you have a view of our performance for the first half of the year. This was in line with our 2015 targets with a sales growth of 4% constant exchange rate matching our full year outlook. Adjusted EPS was up $0.05 per share at constant exchange rate for the first half of the year and this was in line with our planning and the same goes for the steady adjusted operating income margin at 24% of sales. So based on this performance and also our expectations for the second half of the year this prompted us to reaffirm the full year outlook we provided earlier this year and January. Moving to slide 13 we have a healthy financial position with manageable net debt to support business investments and returns to shareholders. Even with currency volatility, we still increased operating cash flow in the first half of the year. Free cash flow also rose for the first half of 2015 while absorbing higher investments in property, plant and equipment and this were mainly for internally developed software and expanding our U.S. presence especially in the Boston area. Our leverage has now increased to about 1.6 times net debt to EBITDA and this includes $250 million to repurchase the 20, 24 convertible notes earlier this year and remove 10 million shares of dilution risk. On the share repurchase we have about $30 million to grow in the $1200 [ph] million programs and our view is that this programs have been good way to increase swith-ons. The weighted average repurchase price is a short program so has been €19.22 and for all programs to date it is s €16.50 and this is below the current share price of about €25. I’m now on slide 14 which shows we are re-affirming the same full year guidance for 2015 that we announced in earlier this year in January. We continue to expect full year sales growth of about 4% at constant exchange rate. This is based on about 7 to 8 percentage points of constant exchange rate brought from our core portfolio against the [Indiscernible] of significant headwinds from the U.S. HPV test deals. And we continue to expect this to be about 3 to 4 percentage points. For adjusted EPS we continue to expect about $1.16 to $1.18 per share and this is at constant exchange rates. These expectations also include incremental sales on the Enzymatic acquisition that was completed in December of 2014. Moving to slide 15, here you see our outlook for the third quarter and details on the adjustments. For the third quarter our sales target is for 3% constant exchange rate growth and this is based on 3% points of headwinds from the U.S. HPV franchise against 6% constant exchange rate growth from the rest of the QIAGEN portfolio. This reflects our view to deliver on our full year target for 4% constant exchange rate growth and the anticipated distribution of sales between the third and fourth quarter. We are seeing more volatility in the timing of some of the larger blocks of sales in our portfolio such as from pharma development project or national tenders and this outlook is based on how we anticipate those revenues to be realised. We are also facing a tough comparison against the strong performance in the third quarter of 2014 when we had 10% constant exchange rate growth from the portfolio excluding U.S. HPV test fall out. And this is something we had factored into the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year and that we have reiterated. As for adjusted EPS for the third quarter our outlook is for $0.29 to $0.30 per share which is also at constant exchange rates. As for our views on currency movements the headwinds created by the strengthening U.S. dollars begin at the end of 2014 and they got worse during the first quarter at about 8 percentage points. We then saw even more volatility in the second quarter and about 9 percentage points of pressure on sales results at actual exchange rate. For the third quarter and based on rates as of June 30, we expect about 7 to 8 percentage points of currency pressure on sales. So given the outlook for 3% constant exchange rate sales growth this implies a – of about 4% to 5% at actual exchange rate. On adjusted EPS the currency impact is expected to be $0.02 so this implies $0.27 to $0.28 per share at actual rate. This slide also contains adjustments, exemptions for the full year and the third quarter. So tax rate remains unchanged at about 19%. With that I would like to hand back to Peer. Peer Schatz Yes, thank you, Roland. I am now on slide 16 for a quick summary before we move into Q&A. Let me review what we have announced. First, we delivered another solid performance in the second quarter of 2015, having exceeded our targets for adjusted net sales and EPS at constant exchange. We are pleased as well with the results for the first half of the year that put us on track to achieve our full year goals. Second, we are moving ahead on initiatives to transform QIAGEN and are demonstrating continued success in areas that are delivering strong growth in our very exciting futures. We have some important regulatory approvals and new product launches in the quarter particularly with EGFR companion diagnostic paired with IRESSA for lung cancer patients and a protocol to automate liquid biopsy sample platform QIAsymphony. All of this is in line with our ambitions to offer premium differentiator product and services to our customers in the life sciences and molecular diagnostics. The benefits of these efforts will become even more apparent during the second half of 2015 as we work through the final two quarters of significant headwinds from the declining sales in the U.S. HPV test franchise. Indeed this year is setting a good foundation for accelerating, innovation and growth from our core portfolio. And as Roland just outlined, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for higher adjusted net sales and EPS at constant exchange rates along with ambitions to improve our operational profitability and increase cash flow but again for results at exchange rates to be adversely impacted by currencies. With that I would like to hand back to the operator for the Q&A session. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar Hey thanks guys. Well So, Peer, a question on the growth driver. So I feel like there were a number of exciting sort of announcements within the press release. And I think couple which caught my attention was one on liquid biopsy. I think the term you used was breakthrough. So I'm just trying to understand sort of how big is this market opportunity for you guys and how does QIAGEN fit in? How do you think the growth from this particular end market could be for you guys and related to sort of liquid biopsy, I guess, was GeneRreeder and you said more to share later in the year? So would this be sort of some sort of specs on the system or maybe further updates on the commercialization or some sort of customer feedback I'm curious? Peer Schatz Hey, yes thanks for the question. So liquid biopsy is an important area of strategic initiative for us. We have significant efforts in this area and we are working on two [audio gap] that of the second generation. We had an earlier version before that we were able to substantially increase the speed of and also increase the flexibility also with the QIAGEN’s new platform we have now a platform that is slowly targeting clinical use and has the ability to flexibly process hefty samples, liquid biopsy samples all in parallel for downstream processing and this is important and at the speed that is sufficient even for a high throughput in ITT labs and had a precision that meets those requirements as well as those for instance in cancer. The market is substantial. It is still small and I see this huge numbers they depict [ph] out there in terms of the estimates of the market size. They typically include the full package of including also the services, so from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars per assay. The sample technology piece ranges somewhere in the range of $15 to $30 per assay. So you can just extrapolate the numbers, assume a high market share and that will be the goal for our franchise in that access. The second access is the one where we are pairing up the liquid biopsy strength with assays that we have. We were the first to introduce a regulated liquid biopsy assay also with IRESSA earlier this year for the companion diagnostic and we are also ensuring that all of our downstream assays and panels are already liquid biopsy compatible and hence also the reference that you just made, the GeneReader. Yes, the GeneRead panels that we have in the market today they are already liquid biopsy ready while other suppliers in to this market typically require some sort of front end modification to the assays to make them compactible. So the same assay that can run off FFPE samples can also be run after liquid biopsy samples and we think that’s incredibly important to ensure good work flow opportunities and also efficiencies in clinical laboratories. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Please go ahead. Brian Weinstein Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk a little bit about personalized healthcare; you had a very strong quarter. I'm wondering if you could kind of give us the size of that business now and talk through the components between the FDA approved tests and the partnerships in terms of that size. And also when thinking about working with these pharma partners, what technology platforms are of interest to them at this point PCR, next-gen sequencing, ModaPlex can you just sort of flesh that out a bit for us? Thanks. Peer Schatz Great, thanks Brian. The franchise is definitely doing extremely well, and it's obviously well north of 100 million including all the components of which the majority are kit sales. The numbers for the partnership contracts is a third or less of that numbers so the majority is actually recurring revenue streams. And the number of partnerships and also the breadth of the menu had been at record level this year. We have never seen such strong inflow of new partnerships and deals as we’ve seen in the first half of 2015 and obviously this is great for the future menu development and expansion of the portfolio. The platforms that expands – still a lot of the drugs are preferring PCR due to the very clear path forward. In terms of the regulatory path, in term of reimbursement and this is true in almost all geographies across the world. That said, we are also starting to see first next-gen sequencing programs and we are working on several already today, and very often in parallel to PCR assays to make sure that we can also address the global differences and reimbursement and regulatory. So many countries will be extremely difficult to – or it will take quite some time until they will be ready for next-gen sequencing so their PCR assets would be preferred in testing both in parallel as a big benefit. So that’s number two. And what we’ve actually seen a remarkable interest in is in ModaPlex. ModaPlex which is a platform we are not commercialising actively at the moment, but we are prepping here for companion diagnostic usage is receiving also here a record inflow of new partnerships that are using this multi modality capability of that platform. And also see great value that platform is already FDA-cleared and also has a very clear path to reimbursement. So we are not platform agnostic, we are not trying to force a platform onto the pharma partners but are trying to do what is best for their update of the drug and that has been resonating very well with pharma and the inflow it’s just remarkable that we’ve seen this year. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan Hi, thanks and good morning and good afternoon. I just want to start and ask about QuantiFERON and the growth in the quarter. I'm curious with some of the publications at the start the year whether you thought you had seen any changes in the market share. And then also just to how far along you thought you were in converting from the 3G product to the new fourth generation out on the market? Peer Schatz Sure, thanks. So the 4G has been on the market since earlier this year and we’ve seen good uptake. As always it take some time for this transition to happen as laboratories have their existing validation routines and procedures. And the uptake is moving ahead quite nicely now in Europe. The lag that you typically see is at least a few months, six months or so, we’re kind of like now moving through that. The 4G product has a number of features that are easy to see the immediate benefit for, the workflow benefits for instance, the one, two collection and all these things that the quality comparability with the leading quality of 3G product. But some of the benefits such as the ability to differentiate between active and latent are features that we’re still currently working on and you’ve seen some announcements both in developed world but also in developing world where we’re actually validating this already. So this is going to be a multiyear validation process, but we’re well underway on that as well. So 4G is going to move into the U.S. markets as well once we get the PMA on that and the timing is hopefully not far away. And this would allow us to start the active conversions in the states where we do see some benefits in particular off from the workflow side. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Please go ahead. Daniel Wendorff  Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to go back to slide eight actually just to better understand the market opportunities there and would you be the only company entering the assay technologies markets and following the expiry of certain patents as you just mentioned, and I assume that you just have another product for an existing customer marketing infrastructures, is that correct? Peer Schatz The latter is definitely correct, and we are in all of these laboratories are into today, it’s a market we really like serving. It’s a technologically very challenging and one that we’ve been for at least 25 years now. And the second part of the question is, there are IP position, new IP positions now have to the access and also license, and so we think that if you look at the all these players in the market I couldn’t imagine anybody here now the near term to the market which would have meaningful impact. This is a market that is definitely going to be PCR for quite a long time and extremely conservative market and were the costs and other benefits of this technology are just well ahead of anything else, and so we see that this is probably going to remain pretty stable for the next few years with the exception of the few smaller segments of the market where you might see diversification. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard Thank you. So, two-part question on the bioinformatics business. One, disclose the growth rate of the bioinformatics business in the quarter? And then secondly, could you elaborate on the launch of Clinical Insight? You mentioned it was a positive launch above expectations, but can you convey what the bogey was and what you delivered? Thank you. Peer Schatz Sure. So, I’ll talk very briefly about the launch and Rolland you can take the financial question. The launch went extremely well and it has surpassed our expectations. Clinical Insights is hitting a very important need in the market as clinical use of high bandwidth technologies have been increasing particular in next-gen sequencing and this has led to enormous backlog very often and work our efforts that very often mean library visits and just working through all of the variants that available in the institution. And we’re basically using the cloud solutions that we’ve created. Actually, somebody recently told me that we were actually the first life science company in the cloud early almost 15 years ago which was the first in Ingenuity product and we’re basically leveraging that now for clinical use ensuring up to-date information which is valuable for clinical labs so they don’t make wrong calls. So this uptake is going extremely. We’re obviously leveraging a lot of contacts that we have across the clinical industry and are using shared sales channels with the specialists and also the generalist strategic account [ph] managers, so this is early in the uptake phase, but we’re very pleased with the uptake and many high profile names have joined the customer roaster. Rolland? Roland Sackers Hi, Dan. Bioinformatics is doing well on a year to-date to ends this quarter at double-digit pace and I think its probably more important we’re fully more important, it clearly also comes to the very healthy gross margin [Indiscernible] you know we invest significantly into R&Ds, so there’s no significant EBIT contribution this year, but clearly it setup the change as going forward. So we’re quite pleased with the business. Operator Our next question comes from the line Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel Hi, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. Peer, the QIAGEN portfolio has evolved quite a bit over the past few years, and if you look back over the past few quarters, including this one. If you exclude U.S. HPV FX and M&A consumables then related revenue growth has been around 5% with some error bars around that. And within that 5% there have been areas that have been and appear poised to grow much more quickly and we've talked a lot about these, but they include some of the nice assets you've picked up in bioinformatics, latent TB, the efforts in liquid biopsy and as we talked about earlier today, the outlook for growth in certain new applied areas. That said, there is also some core areas other than U.S. HPV that continue to be lower growth. So when you think about the puts and takes, given all the strategic activity and internal development that you've undertaken, would you view 5% to 6% normalized consumables growth as a disappointment as we look ahead to 2016 and beyond? And I guess as a follow-up, if you believe that QIAGEN is now built to grow it and inherently higher growth rate than that, have the investments you've already made position you to generate a pickup in operating margin leverage over the next few years? Thank you. Peer Schatz Thanks, Doug. So the growth rate that achieved in the second quarter was slightly higher than what we had guided for, so we are definitely pleased with the momentum across the portfolio. You’re absolutely right we clearly have big exposures in areas that is academic research which is not really growing with the exception of next-gen sequencing and are 67 million exposure in this space are growing at a higher growth rate is not enough to push the several hundred million that we have exposed to the lower growth academic segments. That said the percentage of revenues that are growing at high double-digit growth rates are now north of a third of the company and growing substantially. So, our goal is to not only maintained but to try to accelerate this growth rate over the next period and we’ll give guidance for 2016 and as we always do in January and we clearly have stated however that we are striving to a increase the underlying growth rate due to the heavier exposure to higher growth segments within our portfolio. And that’s why we’re emphasizing them so much because we believe that all of them have very long trajectories that we’ll be able to benefit from. Roland Sackers And Doug on your margin question, I think the best way to answer is also look just on what we have seen in the second quarter and also what we guided now for the third quarter and the rest of the year and having mindset within this quarter. We still have a quite significant headwind on the U.S. HPV side which clearly comes still as a very healthy gross margin. Despite this fact we are still able to improve our operating margin as we have seen this quarter by roughly 50 bps, so it’s now going away and fading out over the course of the next few quarters. I think we feel quite concerned [ph] in terms of overall operating margin improvement as we announced before. Operator  Our next question comes from the line Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Elliott  Thanks guys. A couple of quick ones for Roland here. Roland, can you talk about free cash flow, what's your outlook for the next couple of years? And then on the leverage, it has worked its way up a bit. What sort of metrics -- where would you expect to be or where would you be comfortable seeing that you are now under leveraged? Roland Sackers Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. On the free cash flow we clearly are doing quite comfortable with the developments we’ve now seen over the first six quarters. We do expect also similar developments going forward. The cash conversion remains about 100% and I think there is clearly an area where we also working on, focusing on and have still in mind that we did a lot of restructuring in 2014, happy that we went out of that and we’re still in the earning mode on that, so again there’s more to come. On the net debt to EBITDA side, I would say, right now we still feel clearly still under leveraged. We are very much committed to capital allocation as we said before. We are now still have some openness in our$800 [ph] million share buyback program, that’s clearly one thing and more important is probably also in terms of cash flow and then fire power at the same time nearly up to three [ph] is still reasonable for company with cash contribution, with the cash generation we are having, so I think there’s a lot of room for us to be flexible on the strategy side as well on the capital allocation side in general. Operator Next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush Securities. Please go head. Zarak Khurshid  Hi there everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. As we think about your total liquid biopsy related businesses versus your NIPT exposure. Any sense that you can quantify for us kind of in an absolute sense how large these buckets are and/or how fast they are growing? And then as a follow-up, just curious how -- as those end markets continue to grow very fast, how does your business scale with that? Does it grow at kind of a slightly reduced rate to the end market or do you kind of keep pace? Thanks a lot. Peer Schatz Sure. So, as you know there are few million liquid biopsy test performed every year, the majority are NIPT, its maybe a quarter or cancer today and lot of them exploratory maybe a third. But the cancer piece is growing quite substantially and its very, very different to the NIPT market, the NIPT market is under intense competition and also in price and cost pressure and the cancer market is one which is more exploratory and one which is emerging quite quickly and clearly as a different reimbursement setting as well. So the market going forward will see volume increase significantly, we’ll see the volume growth driven through a much larger degree by cancer going forward and the prices are very stable in caner, very attractive in cancer for the foreseeable future and NIPT will be a more competitive, cost competitive market. This franchise is a few tens of million now for us but it is one that is – its clearly one that we’re investing in and as you see from the numbers very, very strong leadership positions and we’re fueling that with great new products that we have both organically and also inorganically added to the portfolio. Operator Our next question comes from the line Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro Hi, good morning. Thank you, guys. Question for you on sample prep technology, you guys gave a lot of color on the various end markets that you serve and you've obviously got a lot going on in next-gen sequencing. And I was curious, if you could maybe take a different cut at the numbers and specifically wondering with all the growth that we're seeing in next-gen sequencing, obviously your assembled prep gets used quite a bit. Can you give us a sense of how much year-to-date your sample prep business tied to NGS has grown and sort of how you're thinking about that opportunity because you're clearly still in a very strong position of benefit from that volume growth? Peer Schatz Sure. Thanks, Isaac. So, we once put out a number that we think that about 85% of all samples that are process for next-gen sequencing, our process typically using QIAGEN sample technology upfront. Where the confusion kicks in is that people talked about sample preparation for next-gen sequencing which includes the library preparation steps, which is a multi-hundred million dollar business. When we talk about sample technologies, that means the processing of a drop of blood or a piece of tissue into purified isolated nucleic acid and in that area, what we call sample technologies, our market shares are very, very high, so it can almost – and the challenges for next-gen sequencing are very significant in terms of requiring good pure nucleic acid, because very often the input volumes are very small so you won’t have a very clean and good sample going into these very cost intensive and expensive downstream assays. That said, next-gen sequencing is only a very, very small fraction of all sample processing being done in research diagnostic even though the market is multi-billion dollar market and the cost of the assay is very often logs higher than what you would typical have with PCR or other molecular assays and hence the volumes are still immensely higher in the non-NGS areas compared to the NGS areas. So volume growth in this area is meaningful for us is dollar amount but as an overall revenue contributor its one that will all the time but currently is still not the major within the academic as well as clinical segments of our business. Operator Next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Dan Arias Good morning. Thanks for the question, guys. On QIAsymphony rolling, I think you guys said that consumables' pull-through on the system was up 25% or so last year, just wondering whether as boxes this year track in line with that 250 or so you placed last year, are you thinking the 2015 pull through will track in line at 25% as well. And then can you just remind us what to look for in terms of new tests and timing for new products in the back half? Thanks. Roland Sackers Yes. Let me take the first part of the question. Yes, I think we see actually similar trends in 2015 as well as, so we are quite happy with QIAsymphony performance in general, I know from the outside there’s always a lot of focus on placement, but as you pointed out correctly it's even as important and probably more important for us to pull through on the instruments and there is clearly a number which is still going to be significantly double-digit and I don’t see any reason that its going to change, and menu expansion, Peer. Peer Schatz Menu expansion is ongoing with the focus currently on Europe, so we have several new assays come onto the platform in Europe that are doing quite well, as you see us from replacements in that region. So we’re well on track to make the 250 target for this year. And that said, we are very selective in the menu that we’re putting on to the system because we’re seeing great traction in particular also in the LBT field and so having select markers to augment that differentiation is in a good value proposition for a customers in the U.S. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Derik De Bruin Hi, good morning. Hey, I have one quick clean up question for Roland and then another one, the cleanup question is the FX impacts to EPS in Q3 and Q4 and then the bigger question is we've seen some companies in the next-gen sequencing space have to reduce guidance because they're not getting reimbursement. I guess can you talk a little bit about how you sort of see the reimbursement for the panels sort of playing out? What sort of milestones are you looking for in terms of getting increased volumes and just talk about you're like the competitive dynamic in the panel space because there is a lot of vendors out there? Roland Sackers Let me go off here [Indiscernible] Derik, so FX impact on EPS on adjusted side for the third quarter using June status where it is probably around $0.02 for the four quarter probably down to $0.01. Peer Schatz Yes. And to the first part, you’re absolutely right, and we’ve talked about this many times in the past. I think there’s a general enthusiasm around next-gen sequencing, but the realities are definitely starting to hit. And the realities are visible in the slow adoption and reimbursement. But if you go deeper into why this is a case, you’ll see that the validation of markers is in many cases just not sufficient to justify these broad panels and there had to be a lot of additional validation work or justification of use of the markers that last one to get reimbursement for. This is one of the reasons why the QIAGEN clinical insight is such an important tool because we are giving laboratories at the push of a button a comprehensive justification for the markers that are being tested for around certain disease areas. And this is I think one thing that we’ve seen laboratories really about this is that it is helping them prepare the submission – the reimbursement of test they perform. And going forward the panels will definitely want to rely markers that are sufficiently validated and the question is will this be 50 markers or be 15. This is still a little bit out there. It probably won’t be 100 at now for a few years, because large number of these markers are just not validated yet sufficiently that would allow for clinical reimbursement and as the cost still quite high you see the number of markers and the costs correlate into a curve that put some out of I think reasonable at some point. So we think these targeted panels likely for instance offer the Ingenuity panels and doing very well. They are targeting very well validated markers and are in that one dozen to several dozen markers, hotspot panels might be over 100, but the focus on clinical validation is an action ability is going to become the focus going forward for laboratories and not just what can we read and how much can we read. There are some interesting pieces coming out for many of you or you’re saying, its not about the box, its really about the utility that the box generates and there we certainly see a mismatch being at in cost, being at reimbursement, being the regulatory pathways and I think as an industry we need to be very prudent and how we push this forward to make sure that we also create some thing that the healthcare system is well be able to benefit from economically and clinically. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Bill Quirk Great. Thanks and good morning everyone. Two quick questions from me. First is on the clinical instrument strength. Can you also think a little bit about the difference between let’s say the strength in QIAsymphony for running molecular assays versus some of like say, the NGS base strength and things like QIAcube and other instruments? Peer Schatz So what is interesting Bill is that the QIAsymphony is getting great uptake in the NGS labs in particular also due to its ability to process some many different sample types in a highly automated way, especially for labs that are doing larger batches and for instance also NIPT labs. So QIAsymphony received a surprising good uptake in the first wave. We also knew it would be in very attractive position, but as it was primarily perceived as a clinical instrument the adoption has been just very, very positive. The QIAcube is we have double-digit thousand number of these same things out there, they are all over the place and they are like 200 protocols running or 250 protocols running on this thing, so most of the laboratories actually have a QIAsymphony maybe even a QIAcube for very exotic applications as well in addition to QIAsymphony in their laboratories. So it is a clinical instrument at one side but they are also sticking to NGS samples on to it as well. John Gilardi Okay. I’d like to close this conference call.

And our first question today comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar Hey thanks guys. Well So, Peer, a question on the growth driver. So I feel like there were a number of exciting sort of announcements within the press release. And I think couple which caught my attention was one on liquid biopsy. I think the term you used was breakthrough. So I'm just trying to understand sort of how big is this market opportunity for you guys and how does QIAGEN fit in? How do you think the growth from this particular end market could be for you guys and related to sort of liquid biopsy, I guess, was GeneRreeder and you said more to share later in the year? So would this be sort of some sort of specs on the system or maybe further updates on the commercialization or some sort of customer feedback I'm curious? Peer Schatz Hey, yes thanks for the question. So liquid biopsy is an important area of strategic initiative for us. We have significant efforts in this area and we are working on two [audio gap] that of the second generation. We had an earlier version before that we were able to substantially increase the speed of and also increase the flexibility also with the QIAGEN’s new platform we have now a platform that is slowly targeting clinical use and has the ability to flexibly process hefty samples, liquid biopsy samples all in parallel for downstream processing and this is important and at the speed that is sufficient even for a high throughput in ITT labs and had a precision that meets those requirements as well as those for instance in cancer. The market is substantial. It is still small and I see this huge numbers they depict [ph] out there in terms of the estimates of the market size. They typically include the full package of including also the services, so from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars per assay. The sample technology piece ranges somewhere in the range of $15 to $30 per assay. So you can just extrapolate the numbers, assume a high market share and that will be the goal for our franchise in that access. The second access is the one where we are pairing up the liquid biopsy strength with assays that we have. We were the first to introduce a regulated liquid biopsy assay also with IRESSA earlier this year for the companion diagnostic and we are also ensuring that all of our downstream assays and panels are already liquid biopsy compatible and hence also the reference that you just made, the GeneReader. Yes, the GeneRead panels that we have in the market today they are already liquid biopsy ready while other suppliers in to this market typically require some sort of front end modification to the assays to make them compactible. So the same assay that can run off FFPE samples can also be run after liquid biopsy samples and we think that’s incredibly important to ensure good work flow opportunities and also efficiencies in clinical laboratories. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Please go ahead. Brian Weinstein Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk a little bit about personalized healthcare; you had a very strong quarter. I'm wondering if you could kind of give us the size of that business now and talk through the components between the FDA approved tests and the partnerships in terms of that size. And also when thinking about working with these pharma partners, what technology platforms are of interest to them at this point PCR, next-gen sequencing, ModaPlex can you just sort of flesh that out a bit for us? Thanks. Peer Schatz Great, thanks Brian. The franchise is definitely doing extremely well, and it's obviously well north of 100 million including all the components of which the majority are kit sales. The numbers for the partnership contracts is a third or less of that numbers so the majority is actually recurring revenue streams. And the number of partnerships and also the breadth of the menu had been at record level this year. We have never seen such strong inflow of new partnerships and deals as we’ve seen in the first half of 2015 and obviously this is great for the future menu development and expansion of the portfolio. The platforms that expands – still a lot of the drugs are preferring PCR due to the very clear path forward. In terms of the regulatory path, in term of reimbursement and this is true in almost all geographies across the world. That said, we are also starting to see first next-gen sequencing programs and we are working on several already today, and very often in parallel to PCR assays to make sure that we can also address the global differences and reimbursement and regulatory. So many countries will be extremely difficult to – or it will take quite some time until they will be ready for next-gen sequencing so their PCR assets would be preferred in testing both in parallel as a big benefit. So that’s number two. And what we’ve actually seen a remarkable interest in is in ModaPlex. ModaPlex which is a platform we are not commercialising actively at the moment, but we are prepping here for companion diagnostic usage is receiving also here a record inflow of new partnerships that are using this multi modality capability of that platform. And also see great value that platform is already FDA-cleared and also has a very clear path to reimbursement. So we are not platform agnostic, we are not trying to force a platform onto the pharma partners but are trying to do what is best for their update of the drug and that has been resonating very well with pharma and the inflow it’s just remarkable that we’ve seen this year. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan Hi, thanks and good morning and good afternoon. I just want to start and ask about QuantiFERON and the growth in the quarter. I'm curious with some of the publications at the start the year whether you thought you had seen any changes in the market share. And then also just to how far along you thought you were in converting from the 3G product to the new fourth generation out on the market? Peer Schatz Sure, thanks. So the 4G has been on the market since earlier this year and we’ve seen good uptake. As always it take some time for this transition to happen as laboratories have their existing validation routines and procedures. And the uptake is moving ahead quite nicely now in Europe. The lag that you typically see is at least a few months, six months or so, we’re kind of like now moving through that. The 4G product has a number of features that are easy to see the immediate benefit for, the workflow benefits for instance, the one, two collection and all these things that the quality comparability with the leading quality of 3G product. But some of the benefits such as the ability to differentiate between active and latent are features that we’re still currently working on and you’ve seen some announcements both in developed world but also in developing world where we’re actually validating this already. So this is going to be a multiyear validation process, but we’re well underway on that as well. So 4G is going to move into the U.S. markets as well once we get the PMA on that and the timing is hopefully not far away. And this would allow us to start the active conversions in the states where we do see some benefits in particular off from the workflow side. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Please go ahead. Daniel Wendorff  Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to go back to slide eight actually just to better understand the market opportunities there and would you be the only company entering the assay technologies markets and following the expiry of certain patents as you just mentioned, and I assume that you just have another product for an existing customer marketing infrastructures, is that correct? Peer Schatz The latter is definitely correct, and we are in all of these laboratories are into today, it’s a market we really like serving. It’s a technologically very challenging and one that we’ve been for at least 25 years now. And the second part of the question is, there are IP position, new IP positions now have to the access and also license, and so we think that if you look at the all these players in the market I couldn’t imagine anybody here now the near term to the market which would have meaningful impact. This is a market that is definitely going to be PCR for quite a long time and extremely conservative market and were the costs and other benefits of this technology are just well ahead of anything else, and so we see that this is probably going to remain pretty stable for the next few years with the exception of the few smaller segments of the market where you might see diversification. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard Thank you. So, two-part question on the bioinformatics business. One, disclose the growth rate of the bioinformatics business in the quarter? And then secondly, could you elaborate on the launch of Clinical Insight? You mentioned it was a positive launch above expectations, but can you convey what the bogey was and what you delivered? Thank you. Peer Schatz Sure. So, I’ll talk very briefly about the launch and Rolland you can take the financial question. The launch went extremely well and it has surpassed our expectations. Clinical Insights is hitting a very important need in the market as clinical use of high bandwidth technologies have been increasing particular in next-gen sequencing and this has led to enormous backlog very often and work our efforts that very often mean library visits and just working through all of the variants that available in the institution. And we’re basically using the cloud solutions that we’ve created. Actually, somebody recently told me that we were actually the first life science company in the cloud early almost 15 years ago which was the first in Ingenuity product and we’re basically leveraging that now for clinical use ensuring up to-date information which is valuable for clinical labs so they don’t make wrong calls. So this uptake is going extremely. We’re obviously leveraging a lot of contacts that we have across the clinical industry and are using shared sales channels with the specialists and also the generalist strategic account [ph] managers, so this is early in the uptake phase, but we’re very pleased with the uptake and many high profile names have joined the customer roaster. Rolland? Roland Sackers Hi, Dan.

When we talk about sample technologies, that means the processing of a drop of blood or a piece of tissue into purified isolated nucleic acid and in that area, what we call sample technologies, our market shares are very, very high, so it can almost – and the challenges for next-gen sequencing are very significant in terms of requiring good pure nucleic acid, because very often the input volumes are very small so you won’t have a very clean and good sample going into these very cost intensive and expensive downstream assays. That said, next-gen sequencing is only a very, very small fraction of all sample processing being done in research diagnostic even though the market is multi-billion dollar market and the cost of the assay is very often logs higher than what you would typical have with PCR or other molecular assays and hence the volumes are still immensely higher in the non-NGS areas compared to the NGS areas. So volume growth in this area is meaningful for us is dollar amount but as an overall revenue contributor its one that will all the time but currently is still not the major within the academic as well as clinical segments of our business. Operator Next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Dan Arias Good morning. Thanks for the question, guys. On QIAsymphony rolling, I think you guys said that consumables' pull-through on the system was up 25% or so last year, just wondering whether as boxes this year track in line with that 250 or so you placed last year, are you thinking the 2015 pull through will track in line at 25% as well. And then can you just remind us what to look for in terms of new tests and timing for new products in the back half? Thanks. Roland Sackers Yes. Let me take the first part of the question. Yes, I think we see actually similar trends in 2015 as well as, so we are quite happy with QIAsymphony performance in general, I know from the outside there’s always a lot of focus on placement, but as you pointed out correctly it's even as important and probably more important for us to pull through on the instruments and there is clearly a number which is still going to be significantly double-digit and I don’t see any reason that its going to change, and menu expansion, Peer. Peer Schatz Menu expansion is ongoing with the focus currently on Europe, so we have several new assays come onto the platform in Europe that are doing quite well, as you see us from replacements in that region. So we’re well on track to make the 250 target for this year. And that said, we are very selective in the menu that we’re putting on to the system because we’re seeing great traction in particular also in the LBT field and so having select markers to augment that differentiation is in a good value proposition for a customers in the U.S. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Derik De Bruin Hi, good morning. Hey, I have one quick clean up question for Roland and then another one, the cleanup question is the FX impacts to EPS in Q3 and Q4 and then the bigger question is we've seen some companies in the next-gen sequencing space have to reduce guidance because they're not getting reimbursement. I guess can you talk a little bit about how you sort of see the reimbursement for the panels sort of playing out? What sort of milestones are you looking for in terms of getting increased volumes and just talk about you're like the competitive dynamic in the panel space because there is a lot of vendors out there? Roland Sackers Let me go off here [Indiscernible] Derik, so FX impact on EPS on adjusted side for the third quarter using June status where it is probably around $0.02 for the four quarter probably down to $0.01. Peer Schatz Yes. And to the first part, you’re absolutely right, and we’ve talked about this many times in the past. I think there’s a general enthusiasm around next-gen sequencing, but the realities are definitely starting to hit. And the realities are visible in the slow adoption and reimbursement. But if you go deeper into why this is a case, you’ll see that the validation of markers is in many cases just not sufficient to justify these broad panels and there had to be a lot of additional validation work or justification of use of the markers that last one to get reimbursement for. This is one of the reasons why the QIAGEN clinical insight is such an important tool because we are giving laboratories at the push of a button a comprehensive justification for the markers that are being tested for around certain disease areas. And this is I think one thing that we’ve seen laboratories really about this is that it is helping them prepare the submission – the reimbursement of test they perform. And going forward the panels will definitely want to rely markers that are sufficiently validated and the question is will this be 50 markers or be 15. This is still a little bit out there. It probably won’t be 100 at now for a few years, because large number of these markers are just not validated yet sufficiently that would allow for clinical reimbursement and as the cost still quite high you see the number of markers and the costs correlate into a curve that put some out of I think reasonable at some point. So we think these targeted panels likely for instance offer the Ingenuity panels and doing very well. They are targeting very well validated markers and are in that one dozen to several dozen markers, hotspot panels might be over 100, but the focus on clinical validation is an action ability is going to become the focus going forward for laboratories and not just what can we read and how much can we read. There are some interesting pieces coming out for many of you or you’re saying, its not about the box, its really about the utility that the box generates and there we certainly see a mismatch being at in cost, being at reimbursement, being the regulatory pathways and I think as an industry we need to be very prudent and how we push this forward to make sure that we also create some thing that the healthcare system is well be able to benefit from economically and clinically. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Bill Quirk Great. Thanks and good morning everyone. Two quick questions from me. First is on the clinical instrument strength. Can you also think a little bit about the difference between let’s say the strength in QIAsymphony for running molecular assays versus some of like say, the NGS base strength and things like QIAcube and other instruments? Peer Schatz So what is interesting Bill is that the QIAsymphony is getting great uptake in the NGS labs in particular also due to its ability to process some many different sample types in a highly automated way, especially for labs that are doing larger batches and for instance also NIPT labs. So QIAsymphony received a surprising good uptake in the first wave. We also knew it would be in very attractive position, but as it was primarily perceived as a clinical instrument the adoption has been just very, very positive. The QIAcube is we have double-digit thousand number of these same things out there, they are all over the place and they are like 200 protocols running or 250 protocols running on this thing, so most of the laboratories actually have a QIAsymphony maybe even a QIAcube for very exotic applications as well in addition to QIAsymphony in their laboratories. So it is a clinical instrument at one side but they are also sticking to NGS samples on to it as well. John Gilardi Okay. I’d like to close this conference call.

And welcome to all of you. QIAGEN continues to move ahead on initiatives during this year to accelerate growth in 2015 and beyond and these are reflected in our results for the third quarter and first nine months of this year. I have these messages to summarize our performance. First, our results for the third quarter: We saw solid developments in our Academia, Pharma, Applied Testing customer classes, but at the same time more moderate growth in Molecular Diagnostics also when excluded the expected adverse impact of declining U.S. HPV sales. We also saw overall challenging conditions in Japan and China. This led to adjusted net sales rising 2% at constant exchange rates. At the same time, adjusted earnings per share were $0.29 at constant exchange rates and in line with our target. We maintained the adjusted operating income margin at 25% of sales and this was after making a decision to step up incremental investments into sales and marketing activities. We feel this will help us prepare for the faster growth phases following the approaching end of the HPV headwinds. Adjusted net sales were $315 million at actual rates which was a decline of 7% and included a stronger than expected adverse impact from foreign currency movements. We had expected about 7 to 8 percentage points but it was then actually about 9 percentage points. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.27 at actual rates which was unchanged from the third quarter of 2014. Second, we are moving ahead on transforming QIAGEN and preparing to accelerate growth into 2016 and beyond. As you know, our performance over the last few years has been marked by the sharp impact of declining revenues of HPV tests in United States used for cervical cancer screening against solid growth from the rest of the portfolio. We saw the same situation in the third quarter. Sharply lower U.S. sales of HPV tests created about 3 percentage points of headwind which was in line with our expectations against the 2% constant exchange rate overall growth; and this applies about 5% constant exchange rate growth from the rest of the portfolio. Third, we are on track to achieve our full year target for higher adjusted net sales and earnings per share at constant exchange rates. Adjusted net sales are expected to rise about 4 percentage points on constant exchange rate basis. We have tightened the full year target for adjusted earnings per share to a $1.16 at constant exchange rates which is within the range we had set in January 2015. Moving to slide five, this shows you how QIAGEN has been growing during this challenging transformation. As you know, we have been taking heavy price pressure on our U.S. HPV test franchise in United States and this was due primarily to competition induced dramatically lower prices. For the full year in 2015, we continue to expect about 3 to 4 percentage points of headwind and this is in line with the results for the first nine months of the year. We also expect these sales to only represent about 3 percentage points of our total sales for 2015, so any future change in this HPV franchise is not expected to have a major impact on overall sales. At the same time, we are growing and investing into rest of our portfolio which generated 7 percentage points constant exchange rates sales growth during the first nine months of 2015 and provided 96% of our sales. This is why we are making the incremental investments to help drive this acceleration. I’m now on slide six to discuss some highlight for the third quarter. On the QIAsymphony automation platform, we are moving ahead towards our goal for 250 new placements during the year which would bring the cumulative placements to more than 1,500 systems. Also during the quarter, we launched in Europe the first multiplex asset to run on QIAsymphony RGQ. The RespiFast RG Panel received CE-IVD marking for the detection and differentiation of 22 pathogens, 18 viruses and 4 bacteria that cause respiratory tract infections in human.  Moving down to next generation sequencing, preparations are progressing as planned towards commercialization of the GeneReader benchtop next generation sequencing workflow later this year. I’m now on slide seven for a quick update on QuantiFERON, our latent TB test that is setting new standards for detection of this potentially deadly infection. As you see on the left side, sales have been ramping up and we are on track for about 20% growth this year at constant exchange rates. In the United States, I wanted to note that we had rest [ph] months in August and September. The third quarter is traditionally the strongest quarter of the year due to back to school testing. We significantly revamped and expanded our sales organization during the first half of 2015 and we are now seeing a very positive impact. We are also using digital media campaigns to target various groups such as parent with children going back to school. In Europe, we had a strong quarter in terms of sales growth with accelerating adoption of the fourth generation QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus that was launched earlier this year. Moving on to China where we introduced QuantiFERON during 2014, we’re making progress on our commercialization efforts in the top tier cities. We’re building a strong national distribution network and sales so far have quadrupled and are set to exceed $2 million. While this is still a small number, it is the ramp that we are focused on and that is excellent for such a screening test that needs time to adopt. Our efforts are ramping up well as move ahead on the validation and reimbursement discussions required to bring the screening test into this large market. Beyond the top markets, we are expanding the use of QuantiFERON into other regions such as Southeast Asia. In August, Stop TB and QIAGEN organized a regional meeting in Indonesia for key opinion leaders from more than 20 countries and the World Health Organization, WHO to discuss TB prevention standards. The reason is that the WHO and others realize that the fight against latent TB infections is critical to controlling the disease overall. So, we see significant growth prospects ahead in this $1 billion market opportunity. I’m now on slide eight for a quick update on the progress in our personalized healthcare portfolio where we are expanding our position as the top partner to pharma companies for companion diagnostics. Among recent highlights was that our teams reached new master collaboration agreements with two pharma companies. This brings the number of publicly announced deals to 12, under which we have framework agreements for collaborations involving multiple biomarkers. The inflow of new projects has never been stronger and spans across all platforms and this includes QIAsymphony and ModaPlex as well as next generation sequencing and our gene panels. We recently added new projects involving key biomarkers such as EGFR and KRAS who have seen so far the most regulatory and commercial success and as well for IDH1 and 2, FGFR, PI3-Kinase, BRAF. On our last call, we mentioned the FDA approval in July of a therascreen EGFR kit as a companion diagnostic to guide the use of AstraZeneca’s targeted lung cancer therapy IRESSA. This marks the fourth U.S. regulatory approval of a QIAGEN companion diagnostics paired with the cancers therapy. Since then, we have completed the submission of the therascreen EGFR kit for use as a companion diagnostic with Clovis Oncology’s rociletinib therapy for use in a specific type of patient with lung cancer differentiated by the status of the T790M mutation in the EGFR gene. So having these multiple approvals linked to our KRAS and EGFR kits means that we’re setting new standards. A fast growing part of our offering involves liquid biopsy sample technologies which have the potential to improve outcomes of patients. On this slide, you see two recent journal articles mentioning liquid biopsy solutions. In these cases, they are using our QIAamp circulating nucleic acid kit for the isolation of free-circulating DNA from plasma. This is the kit we have also automated on the QIAsymphony; commercial demand has been extremely strong. I am now on -- in general, we have created strong standards and have a broad range of solutions for liquid biopsy sample processing, and that is the real challenge since these QIAGEN solutions are used in almost every laboratory working in this area. The first studies here involve using liquid biopsy in the 54-gene next generation sequencing panel to detect somatic mutations in patients with metastatic solid cancer tumors. This prospective blinded study done by Guardant Health showed the free-circulating DNA panel revealed a very high sensitivity specificity and accuracy compared with tissue-based reference standard analysis for the KRAS and BRAF biomarkers in colorectal cancer patients. The second study involves researches MD Anderson and the trial involving actionable mutations in patients with advanced cancers referring for experimental targeted therapies. Among the findings was that testing of cell-free DNA demonstrated acceptable concordance with standard of care mutation analysis of primary or metastatic tumor tissue obtained during clinical care. As we have said before, we see significant opportunities for liquid biopsies and we will further develop our leadership position in this area, yet it may take some time to see the technology become more standardized in clinical diagnostics and that will require more studies just like these. I’m now on slide nine for an update on the progress in bioinformatics. On this slide you see that our offerings are set to further drive clinical NGS adoption and to push barriers of data analysis. The QIAGEN Clinical Insight platform continues to build great momentum. This evidence-based clinical decision support solution is designed for clinical labs to analyze somatic and hereditary cancer panel tests. Another of the highlights was the launch of a new end-to-end hereditary disease solution for labs to accelerate their solve rates in diagnostic odyssey cases. These are cases that involve patients who have to go from doctor to doctor searching for a solution to the health issue and it often involves a rare disease. Our team showed data at the American Society for Human Genetics explaining how labs using this new hereditary disease solution can solve upto 99% of these cases. And the benchmarking study showed that this was not possible using other bioinformatics solutions. As these cases are clinically and emotionally incredibly challenging, these results are very exciting. Also Intel [ph] recently announced some data on a new collaboration with QIAGEN in whole-genome analysis. Together we have developed a reference architecture that is able to rapidly and efficiently process vast amounts of NGS data at a significantly lower cost and infrastructure requirement yet with a higher accuracy. The optimized service solution consisting of a CLC Genomics Server and the Biomedical Genomics Workbench has cut the required number of computer nodes by 50% compared to the current recommendation from the leading sequencing supplier. This minimizes the total cost of ownership for our customers significantly. With this, I’ll hand over to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. Good afternoon to everyone in Europe and good morning to those joining from U.S. I am now on slide 10 to begin with overview of our financial performance for the third quarter and then review our results for the first nine months of 2015. First, adjusted net sales was 2% at constant exchange rates in the third quarter which was below the target for 3% constant exchange rates. The acquisition of Enzymatics provided about 2 percentage points but the rest of the portfolio was largely stable compared to the third quarter of 2014, but this was after absorbing 3 percentage points loss to lower U.S. HPV sales and underlying business grew about 5% constant exchange rates. In the third quarter, we saw a mix of factors that included improving performances in the life science against what we have -- what we see as a temporary weakness in molecular diagnostics in part due to volatile market conditions in China, Japan and Latin America. We had also expected faster growth instrument sales which were up only 4% constant exchange rate for the quarter after solid gain in the first two quarters of 2015. Another factor was the slowdown in China where sales in the third quarter were largely flat compared to the same period of 2014. We were also impacted by macro factors you must be hearing from other companies. Furthermore, adverse currency movements created about 9 percentage points of pressure on sales in the third quarter which was more than our expectations for about 7 to 8 percentage points and led to the 7% decline to $315 million. The devaluation in China and Brazil was among factors for this outcome. Moving down the income statement, adjusted operating income declined 8% to about $78 million and adjusted operating income margin was steady at 25% of sales compared to the third quarter of 2014. We had been planning for some operating income margin gains in the quarter, but we made a decision to reinvest some of the savings coming from our efficiency programs to increase sales and marketing investment. These involve expanding the sales force and promotional activities for the latent TB test QuantiFERON, as well as increasing the sources devoted to our portfolio targeting next generation sequencing. We have also been expanding our global presence especially in emerging markets in Asia and the EMEA region and are looking to enter new geographic markets. Another area has been to step up investment in ecommerce initiatives and digital transformation designed to increase customer engagement and accelerate sales growth. In other words, we felt these investments were a worthwhile short-term trade-off given the opportunities we see to bolster sales growth. For the full year, we are now planning for an adjusted operating income margin at about 25% of sales which is the same as a 25% underlying margin last year. Keep in mind that this target is based on actual currency rates. Coming back to the third quarter, a decline in the adjusted gross margin and some incremental investments in sales and marketing were largely offset by reduced R&D investments and efficiency gain in general and administration. So, adjusted gross margin declined about 1% percentage point which was due to a mix of factor that included the change in product mix and lower capacity utilization. R&D expenses were lower as a percentage of sales, reflecting the benefits of divesting our site in Marseille, France into a new standalone company as well as more efficient overall project spending and sizing bigger sales growth opportunities. Adjusted net income was $63 million which declined at a slower 4% rate compared to operating income against a year ago period. One factor was the lower adjusted tax rate at 16% was also below our target from 19%. This is below the usual level you see and this was due to the factors in the quarter that included leveraging financial structure and our activities in various geographic locations. We also had higher interest income and lower interest expenses compare to the same period in 2014 along with the lower amount of other expenses. The share count at $237 million was in line with our 2015 target. Adjusted EPS was $0.29 per share at constant exchange rate and this was line with our target for $0.29 to $0.30. At actual rate, adjusted EPS was $0.27 as we had anticipated with our guidance.  On this slide, you also have overview of results for the first nine months of the year. Adjusted net sales grew 3% at constant exchange rate which was based on underlying growth of about 7%, absorbing about 4 percentage points of headwinds from the U.S. HPV franchise. Currency movement has been a severe this year and this lead to the swing in results showing a 5% decline to $933 million at actual rate. Adjusted operating income declined 7% to approximately $225 million U.S. in the first nine months of 2015 while the adjusted operating income margin remained at about 24% of sales. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, they were $0.81 at constant exchange rates and the result at actual rate of $0.74 shows the heavy impact of adverse currency rate so far this year. The adjusted tax rate of 18% was slightly ahead of our target at 19% while the weighted share count at 237 million was in line with our plans. Moving to slide 11, I would like to provide you with an overview of the customer classes. As noted earlier, these include contributions from Enzymatics acquisition completed in December 2014. Molecular Diagnostics sales for the third quarter were softer than seen in recent years with overall sales down 3% at constant exchange rate but they were up 3% constant exchange rate when excluding U.S. HPV sales. The latent TB test QuantiFERON continued growing at a 20% constant exchange rate pace. Personalized Healthcare sales also improved in the quarter and we did have higher revenues from Pharma company-development projects but not as high as expected. Instrument and consumable sales for the QIAsymphony automation system were also solid in the quarter but year-on-year instrument growth was much lower than rates in the first and second quarter of 2015 with the expectation of the QIAsymphony. At the same time, and this is the benefit of our ability to commercialize our portfolio to both Molecular Diagnostics and life science customers, we saw improvement in Applied Testing, Academia and Pharma customer classes. All three of this customer classes Applied Testing, Academia and Pharma delivered 6% constant exchange rate growth in the quarter with underlying expansion at mid single digit constant exchange rates supported by the first time contributions from the acquisition of Enzymatics in December 2014. As you have been hearing from other companies, we are also seeing improved customer spending patterns in the U.S. and some European markets compared to earlier in 2015 such as time remained challenging and China was weaker during the third quarter than earlier in the year. I’m now on slide 12 to review sales on a regional basis for the third quarter and the year so far in 2015. The Europe, Middle East, Africa region led the regions in the third quarter with sales up 6% constant exchange rates for both the third quarter and the first nine months. Turkey, Switzerland and the Nordic countries led the performance. Growth slowed in the Americas in Q3 mainly due to the timing of some tenders in Latin America. Excluding U.S. HPV test sales, the Americas was up 5% in the third quarter and 8% for the first nine months of 2015. Key drivers were improving life science markets as well as higher sales contributions from key areas of the molecular diagnostics portfolio. The Asia Pacific, Japan region showed a sharp slowdown for 1% constant exchange rate growth which stems in contrast to the 7% constant exchange rate sales growth for the first nine months. As mentioned earlier, we saw a challenging double-digit constant exchange rate slowdown in Japan compared to growth earlier this year and also slowdown in China; this wake on the top seven emerging markets where sales were 3% constant exchange rates in the third quarter, but were up 11% constant exchange rates for the first nine months. Moving to slide 13, here you have an update on our balance sheet and cash flow position for the first nine months of the year. Our full year target is for well above $300 million of operating cash flow compared to $288 million for the full year 2014. And this has to be seen in light of adverse currency volatility this year. So, we are seeing the improvements in our cash flow materialize that we had anticipated as a result of our efficiency efforts and this for sure in the increases for both operating cash flow and free cash flow during the first three quarters of this year. Also on this slide you see that we continue to have liquidity and a manageable net debt position which leverage at 1.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. The increase in leverage which compares to 1.1 times for the same period in 2014 was mainly been due to the $250 million we spent earlier this year to repurchase some of our convertible notes in de facto share repurchase since it's moved about 10 million shares of dilution risk. I am now on slide 14, which provides you with an overview of our full year guidance for adjusted net sales and adjusted earnings per share, both at constant exchange rates given the currency volatility seeing during the year. We continue to expect full year sales growth of about 4% at constant exchange rates. This is based on about 7 to 8 percentage points of constant exchange rate growth from our core portfolio against the final year of significant headwinds from the U.S. HPV test sales, which are expected to be about 3 to 4 percentage points. In terms of adjusted EPS, based on the results for the first nine months of $0.81 per share at constant exchange rates and our goal for about $0.35 for the fourth quarter and also at constant exchange rates we have tightened our full year target to $1.16 per share. This is within the range for 2015 we had set for $1.16 to $1.18 per share in January. Moving to slide 15, here you see our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year as well as the detailed assumptions on adjusted results. In line with our full year 2015 goals, we have set a target for about 5% total constant exchange rates sales growth in the fourth quarter. This is based on the U.S. HPV franchise creating about 2 percentage points of headwinds against approximately 7% constant exchange rate growth from the rest of the portfolio in the fourth quarter. As for currency movement, the headwinds created by the strengthening U.S. dollars began rather late in 2014, so we still anticipate an adverse impact for the fourth quarter, but this is expected to be less than the 8 to 9 percentage points seen in previous quarters. So for the first quarter and based on rates as of September 30, we expect about 5 to 6 percentage points of currency pressure on sales. Given the outlook for about 5 percentage points constant exchange rate growth, this implies that total sales will be down about 1% compared to the first quarter of 2014 at actual rates. On adjusted EPS, we expect an adverse impact of about $0.02. So, based on the target of $0.35 at constant exchange rate, this would imply about $0.33 per share at actual rates. This slide also contains adjustment assumptions for the full year and the fourth quarter. The only assumption that has been changed is adjusted tax rate on a full year basis, and this has been reduced to about 17% from the prior target at 19%. Again, this is due to our ability to leverage some financial thresholds and take advantage of the geographic distribution of our business. At the same time, we see adjusted tax rate returning to the more usual range in 2016. With that, I would like to hand back to Peer. Peer Schatz Thank you, Roland. And now on slide 16 for a summary before we move into the Q&A. Let me review what we have announced. First, our results for the first nine months of the year are in line with our full year targets which we have reaffirmed and are determined to achieve. The sales performance in the third quarter was marked by strong growth in the life sciences while molecular diagnostics faced some in part due to the timing of national tenders and also with weaker results in China and Japan. Second, we are moving ahead on initiatives to transform QIAGEN and are demonstrating success in areas with strong prospects. The benefits of these efforts will become even more apparent during 2016 as we put behind us the significant headwinds from the declining sales in the United States HPV test franchise. Indeed, this year is setting a good foundation for accelerating innovation and growth from our core portfolio. And as a last point, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for higher adjusted net sales and earnings per share at constant exchange rates along with ambitions to increase free cash flow and improve our margins but again for a result that actual rates to be adversely impacted by currencies. With that I'd like to hand back to the operator for the Q&A session. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard My first question, I was hoping you could elaborate on the weakness in China in your outlook for that region; are there specific customer classes, product lines or was the weakness more broad-based? Peer Schatz So, the weakness was primarily in the MDx area. We've seen better growth in the life sciences which is however is smaller piece of the business in China. We are not attributing this to a trend; we are just very encouraged at the moment with the uptake of QuantiFERON. We know this is a very substantial market opportunity for us in China. And so moving into 2016, we expect these growth rates to be very healthy as we've seen also in previous years. Dan Leonard And then my follow-up, Peer, could you elaborate a bit on some of the areas where you are expanding the sales force that you mentioned on a call -- you or Roland have mentioned that? Peer Schatz Sure. Well, the first area that we also highlighted in the call was the significant expansion in the QuantiFERON franchise. QuantiFERON is in the meantime a very important product group at TB but also other assays that we’re also taking forward into the U.S. and this is now in clinical trials and the regulatory activities are ongoing. In Europe, we have total products targeting the QuantiFERON franchise and they are marketed by a targeted sales force which we significantly increased. And this has shown some very good effect starting now in the third quarter. August and September were record months against the strong prior year period. And we see that there is a very strong outlook for this franchise for the period to come. In particular the United States and Europe we've seen a very good uptake of the 4G [ph] product due to some of these efforts. And we are also very encouraged by the uptake in China. So, that is an area where we have applied a specialized sales channel. Where we beefed up the sales channel is in the advanced genomics and informatics areas. These are areas that we are investing in heavily also in anticipation and broadening our activities in next generation sequencing, the portfolio that we will make available there. So, there are significant investments that we are making in preparation of faster growth while we are currently seeing the last phases of depressed top line or headwinds on the top line. And so this is what you currently see in some of the numbers. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson Peer, I'm wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on the Molecular softness. You mentioned some of that was Pharama co-development. Maybe just talk to some of the underlying issues there. Obviously some of it was geographic in China as you just mentioned but what gives you conviction that this is a transitory issue? Peer Schatz So I might have misspoken but the Pharma co-development franchise is actually one which is going to see a record year in 2016 and we’re seeing record income of new partnerships and co-development activities never been stronger results, add more these massive collaboration agreements that are these umbrellas under which have individual projects. We have 12 publicly announced such deals. So, this is really moving ahead very aggressively. Our MDx franchise, to you answer your question directly, is global and results are often based on a number of factors. One of them is the timing of tenders. And this involves different types of products within the business portfolio and also regions. What we saw in 2014 that there were number of infectious disease tenders that were related to outbreaks. And I think you will be able to see which ones they were that gave us a significant uptake. And at the same time in the third quarter and fourth quarter we had a significant delay on tenders that are probably pushed now into 2016. And hence we are seeing a softness in Q3 and Q4 that we’re partly able to compensate but are not necessarily in any way related to underline long term trends or anything beyond more temporal volatility. So the nine months 2015 trends even with these impacts excluding HPV were 8% and this underscores the overall confidence. So, our team is working hard to push up that growth rate even higher in 2016 and beyond. And this is reflects also the level of excitement we have with the portfolio that we are building and how we’re putting it together. The most important thing here is that QIAGEN has multiple different growth drivers across the portfolio and while there always will be these lumpiness, especially if you’re in national tenders, we were able to nicely mitigate that with very strong quarter in the life sciences which by the way is also seeing a very good trajectory here at the moment and we’re quite excited about some of the opportunities that we have in this area going forward. Operator Our next question comes from the line Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve Beuchaw First one is actually on HPV, so nice to see that continuing to track toward expectations for this year. Can you give us a sense for how we're thinking about the trends from here, sequential trends in HPV, particularly in the U.S. into 2016? Should we think about that as roughly flat or is there a small moderation embedded? And then maybe a broader question on HPV, I mean how did you see HPV internationally track in the quarter and how you are thinking about that going forward? Peer Schatz Well HPV is a very valuable franchise for us and one that takes us into many important discussions with customers and also governments. We unfortunately, as you all know, we discussed this many times, we’re seeing pricing pressures in the U.S. against however the ability that we have to actually maintain the market leading position, significant market leading position in United States. And the pricing impact has been brutal, frankly. It's been far, far in excess of what anyone would have expected. Our market-share on the other side is far higher than I think anybody would have expected a few years ago. So, this is a different picture but a similar outcome. But the situation in U.S. will -- continues to be one which is going to see a slight negative impact on the overall numbers next year but not one that we would want to call out and make a big deal about. And hence we think this is now the last year in which this will be an impact, might be a few million dollars next year, but against the size of the overall company, this would start getting non-material. So, non-U.S. HPV was up actually double-digit in the first-half of the year. There was some lumpiness also due to some of the timings of national tenders and this was primarily now also in Latin America that we saw some weakness in the third quarter. But we expect the HPV franchise actually to be a growth contributor in 2015 even with some of the continued weakness in United States. So from that perspective - and interesting phenomenon for our discussions moving into 2016, but obviously on a very, very small revenue base now in the meantime 3, 4 percentage points including 3 percentage points U.S. on an annualize basis for this year. And it will clearly go down as a percentage of sales for the U.S. in 2015, but non-U.S. will move up and we’re seeing a lot of encouraging trends for the use of this portfolio. Operator Doug Schenkel, please go ahead, sir. Doug Schenkel So, I guess the first question is really just on operating -- the change in operating margin guidance. I think originally you guys had guided to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion, this year you’ve changed that to I believe about flat. Could you just walk through kind of the latter or the waterfall that kind of gets us there; essentially where are you investing more on and how does this change so much just late in the year? Roland Sackers I guess I tried to say on call is what we are seeing quite early actually in the quarter is that we could keep our EPS expectation for the third quarter especially because we had very good one the non-operational side, on the interest side, as well as on the tax side. And what we discussed then on the management level is that we should use these additional proceeds and invest them into especially we said also in certain marketing activity because we see here nice opportunities to even drive growth going forward. And so, at the same time, there was an active decision more or less short-term trade-off against long-term growth and that is a nice opportunity continue to drive the growth in QuantiFERON with more sales growth, more geographic expansion, same time also investing in NGS. And for example with our kind of sequence universal solution, also he bioinformatics side. And again that is all something what we believe for us good investment strategy by the same time being able to keep our guidance as it is. Doug Schenkel Okay. And Roland then I guess really Peer as well, if you look back over the last few years, EPS growth was I think 6% in 2014. And it looks like EPS growth this year is going to be well under 10%. And if we adjust for the charge you set in Q4 of last year which made the basic comparison more favorable, EPS growth this year is again going to be pretty nominal. As you just described, you are making a decision I think to increase investment from recent levels pursuant to your growth opportunities which do appear to be promising. Is this the right way to be thinking about our models heading into 2016 that we are in a prolonged period of investment? That's really the first question. And then I guess the second part would be recognizing growth this year excluding U.S. HPV, FX, M&A seem to be tracking to just over 5%. Given the investments you've made and the enhanced level of investment you're describing here, shouldn't that start to translate into some accelerations from those levels at some point soon, meaning next year? Peer Schatz Doug, I'll take the second question first and then hand over to Roland. It's interesting because I think that the summary of a lot of the things we've been saying here over the course of the last two calls, at least, is that we are clearly seeing an inflection point coming in a way that the headwinds from the HPV franchise are dissipating. And we are seeing a significant improvement coming forward towards us which is going to be the underlying growth rate that we have seen now for the past 10 quarters, which is all between 5% and 7%. So, there is a quarter with 5%; there is with times where we are at 9%; on average it was I think between around 6% to 7% -- around 6%. And this is kind of like a baseline that we are seeing. And on top of that we clearly did a lot of work to create new franchises that could have further impact on the top line. In particular the growth areas that now represent a third of our sales growing at high double digits that are increasingly impacting our overall profile of the company. So yes, our key focus is now to transition into an acceleration phase into 2016. And what you are currently seeing right now is a company that is investing to actually accelerate but still absorbing the hit on the top line, the headwind on the top line from the HPV franchise. I think what few people appreciate is that we were able to absorb that hit on the top line while reinvesting in growth engines that are now about to shine through and we are not talking now in quarters and years for this to happen but now we've made a very clear that we think 2016 is going to be substantially better simply based on the math of the headwind dissipating. So from that perspective, we are kind of in a very tight spot right now because we are investing already for a company targeting higher growth but at the same time we are still seeing like a very significant headwind which we expect to dissipate later in this year. The third quarter was clearly one where we saw some volatility on some of these national tenders. I don’t attribute anything in terms of long-term nature to this. This is just normal course of business doing business with countries. And this kind of hit us a little bit on the margin side, making the annual margin more difficult but these investments that we’re doing now, they will definitely also allow and inflection on the -- or improvement on the operating margin level to come in 2016. Roland Sackers And back to your question Doug, also just I think we have to see things in perspective. And if we adjusted for last year EPS was $1 and meeting $0.08 restructuring change, so there is 1.08 guidance for this year to know it's 1.16 on constant exchange rate side. So, what you are seeing here is there again with company overall growth rate including a significant headwind on HPV, let's say 4% for the year at the same time EPS growth rate somewhere 7% to 8%. So I think that is still something what we should do better, I could agree. But I think it’s still also something what is not bad. And assuming now what Peer was referring to that HPV headwind is moving away, growth rate going up, I think the likelihood on being also here seeing some margin improvement and that's why EPS improvements in about that level in 2016 is something what we are working hard on. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan  I wanted to ask one more on the personalized healthcare portfolio and just in the release talking about some of the slower growth trends for the companion diagnostic assays. I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color on that and whether just the level of conviction in the 4Q and beyond for that business? Peer Schatz So, personalized healthcare is a very long-term trend for us. And it is very real as you know it's a $100 million franchise for us. So, it is definitely important. I often see statements this is the potential future business for us. This is actually here today and generating profitability. It is exposed to some volatility, in particular due to anxieties around reimbursements and restructurings that are related to accommodate for that. We’ve seen continued anxiety in the United States in particular in reimbursement. And that has started to improve a little bit but it has still been more challenging than we would have thought. Certain parts of the portfolio are in good double-digit growth rates. I’d like to point out in particular the leukemia franchise where we have a market leading position and in the solid tumor area it has been a little bit more lumpy due to in particular large customers moving in various stages on that portfolio. But it is not something where I would say that there is a trend that would deviate in any way from what we see as a long-term trend in personalized healthcare and it is also a broad portfolio. So, we’re selling target sequencing panels, we’re selling next gen panels, we’re selling real-time PCR assays. And one of the impacts that we saw in the third quarter was actually softness in the prior sequencing portfolio, in the third quarter, which is one of the products that is used widely for instance also in Asia. So, there is some trends there that move in one direction and then in the next quarter the other. I wouldn’t attribute too much to that on the near-term as a franchise. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg of UBS. Please go ahead. Jon Groberg Just two quick clarifications on my questions. So one, Peer, can you just remind us as a part of your revenues, how much is the total HPV franchise, so U.S., both international as we end Q3 or what you think is going to be as we end 2015? And then just wanted to clarify in China, is the flat -- is that a local currency number or is that including currency? And then my question is, on the next GeneReader, you said you're still set for a fourth quarter -- on the GeneReader still set for the fourth quarter release. We are here in the fourth quarter, so what can we expect around announcements for that? Peer Schatz So, I’ll leave the China question to Roland. In terms of the GeneReader launch, we said it would be started here now in the fourth quarter of this year and we are -- we further confirmed that date now as we three times in the last three calls. And yes, we are nearing the end of the year. And yes, we’re still -- we’re confident that we will be launching this year. And the one thing I can promise, you’ll be the first to know. This is something that we’re clearly preparing and we want to do this right and make sure that you have all information available to also see the power of what we can bring forward. Roland, would you want to actually answer the China question? Roland Sackers Yes, China is clearly something where again we also have seen on the local basis because that is -- especially on the molecular business, especially on the instrumentation side. So I guess it is something overall what we probably see should be different in 2016. If you're just following all the discussions in China, I would say there is no mid or long-term change in direction, you will see it as something what’s I would probably call as a temporary volatility. So currency is not part of that. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Please go ahead. Matt Larew This is Matt Larew in for Brian today, just wanted to ask for bioinformatics here. Peer, if you could update us on the current size of that business? And then thoughts on the business model moving forward, particularly now that you're going to be launching GeneReader here starting in fourth quarter, how that business model evolves from here? Peer Schatz So, the revenue is attributed to the bioinformatics franchise; it’s in the range of 4% of our sales base and growing at a healthy double-digit clip. They are primarily subscription fees licensees. And this -- for use of the interpretation and then the license fees for the analytical software package is that we have. The example for instance of the Intel relationship is a nice one where we created interesting options for users of in this case [indiscernible] environment, to dramatically reduce the cost of the analytical processing of in this case holding on sequencing data. And in addition to that we have a whole suite of reagents and consumables and wherever applicable also assays including also the sample technologies that are required. So, sample technologies, sample preparation and analytics and interpretation that we are seeing as an interesting package for these customers. So, there is a direct revenue component in addition to that is the ability to create very nice packages around certain themes. And we are applying that to third party, so platform independent packages; we are also applying it to our own Sample to Insight solutions. And clearly we think this is a powerful view to take. We believe a lot of these next generation platforms -- they should become much more software centric than what they are today. It's more plumbing and the hard work that is in the focus. We think the software, what to do with the data and how to design experiments and what backwards, and what reagents to use and how to best create a workflow. It’s a real unique expertise that we have. And this is putting us in a very good position. Also one of the reasons why we're seeing good growth in the life sciences at the moment are next generation frequenting reagents and panel franchise is also been quite long. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Scott Bardo Thanks very much for taking my question…. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro Just another one on GeneReader, I think you guys have talked here about being on track for the instrumentation launch. And I'm curious to know a little bit more about the incremental investments that you think you might need to do tie together the equipment with the informatics. You obviously have a pretty broad informatics portfolio already on the market. So, I'm just trying to think through the investment for integration between the two platforms. Peer Schatz As we said some time ago, we see the integration of all of the components and the capabilities of QIAGEN is critical to be differentiating and this is something we invested in heavily over the last two years. And the ability to take every strength that QIAGEN has and to integrate it in something integrated and unique and unified is one of the value propositions that we've proven in many-many products over the history of QIAGEN. And this is -- other than it is a larger and more complex project than many, it's nothing very different. So in this case in informatics however are more important component and they have been in previous areas. And so that's why informatics is for us -- and we've always said that ever since we built this franchise which we are very proud of and which is doing very well, ever since we entered into this area, we have made it very clear that there is standalone business franchise with certain revenue base and by itself, not to justify the investment and generate a good return but in addition to that we think going forward every consumable will have instrument, everything that every service even that QIAGEN sells has its mark component around it that is benefited by having the informatics. And that’s something we hope we will also be able to show. As you’ve seen from the previous meetings, just you take the hereditary package; I went over this very quickly but every time we get feedback, we get tons of feedback from physicians or a geneticist where they say they have patients in front of them who have gone from doctor to doctor to doctor using all next-gen sequencing and all other capabilities are available to the laboratories providing services to these physicians, they have not been able to get a result. And using the informatics that we have, they not only can get cure it or diagnosis rates of 99% but they -- which is absolutely phenomenal, it sounds like a number but behind every one of these cases, there is kid, very often children, pediatric cases where you have very complex genetic diseases that previously were not solvable. And so this is just a big differentiator for us and one that we’re making available to the world but we are also making use of for our own Sample to Insight solutions. Operator Next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Scott Bardo So, just firstly, you mentioned a little bit of lumpiness, volatility in national tenders for molecular, just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit. And I understand infectious disease is quite price competitive, I wonder whether you're seeing any price pressure here or failed to get on certain tenders or whether this really is just a case of delays in anticipated tenders for which you expect to partake? I just have one follow-up after that. Peer Schatz Very valid question, Scott. I think if you look at the infection disease area, so very broad portfolio of tests. And there is an extraordinary focus typically on the United States, but we should never forget Europe which is a third of the world, and the there we have the broadest portfolio of any company currently in the market with the most flexible and advanced platforms. So -- and by the way in Europe many customers actually prefer a two-room strategy, hence the ability for us to have the cycle in one room and the sample preparation and assay set up in other. This is very often recommended and even required by public guidelines. So, we have a very good franchise there. And there the battle is typically on individual assays where somebody will come in with a competitive offering, let's say in transplantation biology and we fight that battle there, we have a strong franchise there, but then the blood virals are used to balance that out. And it's very difficult to see trends overall in individual areas. We’re clearly seeing trends and pricing move down overall in the molecular testing. They are by the way a fraction of what we have in United States. So prices are much more competitive in Europe than they are in United States. We have a very strong position in Europe and also a cost benefit in Europe. And so, I wouldn’t point to any specific assay other than this has been a trajectory which has been on for a very long time and every time there is a new assay, you can price it as a premium, it's just the old game. So there is nothing new and nothing really to look to. If you ask me for a question and answer to the lumpiness we had in the third quarter, we highlighted that there were a big infectious disease screening programs. We had good double-digit sales, if you remember last year in the infectious disease area, high double-digit sales, also QIAsymphony related. And we just didn’t have an outbreak this year in that region of the world and that was time last year in the third quarter. And these are millions of dollars typically of shipments and this year also we had a tender that basically evaporated due to administrative reason, as they always do. But this was the larger one in Q3 and Q4 and hence you have a baseline issue but at the same time this year’s numbers had an impact. Together I am not really attributing a lot -- I am much more focused right now on preparing what Doug Schenkel mentioned initially for 2016 for us to move in there with maximum momentum. And as you see from all of the numbers, we’re doing everything to prepare that while still trying everything to make sure that we meet the guidance that we set early in this year and we’re able to do that so far to the third quarter. Scott Bardo And just a quick follow-up please, just on your current pipeline, specifically GeneReader. Can you just remind us what we're likely to see at the upcoming AMP meeting and when QIAGEN will call its next Capital Market Day to set some financial targets for the company and pipeline? Peer Schatz Sure, I’ll refer to John for the Capital Markets Day discussion. AMP is an important meeting for us and I know we’ll be seeing a lot of you there next week as well. It is always an important meeting for us. It is always the meeting where molecular pathology is discussed and trends are being set going forward. And it’s a group of people that we have known for many, many years and been very closely associated with, because this is where molecular testing very often sees it through. And we will be there with a broad suite of products. Novel real-time PCR assays, the ModaPlex platform will be showing some also -- and developments on our GeneReader related portfolio. So, it's going to be really interesting to see the update and for 2016 as we all know lot of trend product at AMP in the States and we look forward to having those discussions. John Gilardi So, Scott to your question about Capital Markets Day, we’re looking at holding an event in the spring of 2016 and we’ll be putting out more information about that either later this year or early January to give you guys time and the date where we’re going to meet and give you guys an update on the business and how we’re looking forward to 2016 and then probably also about 2020. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar I had one clarification and a follow-up. So just on the guidance for ‘15, so the revenue at CER was reiterated but we're now coming in at the lower end on the EPS. Tax rate came in a little bit lighter, in light of our third quarter OpEx being pretty phenomenal, I'm just wondering what the moving part was. Is it just a conservatism or like you said, this is increased OpEx expenses related to your sales force build-out? Roland Sackers I think what we clearly see -- what we have seen in third quarter and what we have seen for -- what we expect for the fourth quarter is that we have beneficial non-operational expense situation on the interest side, on the tax side and the decision was taken by us that we invest some of this additional proceed in to sales and marketing activities to support some of the activities we referred to earlier by still maintaining the guidance. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Catherine Ramsey This is Catherine Ramsey in for Jeff, one question on instruments and then a follow-up on GeneReader. Is that kind of a older legacy instruments being soft this quarter; is there something you have in mind to fix that, product refreshes or something like that to calibrate the growth there or was it just a one quarter change it reflects? Roland Sackers We don’t see that as a significant topic for us, it is rather what we’ve seen as a Q3 development. If you look at the pipeline development for yearend but also going forward, there is nothing we are concerned. Not only the Symphony doing quite well again and also in certain areas like Europe for example, like the U.S. implementation in general was quite strong. So, it has to do a little bit with some specific situations we have seen in Japan, China and to certain extent in Latin America, again nothing what we see as a long-term trend change. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Dan Arias Maybe one on liquid biopsy, Peer, obviously a lot of activity in the market there. So, I guess as we talk through the idea of you guys investing in the important growth areas, how are you thinking about your liquid biopsy portfolio just with respect to sort of organic solutions versus building out through collaborations or acquisitions, just kind of curious about internal versus more of a business development strategy there? Peer Schatz Thanks for asking that question. It's a very confusing to understand what people are referring to when they talk about liquid biopsy. We have two ways of looking at it, number one is in terms of sample technologies meaning the collection, the stabilization, the attraction, the purification and the preparation of nucleic acids for a downstream liquid biopsy use. This is a very-very challenging step that can be done with many tools but can be done well. We think that’s an area we excel in and studies show that again and again and again. Hence our market share in this space is huge, not only in the prenatal testing area but in particular also in the cancer area where it is even more challenging sometimes. We have extremely high market share; it’s now 80% to 90% plus meaning that every time you read about these liquid biopsy applications, new labs emerging, new tests emerging, we can almost assure you that the frontend is a QIAGEN solution and that’s something were aggressively investing in and it's a top priority area for us. And we have a quite a broad portfolio in the mean time spanning cell-free DNA, spanning exosomes, spanning circulating tumor cells. The second way looking at liquid biopsy is looking at the horizontal, meaning the solution from a sample through to a report. And there in certain areas we have selectively also taken the report ourselves. We were the first to introduce the liquid biopsy companion diagnostic earlier this year that was earmarked in Europe and that is doing very well. And we are also active in many such programs, most of our pharma partners, some of them are even coming to us exactly for this capability because we have the ability to not only have the collection and extraction technique but even off the preparation and what is very important is also doing informatics, that Isaac question as well. It's very-very important to have this integral offering from Sample to Insight as we call. So this is how we look at this holistically. and some of these assays we will be taking forward ourselves as we are already doing, in particular in cancer and companion diagnostic and in many years we will partner and make our technology available to others. And this -- because of our very strong position in companion diagnostics, it is well accepted and in some cases even laboratories are giving us the ability to distribute these assays that they have developed ex-U.S. for instance which is still 50% of the world and at the same time supply them for U.S. coverage. John Gilardi Thank you, Peer. And with that question I'd like to end the call here. We've gone a bit long today. I appreciate your time and interest in QIAGEN. If you have any follow-up questions, please let me know. And for those of you going to AMP in Austin next week, please also let me know if you will be there, so that we have a chance to talk and meet in person. Thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard My first question, I was hoping you could elaborate on the weakness in China in your outlook for that region; are there specific customer classes, product lines or was the weakness more broad-based? Peer Schatz So, the weakness was primarily in the MDx area. We've seen better growth in the life sciences which is however is smaller piece of the business in China. We are not attributing this to a trend; we are just very encouraged at the moment with the uptake of QuantiFERON. We know this is a very substantial market opportunity for us in China. And so moving into 2016, we expect these growth rates to be very healthy as we've seen also in previous years. Dan Leonard And then my follow-up, Peer, could you elaborate a bit on some of the areas where you are expanding the sales force that you mentioned on a call -- you or Roland have mentioned that? Peer Schatz Sure. Well, the first area that we also highlighted in the call was the significant expansion in the QuantiFERON franchise. QuantiFERON is in the meantime a very important product group at TB but also other assays that we’re also taking forward into the U.S. and this is now in clinical trials and the regulatory activities are ongoing. In Europe, we have total products targeting the QuantiFERON franchise and they are marketed by a targeted sales force which we significantly increased. And this has shown some very good effect starting now in the third quarter. August and September were record months against the strong prior year period. And we see that there is a very strong outlook for this franchise for the period to come. In particular the United States and Europe we've seen a very good uptake of the 4G [ph] product due to some of these efforts. And we are also very encouraged by the uptake in China. So, that is an area where we have applied a specialized sales channel. Where we beefed up the sales channel is in the advanced genomics and informatics areas. These are areas that we are investing in heavily also in anticipation and broadening our activities in next generation sequencing, the portfolio that we will make available there. So, there are significant investments that we are making in preparation of faster growth while we are currently seeing the last phases of depressed top line or headwinds on the top line. And so this is what you currently see in some of the numbers. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson Peer, I'm wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on the Molecular softness. You mentioned some of that was Pharama co-development. Maybe just talk to some of the underlying issues there. Obviously some of it was geographic in China as you just mentioned but what gives you conviction that this is a transitory issue? Peer Schatz So I might have misspoken but the Pharma co-development franchise is actually one which is going to see a record year in 2016 and we’re seeing record income of new partnerships and co-development activities never been stronger results, add more these massive collaboration agreements that are these umbrellas under which have individual projects. We have 12 publicly announced such deals. So, this is really moving ahead very aggressively. Our MDx franchise, to you answer your question directly, is global and results are often based on a number of factors. One of them is the timing of tenders. And this involves different types of products within the business portfolio and also regions. What we saw in 2014 that there were number of infectious disease tenders that were related to outbreaks. And I think you will be able to see which ones they were that gave us a significant uptake. And at the same time in the third quarter and fourth quarter we had a significant delay on tenders that are probably pushed now into 2016. And hence we are seeing a softness in Q3 and Q4 that we’re partly able to compensate but are not necessarily in any way related to underline long term trends or anything beyond more temporal volatility. So the nine months 2015 trends even with these impacts excluding HPV were 8% and this underscores the overall confidence. So, our team is working hard to push up that growth rate even higher in 2016 and beyond. And this is reflects also the level of excitement we have with the portfolio that we are building and how we’re putting it together. The most important thing here is that QIAGEN has multiple different growth drivers across the portfolio and while there always will be these lumpiness, especially if you’re in national tenders, we were able to nicely mitigate that with very strong quarter in the life sciences which by the way is also seeing a very good trajectory here at the moment and we’re quite excited about some of the opportunities that we have in this area going forward. Operator Our next question comes from the line Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve Beuchaw First one is actually on HPV, so nice to see that continuing to track toward expectations for this year. Can you give us a sense for how we're thinking about the trends from here, sequential trends in HPV, particularly in the U.S. into 2016? Should we think about that as roughly flat or is there a small moderation embedded? And then maybe a broader question on HPV, I mean how did you see HPV internationally track in the quarter and how you are thinking about that going forward? Peer Schatz Well HPV is a very valuable franchise for us and one that takes us into many important discussions with customers and also governments. We unfortunately, as you all know, we discussed this many times, we’re seeing pricing pressures in the U.S. against however the ability that we have to actually maintain the market leading position, significant market leading position in United States. And the pricing impact has been brutal, frankly. It's been far, far in excess of what anyone would have expected. Our market-share on the other side is far higher than I think anybody would have expected a few years ago. So, this is a different picture but a similar outcome. But the situation in U.S. will -- continues to be one which is going to see a slight negative impact on the overall numbers next year but not one that we would want to call out and make a big deal about. And hence we think this is now the last year in which this will be an impact, might be a few million dollars next year, but against the size of the overall company, this would start getting non-material. So, non-U.S. HPV was up actually double-digit in the first-half of the year. There was some lumpiness also due to some of the timings of national tenders and this was primarily now also in Latin America that we saw some weakness in the third quarter. But we expect the HPV franchise actually to be a growth contributor in 2015 even with some of the continued weakness in United States. So from that perspective - and interesting phenomenon for our discussions moving into 2016, but obviously on a very, very small revenue base now in the meantime 3, 4 percentage points including 3 percentage points U.S. on an annualize basis for this year. And it will clearly go down as a percentage of sales for the U.S. in 2015, but non-U.S. will move up and we’re seeing a lot of encouraging trends for the use of this portfolio. Operator Doug Schenkel, please go ahead, sir. Doug Schenkel So, I guess the first question is really just on operating -- the change in operating margin guidance. I think originally you guys had guided to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion, this year you’ve changed that to I believe about flat. Could you just walk through kind of the latter or the waterfall that kind of gets us there; essentially where are you investing more on and how does this change so much just late in the year? Roland Sackers I guess I tried to say on call is what we are seeing quite early actually in the quarter is that we could keep our EPS expectation for the third quarter especially because we had very good one the non-operational side, on the interest side, as well as on the tax side. And what we discussed then on the management level is that we should use these additional proceeds and invest them into especially we said also in certain marketing activity because we see here nice opportunities to even drive growth going forward. And so, at the same time, there was an active decision more or less short-term trade-off against long-term growth and that is a nice opportunity continue to drive the growth in QuantiFERON with more sales growth, more geographic expansion, same time also investing in NGS. And for example with our kind of sequence universal solution, also he bioinformatics side. And again that is all something what we believe for us good investment strategy by the same time being able to keep our guidance as it is. Doug Schenkel Okay. And Roland then I guess really Peer as well, if you look back over the last few years, EPS growth was I think 6% in 2014. And it looks like EPS growth this year is going to be well under 10%. And if we adjust for the charge you set in Q4 of last year which made the basic comparison more favorable, EPS growth this year is again going to be pretty nominal. As you just described, you are making a decision I think to increase investment from recent levels pursuant to your growth opportunities which do appear to be promising. Is this the right way to be thinking about our models heading into 2016 that we are in a prolonged period of investment? That's really the first question. And then I guess the second part would be recognizing growth this year excluding U.S. HPV, FX, M&A seem to be tracking to just over 5%. Given the investments you've made and the enhanced level of investment you're describing here, shouldn't that start to translate into some accelerations from those levels at some point soon, meaning next year? Peer Schatz Doug, I'll take the second question first and then hand over to Roland. It's interesting because I think that the summary of a lot of the things we've been saying here over the course of the last two calls, at least, is that we are clearly seeing an inflection point coming in a way that the headwinds from the HPV franchise are dissipating. And we are seeing a significant improvement coming forward towards us which is going to be the underlying growth rate that we have seen now for the past 10 quarters, which is all between 5% and 7%. So, there is a quarter with 5%; there is with times where we are at 9%; on average it was I think between around 6% to 7% -- around 6%. And this is kind of like a baseline that we are seeing. And on top of that we clearly did a lot of work to create new franchises that could have further impact on the top line. In particular the growth areas that now represent a third of our sales growing at high double digits that are increasingly impacting our overall profile of the company. So yes, our key focus is now to transition into an acceleration phase into 2016. And what you are currently seeing right now is a company that is investing to actually accelerate but still absorbing the hit on the top line, the headwind on the top line from the HPV franchise. I think what few people appreciate is that we were able to absorb that hit on the top line while reinvesting in growth engines that are now about to shine through and we are not talking now in quarters and years for this to happen but now we've made a very clear that we think 2016 is going to be substantially better simply based on the math of the headwind dissipating. So from that perspective, we are kind of in a very tight spot right now because we are investing already for a company targeting higher growth but at the same time we are still seeing like a very significant headwind which we expect to dissipate later in this year. The third quarter was clearly one where we saw some volatility on some of these national tenders. I don’t attribute anything in terms of long-term nature to this. This is just normal course of business doing business with countries. And this kind of hit us a little bit on the margin side, making the annual margin more difficult but these investments that we’re doing now, they will definitely also allow and inflection on the -- or improvement on the operating margin level to come in 2016. Roland Sackers And back to your question Doug, also just I think we have to see things in perspective. And if we adjusted for last year EPS was $1 and meeting $0.08 restructuring change, so there is 1.08 guidance for this year to know it's 1.16 on constant exchange rate side. So, what you are seeing here is there again with company overall growth rate including a significant headwind on HPV, let's say 4% for the year at the same time EPS growth rate somewhere 7% to 8%. So I think that is still something what we should do better, I could agree. But I think it’s still also something what is not bad. And assuming now what Peer was referring to that HPV headwind is moving away, growth rate going up, I think the likelihood on being also here seeing some margin improvement and that's why EPS improvements in about that level in 2016 is something what we are working hard on. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan  I wanted to ask one more on the personalized healthcare portfolio and just in the release talking about some of the slower growth trends for the companion diagnostic assays. I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color on that and whether just the level of conviction in the 4Q and beyond for that business? Peer Schatz So, personalized healthcare is a very long-term trend for us. And it is very real as you know it's a $100 million franchise for us. So, it is definitely important. I often see statements this is the potential future business for us. This is actually here today and generating profitability. It is exposed to some volatility, in particular due to anxieties around reimbursements and restructurings that are related to accommodate for that. We’ve seen continued anxiety in the United States in particular in reimbursement. And that has started to improve a little bit but it has still been more challenging than we would have thought. Certain parts of the portfolio are in good double-digit growth rates. I’d like to point out in particular the leukemia franchise where we have a market leading position and in the solid tumor area it has been a little bit more lumpy due to in particular large customers moving in various stages on that portfolio. But it is not something where I would say that there is a trend that would deviate in any way from what we see as a long-term trend in personalized healthcare and it is also a broad portfolio. So, we’re selling target sequencing panels, we’re selling next gen panels, we’re selling real-time PCR assays. And one of the impacts that we saw in the third quarter was actually softness in the prior sequencing portfolio, in the third quarter, which is one of the products that is used widely for instance also in Asia. So, there is some trends there that move in one direction and then in the next quarter the other. I wouldn’t attribute too much to that on the near-term as a franchise. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg of UBS. Please go ahead. Jon Groberg Just two quick clarifications on my questions. So one, Peer, can you just remind us as a part of your revenues, how much is the total HPV franchise, so U.S., both international as we end Q3 or what you think is going to be as we end 2015? And then just wanted to clarify in China, is the flat -- is that a local currency number or is that including currency? And then my question is, on the next GeneReader, you said you're still set for a fourth quarter -- on the GeneReader still set for the fourth quarter release. We are here in the fourth quarter, so what can we expect around announcements for that? Peer Schatz So, I’ll leave the China question to Roland. In terms of the GeneReader launch, we said it would be started here now in the fourth quarter of this year and we are -- we further confirmed that date now as we three times in the last three calls. And yes, we are nearing the end of the year. And yes, we’re still -- we’re confident that we will be launching this year. And the one thing I can promise, you’ll be the first to know. This is something that we’re clearly preparing and we want to do this right and make sure that you have all information available to also see the power of what we can bring forward. Roland, would you want to actually answer the China question? Roland Sackers Yes, China is clearly something where again we also have seen on the local basis because that is -- especially on the molecular business, especially on the instrumentation side. So I guess it is something overall what we probably see should be different in 2016. If you're just following all the discussions in China, I would say there is no mid or long-term change in direction, you will see it as something what’s I would probably call as a temporary volatility. So currency is not part of that. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Please go ahead. Matt Larew This is Matt Larew in for Brian today, just wanted to ask for bioinformatics here. Peer, if you could update us on the current size of that business? And then thoughts on the business model moving forward, particularly now that you're going to be launching GeneReader here starting in fourth quarter, how that business model evolves from here? Peer Schatz So, the revenue is attributed to the bioinformatics franchise; it’s in the range of 4% of our sales base and growing at a healthy double-digit clip. They are primarily subscription fees licensees. And this -- for use of the interpretation and then the license fees for the analytical software package is that we have. The example for instance of the Intel relationship is a nice one where we created interesting options for users of in this case [indiscernible] environment, to dramatically reduce the cost of the analytical processing of in this case holding on sequencing data. And in addition to that we have a whole suite of reagents and consumables and wherever applicable also assays including also the sample technologies that are required. So, sample technologies, sample preparation and analytics and interpretation that we are seeing as an interesting package for these customers. So, there is a direct revenue component in addition to that is the ability to create very nice packages around certain themes. And we are applying that to third party, so platform independent packages; we are also applying it to our own Sample to Insight solutions. And clearly we think this is a powerful view to take. We believe a lot of these next generation platforms -- they should become much more software centric than what they are today. It's more plumbing and the hard work that is in the focus. We think the software, what to do with the data and how to design experiments and what backwards, and what reagents to use and how to best create a workflow. It’s a real unique expertise that we have. And this is putting us in a very good position. Also one of the reasons why we're seeing good growth in the life sciences at the moment are next generation frequenting reagents and panel franchise is also been quite long. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Scott Bardo Thanks very much for taking my question…. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro Just another one on GeneReader, I think you guys have talked here about being on track for the instrumentation launch. And I'm curious to know a little bit more about the incremental investments that you think you might need to do tie together the equipment with the informatics. You obviously have a pretty broad informatics portfolio already on the market. So, I'm just trying to think through the investment for integration between the two platforms. Peer Schatz As we said some time ago, we see the integration of all of the components and the capabilities of QIAGEN is critical to be differentiating and this is something we invested in heavily over the last two years. And the ability to take every strength that QIAGEN has and to integrate it in something integrated and unique and unified is one of the value propositions that we've proven in many-many products over the history of QIAGEN. And this is -- other than it is a larger and more complex project than many, it's nothing very different. So in this case in informatics however are more important component and they have been in previous areas. And so that's why informatics is for us -- and we've always said that ever since we built this franchise which we are very proud of and which is doing very well, ever since we entered into this area, we have made it very clear that there is standalone business franchise with certain revenue base and by itself, not to justify the investment and generate a good return but in addition to that we think going forward every consumable will have instrument, everything that every service even that QIAGEN sells has its mark component around it that is benefited by having the informatics. And that’s something we hope we will also be able to show. As you’ve seen from the previous meetings, just you take the hereditary package; I went over this very quickly but every time we get feedback, we get tons of feedback from physicians or a geneticist where they say they have patients in front of them who have gone from doctor to doctor to doctor using all next-gen sequencing and all other capabilities are available to the laboratories providing services to these physicians, they have not been able to get a result. And using the informatics that we have, they not only can get cure it or diagnosis rates of 99% but they -- which is absolutely phenomenal, it sounds like a number but behind every one of these cases, there is kid, very often children, pediatric cases where you have very complex genetic diseases that previously were not solvable. And so this is just a big differentiator for us and one that we’re making available to the world but we are also making use of for our own Sample to Insight solutions. Operator Next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Scott Bardo So, just firstly, you mentioned a little bit of lumpiness, volatility in national tenders for molecular, just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit. And I understand infectious disease is quite price competitive, I wonder whether you're seeing any price pressure here or failed to get on certain tenders or whether this really is just a case of delays in anticipated tenders for which you expect to partake? I just have one follow-up after that. Peer Schatz Very valid question, Scott. I think if you look at the infection disease area, so very broad portfolio of tests. And there is an extraordinary focus typically on the United States, but we should never forget Europe which is a third of the world, and the there we have the broadest portfolio of any company currently in the market with the most flexible and advanced platforms. So -- and by the way in Europe many customers actually prefer a two-room strategy, hence the ability for us to have the cycle in one room and the sample preparation and assay set up in other. This is very often recommended and even required by public guidelines. So, we have a very good franchise there. And there the battle is typically on individual assays where somebody will come in with a competitive offering, let's say in transplantation biology and we fight that battle there, we have a strong franchise there, but then the blood virals are used to balance that out. And it's very difficult to see trends overall in individual areas. We’re clearly seeing trends and pricing move down overall in the molecular testing. They are by the way a fraction of what we have in United States. So prices are much more competitive in Europe than they are in United States. We have a very strong position in Europe and also a cost benefit in Europe. And so, I wouldn’t point to any specific assay other than this has been a trajectory which has been on for a very long time and every time there is a new assay, you can price it as a premium, it's just the old game. So there is nothing new and nothing really to look to. If you ask me for a question and answer to the lumpiness we had in the third quarter, we highlighted that there were a big infectious disease screening programs. We had good double-digit sales, if you remember last year in the infectious disease area, high double-digit sales, also QIAsymphony related. And we just didn’t have an outbreak this year in that region of the world and that was time last year in the third quarter. And these are millions of dollars typically of shipments and this year also we had a tender that basically evaporated due to administrative reason, as they always do. But this was the larger one in Q3 and Q4 and hence you have a baseline issue but at the same time this year’s numbers had an impact. Together I am not really attributing a lot -- I am much more focused right now on preparing what Doug Schenkel mentioned initially for 2016 for us to move in there with maximum momentum. And as you see from all of the numbers, we’re doing everything to prepare that while still trying everything to make sure that we meet the guidance that we set early in this year and we’re able to do that so far to the third quarter. Scott Bardo And just a quick follow-up please, just on your current pipeline, specifically GeneReader. Can you just remind us what we're likely to see at the upcoming AMP meeting and when QIAGEN will call its next Capital Market Day to set some financial targets for the company and pipeline? Peer Schatz Sure, I’ll refer to John for the Capital Markets Day discussion. AMP is an important meeting for us and I know we’ll be seeing a lot of you there next week as well. It is always an important meeting for us. It is always the meeting where molecular pathology is discussed and trends are being set going forward. And it’s a group of people that we have known for many, many years and been very closely associated with, because this is where molecular testing very often sees it through. And we will be there with a broad suite of products. Novel real-time PCR assays, the ModaPlex platform will be showing some also -- and developments on our GeneReader related portfolio. So, it's going to be really interesting to see the update and for 2016 as we all know lot of trend product at AMP in the States and we look forward to having those discussions. John Gilardi So, Scott to your question about Capital Markets Day, we’re looking at holding an event in the spring of 2016 and we’ll be putting out more information about that either later this year or early January to give you guys time and the date where we’re going to meet and give you guys an update on the business and how we’re looking forward to 2016 and then probably also about 2020. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar I had one clarification and a follow-up. So just on the guidance for ‘15, so the revenue at CER was reiterated but we're now coming in at the lower end on the EPS. Tax rate came in a little bit lighter, in light of our third quarter OpEx being pretty phenomenal, I'm just wondering what the moving part was. Is it just a conservatism or like you said, this is increased OpEx expenses related to your sales force build-out? Roland Sackers I think what we clearly see -- what we have seen in third quarter and what we have seen for -- what we expect for the fourth quarter is that we have beneficial non-operational expense situation on the interest side, on the tax side and the decision was taken by us that we invest some of this additional proceed in to sales and marketing activities to support some of the activities we referred to earlier by still maintaining the guidance. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Catherine Ramsey This is Catherine Ramsey in for Jeff, one question on instruments and then a follow-up on GeneReader. Is that kind of a older legacy instruments being soft this quarter; is there something you have in mind to fix that, product refreshes or something like that to calibrate the growth there or was it just a one quarter change it reflects? Roland Sackers We don’t see that as a significant topic for us, it is rather what we’ve seen as a Q3 development. If you look at the pipeline development for yearend but also going forward, there is nothing we are concerned. Not only the Symphony doing quite well again and also in certain areas like Europe for example, like the U.S. implementation in general was quite strong. So, it has to do a little bit with some specific situations we have seen in Japan, China and to certain extent in Latin America, again nothing what we see as a long-term trend change. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Dan Arias Maybe one on liquid biopsy, Peer, obviously a lot of activity in the market there. So, I guess as we talk through the idea of you guys investing in the important growth areas, how are you thinking about your liquid biopsy portfolio just with respect to sort of organic solutions versus building out through collaborations or acquisitions, just kind of curious about internal versus more of a business development strategy there? Peer Schatz Thanks for asking that question. It's a very confusing to understand what people are referring to when they talk about liquid biopsy. We have two ways of looking at it, number one is in terms of sample technologies meaning the collection, the stabilization, the attraction, the purification and the preparation of nucleic acids for a downstream liquid biopsy use. This is a very-very challenging step that can be done with many tools but can be done well. We think that’s an area we excel in and studies show that again and again and again. Hence our market share in this space is huge, not only in the prenatal testing area but in particular also in the cancer area where it is even more challenging sometimes. We have extremely high market share; it’s now 80% to 90% plus meaning that every time you read about these liquid biopsy applications, new labs emerging, new tests emerging, we can almost assure you that the frontend is a QIAGEN solution and that’s something were aggressively investing in and it's a top priority area for us. And we have a quite a broad portfolio in the mean time spanning cell-free DNA, spanning exosomes, spanning circulating tumor cells. The second way looking at liquid biopsy is looking at the horizontal, meaning the solution from a sample through to a report. And there in certain areas we have selectively also taken the report ourselves. We were the first to introduce the liquid biopsy companion diagnostic earlier this year that was earmarked in Europe and that is doing very well. And we are also active in many such programs, most of our pharma partners, some of them are even coming to us exactly for this capability because we have the ability to not only have the collection and extraction technique but even off the preparation and what is very important is also doing informatics, that Isaac question as well. It's very-very important to have this integral offering from Sample to Insight as we call. So this is how we look at this holistically. and some of these assays we will be taking forward ourselves as we are already doing, in particular in cancer and companion diagnostic and in many years we will partner and make our technology available to others. And this -- because of our very strong position in companion diagnostics, it is well accepted and in some cases even laboratories are giving us the ability to distribute these assays that they have developed ex-U.S. for instance which is still 50% of the world and at the same time supply them for U.S. coverage. John Gilardi Thank you, Peer. And with that question I'd like to end the call here. We've gone a bit long today. I appreciate your time and interest in QIAGEN. If you have any follow-up questions, please let me know. And for those of you going to AMP in Austin next week, please also let me know if you will be there, so that we have a chance to talk and meet in person. Thank you very much.

Our speakers today are Peer Schatz, the Chief Executive Officer of QIAGEN; and Roland Sackers, the Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us today on the call is Dr. Sarah Fakih who joined our IR team and has previously worked in R&D at QIAGEN. On slide two, you see the customary Safe Harbor statement explaining that the discussion and the responses to your questions on this call reflect management's views as of today, February 3, 2016. We will be making statements and providing responses to your questions that state our intentions, beliefs, expectations, predictions of the future, and these constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of Safe Harbor provisions. These can involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. QIAGEN disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Also during the call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. You can find a reconciliation of these figures to the GAAP measures in the press release and the presentation for this call. As the last point, we are planning to hold a series of events this year to give you the opportunity to learn more about QIAGEN, and we will keep you updated as we schedule them during the year. With that, I would like to now hand over to Peer. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Yeah. Thank you, John, and I would like to welcome you all to this conference call. QIAGEN made significant progress during 2015 on initiatives to accelerate innovation and growth, and we believe these efforts will become more apparent in 2016 and the coming years. However, as you know, and as we announced early January, our performance in the fourth quarter was disappointing with a shortfall against expectations for faster sales and earnings growth, and this weighed on the full year results for 2015. As we move into the new year, QIAGEN remains well-positioned to benefit from the advances our teams made in 2015, and we are on a course to accelerate growth. The ambition we have set for 2016 is to double our adjusted net sales growth to about 6% at constant exchange rates compared to 3% in 2015. This growth is expected to come from the expansion of our differentiated portfolio of molecular testing solutions and also due to lessening headwinds from the ongoing decline in U.S. HPV test sales, given that they represented only 3% of total sales in 2015. So let me go through the key messages. First, our results for the fourth quarter and full year were in line with our preliminary announcement on January 10. For the fourth quarter, adjusted net sales rose 3% at constant exchange rates and this was below our outlook for 5% growth. At actual rates, sales declined 3% to about $349 million due to six percentage points of adverse currency movements. Consumables and related revenues grew 5% on a constant exchange rate basis, but the performance was hampered primarily by volatility in the timing of service revenues from our growing companion diagnostic partnership portfolio. Another factor was that instrument sales declined 4% at constant exchange rates. Adjusted EPS was $0.33 at constant exchange rates and $0.31 at actual rates. This compares to $0.25 per share in the year-ago quarter, which included a primarily noncash restructuring charge of $0.08. For the full year, adjusted net sales rose 3% at constant exchange rates, but were down 5% at actual rates to about $1.28 billion, and this was due to eight percentage points of adverse currency movements. Adjusted diluted EPS were $1.13 per share at constant exchange rates and they were $1.05 at actual rates due to the adverse currency impact. I also want to note the improvements in free cash flow, which rose 9% to $220 million. Second, we are moving ahead with our transformation to accelerate growth. Our performance over the last few years has been marked by the sharp impact of declining revenues of HPV tests in the U.S., which created three percentage points of headwind to reduce the solid 6% constant exchange rate growth performance from the rest of the portfolio. This issue has overshadowed in particular the progress of our growth drivers, as they provided about one-third of total sales and grew at a double-digit constant exchange rate pace in 2015. Our strategy is to leverage QIAGEN's leadership in providing molecular testing solutions that enable customers to gain valuable insights. We have built a differentiated portfolio of technologies, bioinformatics and automation solutions on the foundation of our absolute leadership in sample technologies, which are essential for the first lab step to gain access to the highest quality nucleic acids and leverage them to address the needs of customers in both the Life Sciences and Molecular Diagnostics. Third, we are setting full year targets for accelerating growth in 2016. Adjusted net sales are expected to rise about 6% on a constant exchange rate basis, with about one percentage point coming from the acquisition in late 2015 of MO BIO, a leader in sample technologies needed for microbial research, while about five percentage points are expected to come from the rest of the portfolio. This outlook also includes the expectation for about one percentage point of headwind from declining U.S. HPV sales. I'm now on slide five to review the progress of our growth drivers and key catalysts for 2015. In our core area of sample technologies, we continue to invest and expand our strong market and technology leadership in areas such as liquid biopsy. This is an area that QIAGEN was involved in actually creating about 15 years to 20 years ago. QIAGEN remains the only supplier covering all the key liquid biopsy targets for free-circulating DNA, exosomes, and circulating tumor cells. Sales for the QuantiFERON-TB test continued at a 20% constant exchange rate growth pace in 2015, and this means about $115 million at actual rates compared to about $100 million in 2014. The rollout of the GeneReader NGS System is building momentum thanks to very positive customer feedback following the launch at the Association for Molecular Pathology meeting in November. In Personalized Healthcare, one of the achievements was reaching our 15th master collaboration agreement with a pharma company. We are successfully expanding our portfolio of projects for many different drug candidates in both oncology and other areas. Another achievement was gaining a CE-IVD marking for the first molecular liquid biopsy companion diagnostic, which was for IRESSA from AstraZeneca for use in lung cancer patients. With the QIAsymphony automation platform, we reached more than 1,500 cumulative total placements. We introduced seven new CE-IVD tests during the year, and in Applied Testing we launched the first new assay in July for use in our human ID forensics area in the United States in more than 20 years. In bioinformatics, we had some important new product launches along with double-digit constant exchange rate sales growth. These launches included QIAGEN Clinical Insight as a reliable decision support tool for next-generation sequencing testing services. Our teams also expanded the offering of genomic analysis solutions within the CLC portfolio for microbial analysis and metagenomics. Moving to the next slide, here you see an overview of our growth drivers and key catalysts for 2016 to track our progress. Our 2016 goals include increasing the number of cumulative QIAsymphony placements to now more than 1,750 units by the end of the year, and we are seeking to further broaden the test menu. We also want to expand the number of pharma companies working with QIAGEN on companion diagnostic projects and another ambition is to keep up the double-digit constant exchange rate growth in bioinformatics by ramping up the commercialization of new products that we launched in 2015. I'm now on slide seven to review our acquisition of MO BIO, which was completed in late 2015 and complements our sample technologies portfolio. MO BIO is recognized as a top partner for labs to gain access to nucleic acids from very difficult samples, such as soil, plants, wastewater, and stool samples. These kits are essential for metagenomics, which is one of the most attractive areas of life sciences funding and involves the processing and analysis of complex microbial content such as in the human gut or the environment. On this slide you see Dr. Chris Mason from the Weill Cornell Medical College, who is a key opinion leader in this space, using MO BIO kits to collect samples. His findings about the diversity of pathogens in the New York City subway system certainly created headlines. The topic of microbiomes is now quickly moving into clinical healthcare. The reason is that understanding that microbial diversity of humans is increasingly important for clinical decision-making, in particular how it can have an impact on drug efficacy and safety. We are in the process of integrating these MO BIO products into our global commercial organization and this will significantly increase MO BIO's reach. In addition, we recently launched a whole range of products targeting microbiome analysis and our Sample to Insight solution spanning from sample technologies, panels, library preparation solutions, sequencing and PCR products, as well as powerful bioinformatics and now we can put together these different components and products into complete Sample to Insight solutions. I'm now on slide eight for an update on QuantiFERON, our latent TB test that is setting new standards for the detection of this potentially deadly infection. Two recent events underscore the threat of TB and the role of QuantiFERON-TB in the fight against this disease. A study just published in January in the American Thoracic Society's American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine found that the tuberculin test failed to accurately diagnose TB in up to 50% of pregnant women who were HIV-positive. This was the first study to compare the accuracy of the skin test against QuantiFERON-TB in this patient group and also the first to examine the impact of TB on pregnancy. While a healthy functioning immune system can keep a latent TB infection in check, pregnancy and HIV infection both compromise the immune system and increase the risk of developing active TB. So there is a critical need to improve diagnosis, and QuantiFERON-TB provides a powerful high-quality solution. The risk of active TB has to be seen in the context of World Health Organization estimates that about 16 million women worldwide are considered to be HIV-positive. The authors of the study noted that over-reliance on skin tests means health authorities are failing to detect and treat a potentially life-threatening infection in tens of millions of high-risk women. Indeed, the results show, the rate of finding positive TB infections was three times higher with the QuantiFERON-TB test compared to a skin test. We are in discussions with government health authorities in countries with a high rate of HIV infections to improve screening of pregnant women in this risk group. We also saw strong growth in Europe during 2015. As you know, we are facing an unprecedented refugee crisis. This is prompting governments to step up TB screening, such as in the United Kingdom, where we secured a very high share of the national tender and have begun shipments to our local customers. In Germany, the national TB committee also recently recommended that public health services use the modern interferon-gamma release assays to screen at-risk children for TB due to significant shortages of components for the skin test. As a last point, we are seeing good uptake of the fourth generation version of QuantiFERON-TB, which received CE marking and is being prepared for U.S. regulatory submission in 2016. I'm now on slide nine to review the GeneReader NGS system, which marks our entry into targeted segments of the benchtop sequencing market. The customer feedback has so far exceeded our expectations. What customers like the most is that we are not talking about an instrument; we are not solely promoting tech specs. Instead, we are engaged in discussions about offering them a complete and reliable solution that can generate actionable insights while providing transparency about cost. GeneReader addresses significant and previously unmet needs. This is a truly complete end-to-end system with the ability to generate reports of actionable insights, a flexible and scalable system that allows labs to do the workflow as the samples come in and not when the machine says it is ready or has enough samples for a run. QIAGEN is also seen as a reliable service partner. And above all, we are offering a commercial model designed to match the way they run their business. We call this a Price-per-Insight model. It triggers a payment to us when a report has been generated, and systems are placed on multi-year contracts. Customers have also quickly realized the power of this system and its capacity for up to 5,000 gene panels per year. We see the following types of customers having interest in the system, and these are: First, NGS experts who may add the GeneReader to the lab to better handle high sample throughput and flexible workflow demands; two, existing NGS users who may consider an instrument swap-out to reduce workflow and vendor complexity. Few people actually realize that a typical next-generation sequencing workflow involves a dozen or more vendors. QIAGEN however, can serve as the sole partner offering Sample to Insight solutions; three, labs currently in a decision making process to bring in next-generation sequencing and will now assess GeneReader; and four, labs previously resistant to next-generation sequencing that will now consider it, thanks to the benefits of GeneReader. The next-generation sequencing landscape is very diverse. Some research labs may want to focus on pure sequencing horsepower and technology breakthroughs when making their purchasing decisions. At the same time, many labs are focusing on different factors, and these are the customers we're trying to address. I'm now on slide ten, and here you see our GeneReader roadmap. Our top priority in 2016 is to develop this market opportunity and secure system placements. Keep in mind that the placement process involves often a sales cycle of about six months to nine months and this is why we are reluctant to provide sales or placement targets for 2016. However, our goal is clearly to gain a double-digit share in the benchtop sequencing market for targeted panels. Among our objectives will be to develop the product cycle, and this involves adding more sample types to the current solutions which are targeting FFPE samples. This involves enabling the use of other sample types, including liquid biopsies as well as fresh and frozen tissue. We also intend to expand the gene panel test menu to cover other specific cancer types and will further optimize the workflow through chemistry and other technical upgrades. I'm now on slide 11 to review some of the key areas we have identified for investments during 2016 with the intention of leveraging midterm growth opportunities. We have grouped these investments into three categories. The first involves strengthening our commercialization power, in particular though the addition of more sales and marketing resources (17:06) the QuantiFERON latent TB test in the United States and Europe. Our ambition is to reach a faster annual growth rate than the current 20% and to do so on an increasing base of sales. Another area involves our decision to consolidate and expand the personalized healthcare and next-generation sequencing commercial teams in the United States, Europe and some other regions to create an even more compelling offering to customers. The addition of the GeneReader next-generation sequencing system strengthens our leadership in molecular oncology testing as the only company to offer next-generation sequencing along with PCR and Modaplex technologies. We have also identified some targeted growth areas for investment. As I just mentioned, we plan to expand our next-gen sequencing offering, both in terms of building out the GeneReader next-generation sequencing system, as well as our QIAseq portfolio of universal solutions that can run on other platforms as well. The addition of MO BIO also shows our commitment to building on our foundation in sample technologies. Moving downstream, in lab processes, we intend to further expand the test menu on our automation systems. As a last investment area, we are targeting geographic expansion opportunities. We are currently building up our activities in South Africa, which is an attractive emerging market for diagnostics and also have plans to enter Thailand. Another focus area will be the Middle East, where QIAGEN is currently rather underrepresented, and we are also looking at opportunities in Latin America beyond our current operations in Mexico and Brazil. With that, I'd like to hand over to Roland. Roland Sackers - Chief Financial Officer & Managing Director Thank you, Peer. Good afternoon to everyone in Europe and good morning to those of you joining from the U.S. I'm now on slide 12 to review our financial performance in 2015 and outlook for 2016. First, for the fourth quarter the adjusted net sales growth of 3% at constant exchange rate included two percentage points from the acquisitions of Enzymatics while the rest of the portfolio grew about one point. This was also after absorbing about one percentage point due to lower U.S. HPV sales compared to the prior-year quarter. As a result, the rest of the QIAGEN portfolio represented 97% of total sales and grew 4% constant exchange rate in the quarter. Adverse currency movements created a very strong six percentage points of headwind, so sales at actual rates declined 3% to about $349 million. Moving down the income statement, adjusted operating income rose 26% to about $90 million and the operating income margin was 26% of sales. Keep in mind, however, that the results for the fourth quarter of 2014 included restructuring charges of $25.5 million. So the adjusted operating income margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was down about one percentage point from 27% in the prior-year quarter when excluding the 2014 charges. In terms of the margin development, excluding this charge, the adjusted gross margin declined about one percentage point to 71% of sales. Excluding restructuring charges, we also had lower year-on-year R&D investments and general and administration cost in the quarter as a percentage of sales, while on the other hand we had higher sales and marketing expenses compared to the same period in 2014. Our decision to reinvest savings into targeted activities during the second half of 2015 weighted on this margin development. But we see this as a worthwhile tradeoff given the opportunities to bolster growth prospects and capture new opportunities. Also for the fourth quarter, adjusted net income was about USD $74 million while adjusted earnings per share was $0.33 at constant exchange rate. In light of the adverse currency movements, adjusted EPS at actual rates was $0.31 per share. The adjusted tax rate was 15% and the share count was 237 million and both were in line with our outlook. For the full year, the results for adjusted net sales and adjusted earnings per share were in line with the preliminary estimates. Adjusted net sales grew 3% at constant exchange rates to $1.39 billion. However, adverse currency movements were tough throughout the year and adjusted net sales at actual rates declined 5% to $1.28 billion. Adjusted operating income rose 1% to about $315 million, but taking into account the restructuring charge in 2014, adjusted operating income declined about 7%. The adjusted operating income margin was 25% of sales in 2015 and this was down about 50 basis points from the margin in 2014 when excluding the restructuring charges. The trend was similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. The adjusted gross margin declined to 71% of sales from 72% for the full year in 2014, while lower R&D and administration costs as a percentage of sales offset higher sales and marketing expenses. Again, this is excluding restructuring charges. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.13 per share at constant exchange rates, up from $1.00 per share in 2014. However, results at actual rates were $1.05 per share due to the $0.08 of adverse currency movements, and this compared to $1.00 in 2014. The adjusted tax rate was 17%, and this was in line with our outlook. Moving to slide 13, I would like to provide you with an overview of the customer classes. As noted earlier, these include contributions from the Enzymatics acquisition completed in December 2014. The acquisition of MO BIO occurred very late in 2015, so it did not have a meaningful impact. The trend during 2015 was improving sentiment in the Life Science areas of Academia, Pharma, and Applied Testing. In Academia, total net sales rose 5% for the full year at constant exchange rates on better government funding trends, particular in the U.S. and Europe. Pharma sales rose 5% constant exchange rate for the full year 2015, but this was still slower than in previous years. Sales to these customers often face volatility due to pharma industry M&A and restructuring activities. Applied Testing maintained its traditional high-single-digit constant exchange rate growth pace in 2015 with the strongest expansion in human identification and forensics, and this is expected to continue into 2016. In Molecular Diagnostics, we had mixed trends. On the one hand the underlying improvements were overshadowed by headwinds from lower U.S. HPV test sales with sales of other products to these customers rising 7% constant exchange rates for the year. As we mentioned earlier, bright spots included the ongoing 20% constant exchange rate growth pace for the QuantiFERON latent TB test and double-digit constant exchange rate growth in the sales of consumables for the QIAsymphony system, as we achieved our 2015 goal for new system placements. At the same time, sales remained soft in the fourth quarter, and this was noted in our preliminary announcement. Here we felt the impact of volatility in the timing of revenues from the companion diagnostic partnerships with pharma companies with sales up year-on-year and also in the quarter, but not as high as we had planned. The decline in instrument sales for the fourth quarter was also disappointing, and this included some impact from the timing of revenue recognition from the multi-year QIAsymphony reagent rental contracts. I'm now on slide 14 to review sales on a regional basis. In the fourth quarter, we saw improving trends across all regions. The Europe/Middle East/Africa region led the overall performance for the year with sales up 6% constant exchange rate for the year and up 7% constant exchange rate in the fourth quarter, and led by Germany and Turkey along with general improving results in other European countries. The Americas delivered 2% constant exchange rate growth for the fourth quarter, and sales for the full year were largely unchanged compared to 2014. This region had to absorb the headwinds from lower U.S. HPV test sales and regional performance was up 7% at constant exchange rates for the full year when excluding this impact. After a slowdown in the third quarter, the Asia-Pacific/Japan region returned to faster growth in the fourth quarter, rising 6% at constant exchange rates. This was in line with the full year growth rate at 7% constant exchange rate. Japan has remained a challenge, declining at a single-digit constant exchange rate for the year. At the same time, China showed improvement in the fourth quarter, and here we saw high-single-digit constant exchange rate growth on a full year basis for 2015. China was also one of the highlights among our top-seven emerging markets, which as a group rose 8% constant exchange rate for the year and represented 15% of total sales. Other top incremental contributors were Turkey, South Korea, and India, and this more than offset lower sales in Mexico and Russia. Moving to slide 15, this is an update on our balance sheet and cash flow position at the end of the year. Operating cash flow for 2015 was $318 million, an increase of 10% from $288 million in 2014. This was above our target for more than $300 million. We also had a similar increase in free cash flow for the full year to about $220 million from about $175 million in 2013. We want to maintain appropriate liquidity while using resources to strengthen the business and increase returns. Net debt remains at a manageable level with leverage at 1.6 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA at the end of 2015 compared to 1.3 times at the end of 2014. We still have about $30 million left in this third $100 million share repurchase program. We certainly view our shares as being undervalued and are considering a new repurchase program. At the same time, we continue have the bias towards targeted acquisitions as you saw with MO BIO. As announced in January, our target is for adjusted net sales of about 6% constant exchange rate growth in 2016 and we see this year as opportunity to show the power of our transformation. This outlook is based on about one percentage point of growth from the acquisition of MO BIO that was completed in late 2015 and about five percentage points from the rest of the business. Keep in mind that this includes about one percentage points of headwinds from lower sales of U.S. HPV sales. And as we announced in January, adjusted EPS is expected to grow approximately in line with sales at the constant exchange rate, and this implies a target of about $1.10 to $1.11 per share. As you know, we intend to keep investing in targeted growth opportunities and that means we have a goal for the full year to maintain the adjusted operating income margin at the 2015 level of 25% of sales. Based on currency exchange rates, we currently expect pressure for the full year results in 2016 of about three percentage point in adjusted net sales. So this implies about 3% sales growth at actual rates. In terms of the currency impact on adjusted EPS, we currently expect pressure of about $0.03 per share on adjusted diluted EPS. So this implies about $1.07 to $1.08 per share at actual rates. In our pre-announcement, we had anticipated currency headwinds of about two percentage points based on rates at that time. Since then, we have seen volatility in some currencies such as the British pound, the Australian dollar, and the Chinese renminbi. Moving to slide 17, I would like to provide some details on our outlook for 2016 as well for the first quarter and provide some details for the assumptions on adjusted results. For the first quarter, we have set a goal for adjusted net sales growth of about 2% at constant exchange rates. This is based on the mix from the current portfolio and the MO BIO acquisition. It also takes into account expectations for about two percentage point of headwinds from U.S. HPV test sales. We face a tough comparison against the strong underlying performance in the first quarter of 2015. Another reason for this guidance is our expectation for weaker trends in Japan for this quarter, which is a key quarter as it is the end of their fiscal year. We also anticipate slower trends in some emerging markets and for more modest growth in China. In terms of currency impact for the first quarter, this is expected to be about four percentage points based on rates as of February 1. On adjusted EPS, we have set a goal for about $0.19 per share to $0.20 per share at constant exchange rates and for an adverse impact of about $0.01 on results at actual rates. This slide also contains adjustments assumption for the full year and the first quarter of 2016. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be about 17%, which is the same level as in 2015 and the weighted average number of fully diluted shares is expected to remain relatively stable at about 239 million compared to 237 million in 2015. With that, I would like now hand it back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Yeah, thank you, Roland. I'm now on slide 18 for a summary before we move into Q&A. So let me review what we have announced. First, we are pleased with the progress made during 2015 to set QIAGEN on a course for accelerating growth in 2016 and the coming years, but disappointed with the shortfall in the fourth quarter that weighed on our full year performance. We delivered solid sales growth from our core business, especially the double-digit gains for growth drivers, while also putting behind us the significant headwinds from the declining U.S. HPV sales that have overshadowed our performance for the past years. Second, we are moving ahead on initiatives to transform QIAGEN and are demonstrating success in areas with dynamic mid-term and long-term growth prospects. The benefits of these efforts will become even more apparent during 2016, a year with important catalysts. These include, driving greater use of the QuantiFERON-TB test, developing market opportunities for the GeneReader NGS system, benefit from improved life sciences funding in the U.S. and other key markets, and also expanding our leadership in sample technologies with differentiated premium products such as liquid biopsies and the microbiome portfolio, which also includes MO BIO. And as a last point, we are setting full year guidance for higher adjusted net sales and earnings per share at constant exchange rates, along with ambitions to increase free cash flow and making targeted investments to secure our current business and capture new opportunities through geographic expansion in digital sales (33:47). With that, I'd like to hand back to the operator for the Q&A session. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today comes from the line of Jon Groberg of UBS. Please go ahead. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC Great. Thanks a million. Peer, can you – if you think over the last few years where HPV – U.S. HPV has been a big headwind. You've done a remarkable job in terms of keeping your margins fairly stable. And I think one of the disappointments for investors as you move into 2016 is maybe not seeing that operating leverage and earnings leverage and so forth. Can you maybe elaborate as to why we're not seeing it in 2016 and when we will see some operating leverage? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Sure. So obviously when we looked at 2016 and planning for 2016, and we tried to take a very balanced view, also considering that we are making significant target in investments in areas that are still ramping up. We made significant increases also beyond our initial expectations in the QuantiFERON resource space. So that has become a much larger commercialization engine than we originally thought, but the growth rates are also very substantial. In addition, we are quite excited about the GeneReader franchise, which initially was targeting a smaller segment, and now with the initial feedback over the last few months can go broader. So there is a broader resource base also allocated to that, which is clearly not recognizing the average sales that we see on the rest of the business per head count, because we are still in ramp up mode there. So it's really all about – and you will see from I think the numbers going forward that the majority of these investments are in the commercial engine, where we have made significant changes. And in 2016, you are probably going to see some of these investments have a higher weight versus than probably in the second half of the year and then the years thereafter show more leverage. The goal for 2016 was to show top-line flexing from the 3% to 4% now up to the 6% guidance that we gave. And for the periods then thereafter we think that the EBIT line, the bottom line will then start accelerating as well and show that leverage from the top-line pull-through, which we think will continue also based on the longevity of these growth drivers for quite some time. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks. I want to ask on two things, the – just the issues that were there in 4Q, the lumpiness in the companion diagnostics business and the lower instrument revenues. Do you expect these to linger in the first part of the year, or if some of those actually come through in the first month here? And then secondly, can you give us a little more color on the underlying growth assumptions for the divisions? I'm just trying to understand where you're really modeling an acceleration I guess from our perspective things like GeneReader, while interesting, you are only launching with one assay. It's a reagent rental model. You've got some cannibalization of therascreen, so it probably doesn't move the needle that much. So can you maybe just give a little bit color of what could really drive the accelerating growth for 2016 as well? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Well, the – I'll take the second question, Roland, if you take the first one. The second question was the – is – if you look at the trajectory of revenue growth that we had over the last few years ex the HPV headwinds, it was always fluctuating anywhere between 5% and 10% and typically somewhere between 6% and 7%. And so this is pretty much the basis that we put out now for 2016. So it's the trajectory that we've seen in the prior years, plus with the – minus the HPV headwinds. So that doesn't really imply a significant acceleration for 2016 in the guidance. It's a continuation of the current trend with now just the elimination of that headwind. On top of that there's a percentage point of MO BIO baked in there as well. So you see, I think it is – it's not in any way a change in the trends that we've seen over the past few quarters. Roland? Roland Sackers - Chief Financial Officer & Managing Director Yeah, and on the fourth quarter I think on the instrumentation side that, that is the trend what we are seeing now in more general that even outside Molecular Diagnostics customers going more and more for reagent rentals. So I don't think that is something necessarily what will change for 2016, other than already included in the guidance. On the companion diagnostics side, I would say that is something clearly that we believe a couple of things are coming back over the course of 2016, not necessarily the first quarter. Again, it's a little bit too early to say and we are rather taking a more cautious approach. Nevertheless, I would say these things probably most likely will come back over time. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director You know, if I could just add to that, Tycho, the interesting thing is, while we are seeing volatility in the service revenue income, and that was obviously the major deviation from the expectations we had in the fourth quarter, we are seeing a record inflow of new partnerships and we announced the fifteenth master collaboration agreement. And, you know, there is several programs typically within each of these pharma company partnerships. So this is, I don't know, ten times more than anybody else is running in molecular. So this has accelerated significantly in 2015 and we also see good trajectory into 2016. So the – that revenue piece, it just will remain volatile and we're trying to understand how we deal with it best. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker) Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. First question actually is the two-part question, so I guess first off is, on the refugee crisis, kind of help us think a little bit about what this could do to the QuantiFERON performance I guess in 2016. And then secondly, Peer, just curious kind of how you are sizing the desktop NGS market for targeted panels? Thanks, guys. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Sure. The QuantiFERON opportunity remains vast and the recommendations that came out from WHO and others to also expand the use of QuantiFERON, which was traditionally seen as a developed world product, now into developing countries, that was a watershed event. There was something like a religion war going on for many years; is latent TB screening better or is active TB screening better? And we clearly believe that you have to address the pool of the disease prior to it becoming something that will further contribute to the spreading of the disease, i.e. prior to becoming active. And now the first subgroups of populations, also in developing countries have been called out as segments that should be screened using latent TB tests, in particular risk groups. And that's why we're also now highlighting the HIV populations and the pregnant women segments of the market that are now targets for latent TB screening. So the developed world is still barely penetrated – it's barely double-digit penetrated as a percent of the total market. And the developing world, we are basically starting at very low points, and again, moving up into very exciting numbers and are active on many, many regional and national screening programs at the moment and studies. In terms of the GeneReader market potential, we have very clear estimates where this is, and it is highly synergistic with our therascreen and our Ipsogen portfolio. We have a very significant presence in molecular pathology. It's been a market we've been in since 20 years and have a target commercialization engine there. And that same team is commercializing the GeneReader. And also here, while there has been a big battle, is PCR better, is next-generation sequencing better, there is a place for both. And having both under one roof gives customers not a technology discussion, but a solution discussion, which we've seen very productive. The market for benchtop sequencing and targeted panels in oncology is one that we have clearly defined. These are several hundred systems a year. We'll be able to give further guidance over the course of the year with further data, plus also as we highlighted, we will be expanding the menu. We started with a targeted panel to allow a very controlled and very visible launch, but clearly we have one of the largest menu development teams in this industry, have dozens of panels for generic use already in the market and are generating substantial sales there. So the question is this; when and how do we port those over to the GeneReader into a very controlled Sample to Insight solution, which would significantly expand the market beyond there. It's the fastest growing market opportunity. We're the first clinical company in many years now to enter next-generation sequencing with a full lineup of clinical expertise and the service and support networks and customers see this as a very good development and are looking forward to getting our products. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Scott J. Bardo - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom) Yeah, thanks very much for taking my questions, Peer. Actually, two quick topics. First of all, just looking into gross margin, there's been a little bit of contraction in gross margin over the last successive quarters. Obviously you mentioned the timing of the companion diagnostic revenues, which require high gross margin. But I wonder if you can just give us a little bit of an outlook on gross margin into 2016? What are some of the positive and negative considerations, both 2016 and beyond? Second question just relates to catalysts. Thank you for just giving us an outline of the things to watch. I think one thing you didn't mention was your Capital Markets Day, which I think you were highlighting at the last update for around springtime. Just wonder if you could give us a feeling for when that will be and when you are likely to set any midterm targets. Thank you. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Excellent. So Scott, I'll ask Roland to answer the question on the gross margin and will answer the one on Capital Markets Day together with John Gilardi. So Roland, do you want to take the first one? Roland Sackers - Chief Financial Officer & Managing Director Yeah, sure. On the gross margin side – and hi Scott, it's something what we I think said also before. For 2016, we was (45:57) expect the gross margin all-in to be probably quite flattish compared to 2015, where at the same time we believe that we have some opportunities to improve gross margin beyond 2016. And one clear driver for that is opportunity on insourcing QuantiFERON. We are probably right now halfway through. It is clearly a major product for us in the meantime and most all production steps was significantly outsourced and we are insourcing significant parts now, which has clearly also a costing impact for us. So I guess that is one area. General cost mix will be more favorable as we see that molecular typically comes with a slightly better gross margin in general than other customer classes in our portfolio. So the overall mix development, for example also including bioinformatics that's having a faster growth rate are going to help us here. And again, we all know that for the last three years we had a significant headwind on the gross margin side as well, which was again out of the HPV situation in North America that this is getting now less of an topic over the course of 2016. It's clearly also good news for us over the course (47:24) of the year as well. John Gilardi - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations Scott, in terms of your question about the Capital Markets Day, we were looking at a date in spring, but we feel, due to various factors, we're going to do one later in the year. Also give us a chance to give you more color about where we are with GeneReader and some other developments, but we're going to do various events on the phone and also in person for people in the U.S. and Europe during the year as well and to complement that with a chance to meet and kind of give a wrap-up. But we'll give you more information later in the year as we progress. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Please go ahead. Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. With respect to liquid biopsy, you guys are obviously a player more on the front end. Do you guys have intentions to broaden your reach and go deeper in liquid biopsy? And if so, is that an area of focus for M&A for you for this year? And maybe you can touch on kind of this broader areas of focus for M&A as well? Thanks. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Sure. So, in liquid biopsy, you're correct to point out that we have a strong franchise in the area of sample technologies and we're expanding that and you'll see a lot over 2016 as well in that area. The presence that we have is – I think there's no company having as many touch points into liquid biopsy as we do. Almost all of these liquid biopsy companies are using our sample technologies to be able to target those rare circulating analytes or rarely present analytes. At the same time, we also pioneered the first companion diagnostic with a liquid biopsy, creating a Sample to Insight solution with the CE marking of the EGFR assay for use with IRESSA. In monitoring, you typically want to have fast results and inexpensive results and go into higher iterations. So this has proven actually to be a very interesting addition to our portfolio, which is very well received. In addition, we also announced that GeneReader will receive liquid biopsy capabilities, making a Sample to Insight solution also available for next-generation sequencing for our panel work. So it is an integral part of our portfolio, right now focusing more on the predictive and prognostic markers and, in some cases, diagnostic markers that we currently have and expanding also into the panels that partly we already have in the market today and making them liquid biopsy ready. You might have seen that at the AMP we had a session where we showed that most of our panels that we're marketing today – and this is very unique because we're the only party that has this availability, are – can be used with both solid tumor and with liquid biopsy samples. So we see the two as highly synergistic and part of a continuum of care, in particular in cancer. In terms of the M&A strategy, we'll – we are highly focused on what we have on the plate. We think we have a very attractive portfolio that we want to execute on now. We worked hard for the last three years in this transformation to reposition it. I think the Street has now started to see that the addition of the world's-leading bioinformatics portfolio – there was a very good research report showing we have over 50% share in this emerging market, the integration with unique automation, unique assay development and strong Sample to Insight integration capabilities that this is starting to show its value and we're looking forward to translate this into numbers. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good morning. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Good morning. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Two questions. So you know there – could you just give us a little bit in terms of the size of some of the growth driver markets – your (51:48) percentage of revenues you got? For example, could you size us the QuantiFERON exposure, how big of a percentage of sales is that? How big your companion diagnostics? And how big the NGS is? I'm just trying to get a better sense for modeling purposes to get a better sense of what the growth opportunities are. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Sure. Well, as Roland detailed in the call, the QuantiFERON revenue base 2015 was about $115 million. We have a – showed a 20% growth rate last year and are stepping up that growth rate in 2016. The market opportunity, as we detailed many times, we believe it is probably around $1 billion under the current recommendations. And this is just based on the existing and to-date performed skin tests and market opportunities that we think are – represent also opportunities that with a – that are feasible to convert to QuantiFERON. So it's a vast opportunity, but these markets don't snowball. They – as we've seen in other markets, they kind of convert one segment at a time. The other one is the companion diagnostic franchise, as we've detailed also previously is about $100 million in size and is also for us a growth engine that is expanding, as you see from the number of new partnerships and also the announcements that we did this year. And this will further expand with the addition of next-generation sequencing, which by itself is a growth driver that we detailed could – just is alone (53:33) – we today, even prior to the launch of GeneReader, we said a few times that we're north of $75 million in sales in 2015 and that portfolio that relates to next-generation sequences – and we're not entering into a market, we're there. We're really one of the larger players already in this market with a portfolio present in the target segment that we have, and we're now adding on to that with a complete Sample to Insight solution. So these growth opportunities are vast, as you see. Just those alone are just the tips of the iceberg. And like, most of you have written reports on all of these showing massive numbers that we're trying to be conservative on and take this into a very incremental mode. But the platform has been built, and we are now in execution mode to be able to address this. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Yeah. A question for Roland quick is, on the free cash flow, could you give a 2016 guidance number? And then how should we think about the cash-on-cash returns on some of the investments you're making? Really in light of where the stock's headed, you described it as being undervalued. How do you think about the tradeoff there between investments and buybacks? Thanks. Roland Sackers - Chief Financial Officer & Managing Director As you have seen, 2015, I think that demonstrated quite nicely our ability to grow, again, cash even much faster than net income. And again, if you see the underlying net revenue growth we had in 2015, especially with currency headwinds we had, to be able to increase cash flow by 9% to roughly $220 million free cash flow, I think, is showing our commitment to what we said I think now three years ago on our Analyst Day where we said we want to double operational cash flow over a period of, at that time, four years to five years. And I think we feel quite comfortable on that way. We do expect that also cash flow is growing faster than net income again in 2016. We clearly now also said that we growing especially in the first part of the year have larger amount of incremental investments, but at the same time we do believe that there should – that the return of these investments should come in over a reasonable time period as well. Clearly, if you set up new local offices, it takes some time to get you to a breakeven point, but nevertheless within of a 20 – 12 months to 18 months time period you are typically on a – in a reasonable scale here as well. And also the activities around QuantiFERON should be allowing us to get here some traction, because we clearly do not start here from zero. It's as Peer just said, a significant part of our business. We just see here very nice development over all of the world, allowing us to grab even a bigger market share. As we all know, the overall penetration is still very low. Again, it's probably 15% of skin tests. So also here the returns should come in quite quickly. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Please go ahead. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG (Broker) Thanks for taking my questions and two if I may. Starting off with the EBIT margin and development, I understand what is going to happen in 2016, but maybe you can give us a sense of how we should think of the EBIT margin developing beyond 2016. So the investment programs you highlighted to us, is that something we should also consider beyond 2016? And my second question would be actually a follow-up question on the instrument side. And can you potentially tell us what percentage of instruments are not placed on a reagent rental basis? And also potentially how this compares to the industry. Thank you. Roland Sackers - Chief Financial Officer & Managing Director Starting with the first question. Overall you will see already in the – over the course of 2016 an EBIT margin development. It's quite obvious that of course we start a little slower here into the year, but leaving the year is clearly a number which I would expect is already quite significantly higher compared to, again, to where we start into the year and probably also then, a good basis moving into 2017. So I would expect a EBIT ratio somewhere again in the high 20s, leaving 2016 end of the year. But beyond 2016 we are clearly very much committed in terms of margin improvement. So as we said before there's 50 basis points to 100 basis points margin improvement as a midterm goal on a yearly basis. It's still something where, again we are working towards and what we have seen here is a nice opportunity to invest into areas where we either believe that we are underrepresented in terms of market share compared to the global share QIAGEN has, therefore there's regional expansion. Or we see opportunities like QuantiFERON, like NGS, where we do believe there is also a nice opportunity to get quite soon to incremental growth and it would be just not very smart not going for that even if you're coming out of a very difficult timeframe, it doesn't help us to wait here 12 months. Again, now is the time to act and I guess that is something what we decided to do, and again, do believe that returns coming in not only in 2017 but also over the course of 2016. The second question on reagent rentals. As I said before, it's clearly something, especially on the QIAsymphony side where we have seen that's quite common around molecular diagnostic customers. It's now moving ahead of that, especially also on Applied Testing customers that we get more and more request for reagent rentals. Why? Customers like that they have matched cash flows. Lot of our customers get paid by the test, so they want to pay by the test and don't have this up-front cash-out. And so what we have seen over the last more or less two years you see a growth somewhere (01:00:26) of 30%, now again, depending a little bit on which area you are, which customer class, even the 60s plus percentage range. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning or good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. I have a two-parter related to the organic growth outlook for 2016. So point number one, if I look at the Academic and Pharmaceutical segments over the last two or three quarters, the trends there have certainly gotten a little bit better as the underlying markets are a little bit better. So are you assuming that those growth trends hold up? And then Peer, as I think back to the comment that you made about the ex HPV growth in recent quarters, it's certainly a very fair comment that the growth has been stronger. All that said, it would seem like if we're assuming that Academic and Pharma growth holds up at a level that's more similar to what we've seen over the last two or three quarters, you're giving yourself more cushion on Molecular Diagnostics and the growth there; is that correct? And if so, is that more about just taking a more conservative approach on companion diagnostics, or is there some other driver there? Thanks. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Thanks. Yeah, good comment on the academic growth. I think everybody is feeling that there is a tailwind – at least expected tailwind for 2016 now in Academia and we saw – we indeed saw a lot of improvement over the second half of the year. We've significantly restructured and reorganized that business over the last three years as well as we detailed many times and there is a very exciting also innovation pipeline that we are taking forward. And as we all know that this is extremely important for the life science and Academia market. And particularly if we look at Academia, one of the few areas that is actually growing is related to next-gen sequencing and obviously that portfolio has now received – reached a certain critical mass and there's a lot of – there are a lot of other cool things coming around that portfolio that we will hopefully see also generate revenues in 2016. So I'm actually quite positive about the Academic markets in 2016 and our ability to see some good developments there. The guidance was given out also together with the announcement that we did on January 10. We know that this is a year where we want to see also the value come through from a lot of the work that we did over the past few years and so we think it represents prudent guidance. It's ambitious in some areas; it's prudent in others, and it is our best view on what would make sense to bring forward now as guidance. I wouldn't call it aggressive. I wouldn't call it overly conservative. I think against the backdrop of everything else happening, including our situation, we thought it was the best aggregation of all of these variables. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Gunnar Romer of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gunnar Romer - Deutsche Bank AG (Broker) Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. And the first one would be with regards – can you help us understand a little bit better how you think about the phasing going into the second half of the year and potentially an exit rate into 2017, what should we think about ballpark wise? And then technically upon your companion diagnostic pipeline on – can you share anything about the potentially upcoming catalysts, just how should we think about that over the course of 2016? And then last one is just if you can remind us of your exposure to the British pound? Thank you. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Okay. Number one and three, I'll ask Roland to take. I'll take number two. The Personalized Healthcare portfolio, there are indeed quite a few catalysts for 2016 as well. Unfortunately some of them are tied to drugs where we are under confidentiality, and therefore I'll have to refer to the date where we have a PDUFA or a similar announcement that would be coming out from the pharma companies also related to our diagnostic. But there's quite a bit in the portfolio that today spans all three platforms, PCR, Modaplex and next-generation sequencing. And I'd love to share this with you; it's a really exciting pipeline, but unfortunately this is something we have under CDA. Roland? Roland Sackers - Chief Financial Officer & Managing Director Yeah. On the currency side I think you're referring to the movements we have seen over the last couple of days. And again, between the time we have given – what you have just seen just generally is of course that a couple of currencies devaluated quite largely against U.S. dollar, like the British pound to 2.3% or $12, $3; Russian ruble 8%, and Indian about 3%. So it's actually a mixed bag. Clearly Europe is – British pound or U.K. is for us a larger business, not totally the size of Germany but quite close to that. So it's clearly one of the larger business we have in Europe, but it's really the group of business bringing now the FX impact from 2 to 3 percentage points or cents. And what – the other topic you are referring to is the phasing over the year. As I said before, it's – and Peer was also alluding to in his presentation is, we started a couple of investments where some of the cost will – incremental cost will stay for the time as we are – as it also related to new hires, but there's also a larger part of cost which is rather activity-driven and therefore probably also have a much larger impact on the first part of the year than compared to the second part of the year. So you will see a ramp-up over the course of the year from the first quarter was the guidance given today into what I've said before, an EBIT adjusted margin probably in the fourth quarter in the high 20s. And that is probably also, again, the kind of phasing you should expect over the rest of the year. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I want to ask two questions, one on international HPV and then one on the companion diagnostics piece. For international HPV, I'm just curious what the expectations are for this year around growth in that business, whether it's price or volume. Any detail there would be great. And then on the companion diagnostics piece, want to focus more on the assay side what some of the trends you are seeing in the market are. I know last quarter you talked a little bit about some of the reimbursement seeing some nervousness in the market. I was wondering if you saw that dynamic change at all. Thank you. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Sure. So first question, HPV international, we are seeing volume increases and we are seeing pretty steady prices in Europe. In Asia it's a little bit a mixed bag, but also here it's a very attractive market and we've seen very good growth in Asia and it's a sizable piece. Actually the revenue growth – the revenue portion ex U.S. is now larger than the revenue portion in U.S. and so – hence this is an important question. What we have to note in Europe is that prices were always substantially lower than they were in the United States. The average price of a diagnostic is often only 50% of what it is sold for in the U.S. Prices are much lower and much more competitive in Europe than they are in the United States. And so this has already been baked in and there hasn't been a big change as we, for instance, saw in the United States over the last three years in pricing. In companion diagnostics, there has been some stabilization and a lot of institutions are clearly eating the cost of the companion diagnostic. It is still a very weird situation right now. In the U.S., obviously with the FDA approved assays, we have a lot of tailwind and institutions that are working with payers that are fully reimbursing these. And again, the FDA approvals really help. In Europe it's very spotty. It's very different country by country and payer by payer, but it has become more established and more mature, and there's less complexity and uncertainty around these things, because people have a little bit more experience. So the nervousness has been removed and people have kind of found a way to live with it in the last couple of years and increasingly also in 2015. The big question now is on the reimbursement of the next-generation sequencing panels that is obviously important for us, and we'll see what – where this will go. John Gilardi - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations So with that – Roland, would you like to jump in? Roland Sackers - Chief Financial Officer & Managing Director No. Thanks. John Gilardi - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations Okay. John Gilardi - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations With that, I'd like to end the conference call for today. If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact Sarah and me, and we look forward to seeing you in the coming weeks at various industry events. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today comes from the line of Jon Groberg of UBS. Please go ahead. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC Great. Thanks a million. Peer, can you – if you think over the last few years where HPV – U.S. HPV has been a big headwind. You've done a remarkable job in terms of keeping your margins fairly stable. And I think one of the disappointments for investors as you move into 2016 is maybe not seeing that operating leverage and earnings leverage and so forth. Can you maybe elaborate as to why we're not seeing it in 2016 and when we will see some operating leverage? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Sure. So obviously when we looked at 2016 and planning for 2016, and we tried to take a very balanced view, also considering that we are making significant target in investments in areas that are still ramping up. We made significant increases also beyond our initial expectations in the QuantiFERON resource space. So that has become a much larger commercialization engine than we originally thought, but the growth rates are also very substantial. In addition, we are quite excited about the GeneReader franchise, which initially was targeting a smaller segment, and now with the initial feedback over the last few months can go broader. So there is a broader resource base also allocated to that, which is clearly not recognizing the average sales that we see on the rest of the business per head count, because we are still in ramp up mode there. So it's really all about – and you will see from I think the numbers going forward that the majority of these investments are in the commercial engine, where we have made significant changes. And in 2016, you are probably going to see some of these investments have a higher weight versus than probably in the second half of the year and then the years thereafter show more leverage. The goal for 2016 was to show top-line flexing from the 3% to 4% now up to the 6% guidance that we gave. And for the periods then thereafter we think that the EBIT line, the bottom line will then start accelerating as well and show that leverage from the top-line pull-through, which we think will continue also based on the longevity of these growth drivers for quite some time. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks. I want to ask on two things, the – just the issues that were there in 4Q, the lumpiness in the companion diagnostics business and the lower instrument revenues. Do you expect these to linger in the first part of the year, or if some of those actually come through in the first month here? And then secondly, can you give us a little more color on the underlying growth assumptions for the divisions? I'm just trying to understand where you're really modeling an acceleration I guess from our perspective things like GeneReader, while interesting, you are only launching with one assay. It's a reagent rental model. You've got some cannibalization of therascreen, so it probably doesn't move the needle that much. So can you maybe just give a little bit color of what could really drive the accelerating growth for 2016 as well? Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Well, the – I'll take the second question, Roland, if you take the first one. The second question was the – is – if you look at the trajectory of revenue growth that we had over the last few years ex the HPV headwinds, it was always fluctuating anywhere between 5% and 10% and typically somewhere between 6% and 7%. And so this is pretty much the basis that we put out now for 2016. So it's the trajectory that we've seen in the prior years, plus with the – minus the HPV headwinds. So that doesn't really imply a significant acceleration for 2016 in the guidance. It's a continuation of the current trend with now just the elimination of that headwind. On top of that there's a percentage point of MO BIO baked in there as well. So you see, I think it is – it's not in any way a change in the trends that we've seen over the past few quarters. Roland? Roland Sackers - Chief Financial Officer & Managing Director Yeah, and on the fourth quarter I think on the instrumentation side that, that is the trend what we are seeing now in more general that even outside Molecular Diagnostics customers going more and more for reagent rentals. So I don't think that is something necessarily what will change for 2016, other than already included in the guidance. On the companion diagnostics side, I would say that is something clearly that we believe a couple of things are coming back over the course of 2016, not necessarily the first quarter. Again, it's a little bit too early to say and we are rather taking a more cautious approach. Nevertheless, I would say these things probably most likely will come back over time. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director You know, if I could just add to that, Tycho, the interesting thing is, while we are seeing volatility in the service revenue income, and that was obviously the major deviation from the expectations we had in the fourth quarter, we are seeing a record inflow of new partnerships and we announced the fifteenth master collaboration agreement. And, you know, there is several programs typically within each of these pharma company partnerships. So this is, I don't know, ten times more than anybody else is running in molecular. So this has accelerated significantly in 2015 and we also see good trajectory into 2016. So the – that revenue piece, it just will remain volatile and we're trying to understand how we deal with it best. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker) Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. First question actually is the two-part question, so I guess first off is, on the refugee crisis, kind of help us think a little bit about what this could do to the QuantiFERON performance I guess in 2016. And then secondly, Peer, just curious kind of how you are sizing the desktop NGS market for targeted panels? Thanks, guys. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Sure. The QuantiFERON opportunity remains vast and the recommendations that came out from WHO and others to also expand the use of QuantiFERON, which was traditionally seen as a developed world product, now into developing countries, that was a watershed event. There was something like a religion war going on for many years; is latent TB screening better or is active TB screening better? And we clearly believe that you have to address the pool of the disease prior to it becoming something that will further contribute to the spreading of the disease, i.e. prior to becoming active. And now the first subgroups of populations, also in developing countries have been called out as segments that should be screened using latent TB tests, in particular risk groups. And that's why we're also now highlighting the HIV populations and the pregnant women segments of the market that are now targets for latent TB screening. So the developed world is still barely penetrated – it's barely double-digit penetrated as a percent of the total market. And the developing world, we are basically starting at very low points, and again, moving up into very exciting numbers and are active on many, many regional and national screening programs at the moment and studies. In terms of the GeneReader market potential, we have very clear estimates where this is, and it is highly synergistic with our therascreen and our Ipsogen portfolio. We have a very significant presence in molecular pathology. It's been a market we've been in since 20 years and have a target commercialization engine there. And that same team is commercializing the GeneReader. And also here, while there has been a big battle, is PCR better, is next-generation sequencing better, there is a place for both. And having both under one roof gives customers not a technology discussion, but a solution discussion, which we've seen very productive. The market for benchtop sequencing and targeted panels in oncology is one that we have clearly defined. These are several hundred systems a year. We'll be able to give further guidance over the course of the year with further data, plus also as we highlighted, we will be expanding the menu. We started with a targeted panel to allow a very controlled and very visible launch, but clearly we have one of the largest menu development teams in this industry, have dozens of panels for generic use already in the market and are generating substantial sales there. So the question is this; when and how do we port those over to the GeneReader into a very controlled Sample to Insight solution, which would significantly expand the market beyond there. It's the fastest growing market opportunity. We're the first clinical company in many years now to enter next-generation sequencing with a full lineup of clinical expertise and the service and support networks and customers see this as a very good development and are looking forward to getting our products. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Scott J. Bardo - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom) Yeah, thanks very much for taking my questions, Peer. Actually, two quick topics. First of all, just looking into gross margin, there's been a little bit of contraction in gross margin over the last successive quarters. Obviously you mentioned the timing of the companion diagnostic revenues, which require high gross margin. But I wonder if you can just give us a little bit of an outlook on gross margin into 2016? What are some of the positive and negative considerations, both 2016 and beyond? Second question just relates to catalysts. Thank you for just giving us an outline of the things to watch. I think one thing you didn't mention was your Capital Markets Day, which I think you were highlighting at the last update for around springtime. Just wonder if you could give us a feeling for when that will be and when you are likely to set any midterm targets. Thank you. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Excellent. So Scott, I'll ask Roland to answer the question on the gross margin and will answer the one on Capital Markets Day together with John Gilardi. So Roland, do you want to take the first one? Roland Sackers - Chief Financial Officer & Managing Director Yeah, sure. On the gross margin side – and hi Scott, it's something what we I think said also before. For 2016, we was (45:57) expect the gross margin all-in to be probably quite flattish compared to 2015, where at the same time we believe that we have some opportunities to improve gross margin beyond 2016. And one clear driver for that is opportunity on insourcing QuantiFERON. We are probably right now halfway through. It is clearly a major product for us in the meantime and most all production steps was significantly outsourced and we are insourcing significant parts now, which has clearly also a costing impact for us. So I guess that is one area. General cost mix will be more favorable as we see that molecular typically comes with a slightly better gross margin in general than other customer classes in our portfolio. So the overall mix development, for example also including bioinformatics that's having a faster growth rate are going to help us here. And again, we all know that for the last three years we had a significant headwind on the gross margin side as well, which was again out of the HPV situation in North America that this is getting now less of an topic over the course of 2016. It's clearly also good news for us over the course (47:24) of the year as well. John Gilardi - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations Scott, in terms of your question about the Capital Markets Day, we were looking at a date in spring, but we feel, due to various factors, we're going to do one later in the year. Also give us a chance to give you more color about where we are with GeneReader and some other developments, but we're going to do various events on the phone and also in person for people in the U.S. and Europe during the year as well and to complement that with a chance to meet and kind of give a wrap-up. But we'll give you more information later in the year as we progress. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Please go ahead. Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. With respect to liquid biopsy, you guys are obviously a player more on the front end. Do you guys have intentions to broaden your reach and go deeper in liquid biopsy? And if so, is that an area of focus for M&A for you for this year? And maybe you can touch on kind of this broader areas of focus for M&A as well? Thanks. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Sure. So, in liquid biopsy, you're correct to point out that we have a strong franchise in the area of sample technologies and we're expanding that and you'll see a lot over 2016 as well in that area. The presence that we have is – I think there's no company having as many touch points into liquid biopsy as we do. Almost all of these liquid biopsy companies are using our sample technologies to be able to target those rare circulating analytes or rarely present analytes. At the same time, we also pioneered the first companion diagnostic with a liquid biopsy, creating a Sample to Insight solution with the CE marking of the EGFR assay for use with IRESSA. In monitoring, you typically want to have fast results and inexpensive results and go into higher iterations. So this has proven actually to be a very interesting addition to our portfolio, which is very well received. In addition, we also announced that GeneReader will receive liquid biopsy capabilities, making a Sample to Insight solution also available for next-generation sequencing for our panel work. So it is an integral part of our portfolio, right now focusing more on the predictive and prognostic markers and, in some cases, diagnostic markers that we currently have and expanding also into the panels that partly we already have in the market today and making them liquid biopsy ready. You might have seen that at the AMP we had a session where we showed that most of our panels that we're marketing today – and this is very unique because we're the only party that has this availability, are – can be used with both solid tumor and with liquid biopsy samples. So we see the two as highly synergistic and part of a continuum of care, in particular in cancer. In terms of the M&A strategy, we'll – we are highly focused on what we have on the plate. We think we have a very attractive portfolio that we want to execute on now. We worked hard for the last three years in this transformation to reposition it. I think the Street has now started to see that the addition of the world's-leading bioinformatics portfolio – there was a very good research report showing we have over 50% share in this emerging market, the integration with unique automation, unique assay development and strong Sample to Insight integration capabilities that this is starting to show its value and we're looking forward to translate this into numbers. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good morning. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Good morning. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Two questions. So you know there – could you just give us a little bit in terms of the size of some of the growth driver markets – your (51:48) percentage of revenues you got? For example, could you size us the QuantiFERON exposure, how big of a percentage of sales is that? How big your companion diagnostics? And how big the NGS is? I'm just trying to get a better sense for modeling purposes to get a better sense of what the growth opportunities are. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Sure. Well, as Roland detailed in the call, the QuantiFERON revenue base 2015 was about $115 million. We have a – showed a 20% growth rate last year and are stepping up that growth rate in 2016. The market opportunity, as we detailed many times, we believe it is probably around $1 billion under the current recommendations. And this is just based on the existing and to-date performed skin tests and market opportunities that we think are – represent also opportunities that with a – that are feasible to convert to QuantiFERON. So it's a vast opportunity, but these markets don't snowball. They – as we've seen in other markets, they kind of convert one segment at a time. The other one is the companion diagnostic franchise, as we've detailed also previously is about $100 million in size and is also for us a growth engine that is expanding, as you see from the number of new partnerships and also the announcements that we did this year. And this will further expand with the addition of next-generation sequencing, which by itself is a growth driver that we detailed could – just is alone (53:33) – we today, even prior to the launch of GeneReader, we said a few times that we're north of $75 million in sales in 2015 and that portfolio that relates to next-generation sequences – and we're not entering into a market, we're there. We're really one of the larger players already in this market with a portfolio present in the target segment that we have, and we're now adding on to that with a complete Sample to Insight solution. So these growth opportunities are vast, as you see. Just those alone are just the tips of the iceberg. And like, most of you have written reports on all of these showing massive numbers that we're trying to be conservative on and take this into a very incremental mode. But the platform has been built, and we are now in execution mode to be able to address this. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Yeah. A question for Roland quick is, on the free cash flow, could you give a 2016 guidance number? And then how should we think about the cash-on-cash returns on some of the investments you're making? Really in light of where the stock's headed, you described it as being undervalued. How do you think about the tradeoff there between investments and buybacks? Thanks. Roland Sackers - Chief Financial Officer & Managing Director As you have seen, 2015, I think that demonstrated quite nicely our ability to grow, again, cash even much faster than net income. And again, if you see the underlying net revenue growth we had in 2015, especially with currency headwinds we had, to be able to increase cash flow by 9% to roughly $220 million free cash flow, I think, is showing our commitment to what we said I think now three years ago on our Analyst Day where we said we want to double operational cash flow over a period of, at that time, four years to five years. And I think we feel quite comfortable on that way. We do expect that also cash flow is growing faster than net income again in 2016. We clearly now also said that we growing especially in the first part of the year have larger amount of incremental investments, but at the same time we do believe that there should – that the return of these investments should come in over a reasonable time period as well. Clearly, if you set up new local offices, it takes some time to get you to a breakeven point, but nevertheless within of a 20 – 12 months to 18 months time period you are typically on a – in a reasonable scale here as well. And also the activities around QuantiFERON should be allowing us to get here some traction, because we clearly do not start here from zero. It's as Peer just said, a significant part of our business. We just see here very nice development over all of the world, allowing us to grab even a bigger market share. As we all know, the overall penetration is still very low. Again, it's probably 15% of skin tests. So also here the returns should come in quite quickly. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Please go ahead. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG (Broker) Thanks for taking my questions and two if I may. Starting off with the EBIT margin and development, I understand what is going to happen in 2016, but maybe you can give us a sense of how we should think of the EBIT margin developing beyond 2016. So the investment programs you highlighted to us, is that something we should also consider beyond 2016? And my second question would be actually a follow-up question on the instrument side. And can you potentially tell us what percentage of instruments are not placed on a reagent rental basis? And also potentially how this compares to the industry. Thank you. Roland Sackers - Chief Financial Officer & Managing Director Starting with the first question. Overall you will see already in the – over the course of 2016 an EBIT margin development. It's quite obvious that of course we start a little slower here into the year, but leaving the year is clearly a number which I would expect is already quite significantly higher compared to, again, to where we start into the year and probably also then, a good basis moving into 2017. So I would expect a EBIT ratio somewhere again in the high 20s, leaving 2016 end of the year. But beyond 2016 we are clearly very much committed in terms of margin improvement. So as we said before there's 50 basis points to 100 basis points margin improvement as a midterm goal on a yearly basis. It's still something where, again we are working towards and what we have seen here is a nice opportunity to invest into areas where we either believe that we are underrepresented in terms of market share compared to the global share QIAGEN has, therefore there's regional expansion. Or we see opportunities like QuantiFERON, like NGS, where we do believe there is also a nice opportunity to get quite soon to incremental growth and it would be just not very smart not going for that even if you're coming out of a very difficult timeframe, it doesn't help us to wait here 12 months. Again, now is the time to act and I guess that is something what we decided to do, and again, do believe that returns coming in not only in 2017 but also over the course of 2016. The second question on reagent rentals. As I said before, it's clearly something, especially on the QIAsymphony side where we have seen that's quite common around molecular diagnostic customers. It's now moving ahead of that, especially also on Applied Testing customers that we get more and more request for reagent rentals. Why? Customers like that they have matched cash flows. Lot of our customers get paid by the test, so they want to pay by the test and don't have this up-front cash-out. And so what we have seen over the last more or less two years you see a growth somewhere (01:00:26) of 30%, now again, depending a little bit on which area you are, which customer class, even the 60s plus percentage range. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning or good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. I have a two-parter related to the organic growth outlook for 2016. So point number one, if I look at the Academic and Pharmaceutical segments over the last two or three quarters, the trends there have certainly gotten a little bit better as the underlying markets are a little bit better. So are you assuming that those growth trends hold up? And then Peer, as I think back to the comment that you made about the ex HPV growth in recent quarters, it's certainly a very fair comment that the growth has been stronger. All that said, it would seem like if we're assuming that Academic and Pharma growth holds up at a level that's more similar to what we've seen over the last two or three quarters, you're giving yourself more cushion on Molecular Diagnostics and the growth there; is that correct? And if so, is that more about just taking a more conservative approach on companion diagnostics, or is there some other driver there? Thanks. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Thanks. Yeah, good comment on the academic growth. I think everybody is feeling that there is a tailwind – at least expected tailwind for 2016 now in Academia and we saw – we indeed saw a lot of improvement over the second half of the year. We've significantly restructured and reorganized that business over the last three years as well as we detailed many times and there is a very exciting also innovation pipeline that we are taking forward. And as we all know that this is extremely important for the life science and Academia market. And particularly if we look at Academia, one of the few areas that is actually growing is related to next-gen sequencing and obviously that portfolio has now received – reached a certain critical mass and there's a lot of – there are a lot of other cool things coming around that portfolio that we will hopefully see also generate revenues in 2016. So I'm actually quite positive about the Academic markets in 2016 and our ability to see some good developments there. The guidance was given out also together with the announcement that we did on January 10. We know that this is a year where we want to see also the value come through from a lot of the work that we did over the past few years and so we think it represents prudent guidance. It's ambitious in some areas; it's prudent in others, and it is our best view on what would make sense to bring forward now as guidance. I wouldn't call it aggressive. I wouldn't call it overly conservative. I think against the backdrop of everything else happening, including our situation, we thought it was the best aggregation of all of these variables. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Gunnar Romer of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gunnar Romer - Deutsche Bank AG (Broker) Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. And the first one would be with regards – can you help us understand a little bit better how you think about the phasing going into the second half of the year and potentially an exit rate into 2017, what should we think about ballpark wise? And then technically upon your companion diagnostic pipeline on – can you share anything about the potentially upcoming catalysts, just how should we think about that over the course of 2016? And then last one is just if you can remind us of your exposure to the British pound? Thank you. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Okay. Number one and three, I'll ask Roland to take. I'll take number two. The Personalized Healthcare portfolio, there are indeed quite a few catalysts for 2016 as well. Unfortunately some of them are tied to drugs where we are under confidentiality, and therefore I'll have to refer to the date where we have a PDUFA or a similar announcement that would be coming out from the pharma companies also related to our diagnostic. But there's quite a bit in the portfolio that today spans all three platforms, PCR, Modaplex and next-generation sequencing. And I'd love to share this with you; it's a really exciting pipeline, but unfortunately this is something we have under CDA. Roland? Roland Sackers - Chief Financial Officer & Managing Director Yeah. On the currency side I think you're referring to the movements we have seen over the last couple of days. And again, between the time we have given – what you have just seen just generally is of course that a couple of currencies devaluated quite largely against U.S. dollar, like the British pound to 2.3% or $12, $3; Russian ruble 8%, and Indian about 3%. So it's actually a mixed bag. Clearly Europe is – British pound or U.K. is for us a larger business, not totally the size of Germany but quite close to that. So it's clearly one of the larger business we have in Europe, but it's really the group of business bringing now the FX impact from 2 to 3 percentage points or cents. And what – the other topic you are referring to is the phasing over the year. As I said before, it's – and Peer was also alluding to in his presentation is, we started a couple of investments where some of the cost will – incremental cost will stay for the time as we are – as it also related to new hires, but there's also a larger part of cost which is rather activity-driven and therefore probably also have a much larger impact on the first part of the year than compared to the second part of the year. So you will see a ramp-up over the course of the year from the first quarter was the guidance given today into what I've said before, an EBIT adjusted margin probably in the fourth quarter in the high 20s. And that is probably also, again, the kind of phasing you should expect over the rest of the year. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I want to ask two questions, one on international HPV and then one on the companion diagnostics piece. For international HPV, I'm just curious what the expectations are for this year around growth in that business, whether it's price or volume. Any detail there would be great. And then on the companion diagnostics piece, want to focus more on the assay side what some of the trends you are seeing in the market are. I know last quarter you talked a little bit about some of the reimbursement seeing some nervousness in the market. I was wondering if you saw that dynamic change at all. Thank you. Peer M. Schatz - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Sure. So first question, HPV international, we are seeing volume increases and we are seeing pretty steady prices in Europe. In Asia it's a little bit a mixed bag, but also here it's a very attractive market and we've seen very good growth in Asia and it's a sizable piece. Actually the revenue growth – the revenue portion ex U.S. is now larger than the revenue portion in U.S. and so – hence this is an important question. What we have to note in Europe is that prices were always substantially lower than they were in the United States. The average price of a diagnostic is often only 50% of what it is sold for in the U.S. Prices are much lower and much more competitive in Europe than they are in the United States. And so this has already been baked in and there hasn't been a big change as we, for instance, saw in the United States over the last three years in pricing. In companion diagnostics, there has been some stabilization and a lot of institutions are clearly eating the cost of the companion diagnostic. It is still a very weird situation right now. In the U.S., obviously with the FDA approved assays, we have a lot of tailwind and institutions that are working with payers that are fully reimbursing these. And again, the FDA approvals really help. In Europe it's very spotty. It's very different country by country and payer by payer, but it has become more established and more mature, and there's less complexity and uncertainty around these things, because people have a little bit more experience. So the nervousness has been removed and people have kind of found a way to live with it in the last couple of years and increasingly also in 2015. The big question now is on the reimbursement of the next-generation sequencing panels that is obviously important for us, and we'll see what – where this will go. John Gilardi - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations So with that – Roland, would you like to jump in? Roland Sackers - Chief Financial Officer & Managing Director No. Thanks. John Gilardi - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations Okay. John Gilardi - Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations With that, I'd like to end the conference call for today. If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact Sarah and me, and we look forward to seeing you in the coming weeks at various industry events. Thank you.

Peer Schatz Thank you, John, and I would like to welcome all of you to this conference call. As you saw in our press release, Qiagen is moving ahead on initiative to accelerate growth and drive further innovation in our Sample to Insight portfolio and we saw those efforts reflected in our performance for the first quarter of 2016. Let me go through the key messages. First, we achieved our targets for the first quarter. Adjusted net sales rose 2% at constant exchange rates, but they were unchanged at about $298 million at actual rates and this was due to two percentage points of currency headwinds. Instruments rebounded after a weaker performance in the fourth quarter of 2015 with now 6% growth at constant exchange rates for the first quarter. Sales from consumables and related revenues rose 2% on a constant exchange rate basis and provided about 88% of sales. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.19 at both actual and constant exchange rates, compared to $0.22 in the first quarter of last year and our results were in line with the target we had set for $0.19 to $0.20 per share at constant exchange rates. Adjusted operating income also declined in the first quarter and this was due to the expected investment. Second, we're moving ahead with our transformation. This was another quarter where you see the power of our growth drivers which now represent about 35% of sales and continue to grow at a double-digit constant exchange rate pace. Our strategy is to leverage our sample to inside portfolio and continue to build our leadership and providing a range of molecular testing solutions that enable customers to gain valuable insights. One of our advantages is the ability to leverage this portfolio across the continuum from basic research and the life sciences through to clinical care and molecular diagnostics. At the same time, our growth has been offset to some degree in recent years by declining revenues in the U.S. for HPV test, used for cervical cancer screening. For the first quarter of 2016 and as expected, we saw headwind of about two percentage points and a similar trend is anticipated for the second quarter. However, we expect the headwinds to abate in the second half of the year and to be only about one to two points on a full year basis. Third, we've announced plans for a forth $100 million share repurchase program. This is a signal of our commitment to disciplined capital allocation, which also includes targeted value creating acquisitions such as with Enzymatics and MO BIO and the public tender offer to declare Exiqon. And as a final point, we're reaffirming our full year targets for 2016. As we announced in January adjusted net sales are expected to rise about 6% on a constant exchange rate basis with about one percentage points for MO BIO and about five percentage points coming from the rest of our portfolio even when absorbing the U.S. HPV headwinds. These targets do not include contributions from the pending Exiqon acquisition. I am now on Slide 5 to review some of the achievements for the first quarter. We have a very strong position in a core area of sample technologies and the addition of MO BIO’s products fit very well and have allowed us to accelerate and broaden our Sample to Insight portfolio per microbiome and metagenomics applications. Another area of sample technologies receiving a lot of attention is liquid biopsy where QIAGEN products have already enabled hundreds of peer reviewed journal articles. In fact, a recent journal oncology article detailed how study at the Dana-Farber Cancer Center on liquid biopsy and non-small cell lung cancer patients has prompted the hospital to begin offering a liquid biopsy based test to all non-small lung cancer patients at that institution. In Personalized Healthcare, we saw single-digit growth in slightly higher revenues from our companion diagnostic partnership. One announced highlight was the announcement of a new master collaboration agreement with Mirati Therapeutics and their targeted therapy glesatinib as the first project. Our companion diagnostic will guide treatment decisions based on analysis of RNA biomarkers produced by mutation of the MET gene. Placements of the QIAsymphony automation system had a solid quarter as our teams achieved more than 50 new placements. We are on track to achieve the 2016 target for more than 1,750 cumulative placements compared to more than 1,500 at the end of 2015. I am now Slide 6 to review the progress being made with the QuantiFERON latent TB test especially with the rollout of the fourth generation QuantiFERON TB Goal Plus version that has been launched in select markets. Among the key developments to independent studies were recently presented that reaffirmed the clinical performance and value of the fourth generation test. One study in the European respiratory journal showed it had an even higher sensitivity than the tuberculin test as well as earlier QuantiFERON generations. While a study presented at ECCMID confirmed the superior performance of QuantiFERON TB Gold Plus to the tuberculin skin test and the other IGRA test in high risk dialysis patients. This is an important group that has a 10 to 25 times higher risk of contracting TB than the general population. Another important milestone was the Draft B rating recently issued by the U.S. preventive service task force which is a panel of experts in primary care that developed guidelines. This positive rating validates the existing targeted CDC guidelines for TB and will help in the implementation of more latent TB screening in the primary care setting. This is very positive as QuantiFERON will be recommended as an alternative to the skin test and will be preferred in patients who have received the BCG vaccine and also those who are unlikely to return for the second visit required for by the skin test and this can often involve half of all patients. As a last point QuantiFERON was also chosen in the National TB tenders in South Korea and Taiwan and this comes after the recent public tender win in the United Kingdom. These were very visible processes due to their size and scope. So we're very pleased that the value and the performance of our solutions were recognized. I am now on Slide 7 to give you an update on our bioinformatics and universal NGS solutions. We had some important new product launches and developments in the first quarter that have further advanced and expanded our overall offering. As a first point, QIAGEN has won a prestigious award for the second consecutive year at the recent critical assessment of Genome Interpretation or CAGI. This conference poses a series of complex challenges to assess computational methods from predicting the effects of certain genomic variations. QIAGEN was once again recognized as having the most accurate solutions for solving clinical hereditary disease cases. RNA-seq explorer is also an important new product launch that brings together ingenuity pathway analysis to COC biomedical genomics work bench and our liquid biopsy kits to analyze and interpret RNA sequencing data. We're very pleased with customer feedback to the launch of the recent American Association for Cancer Research Meeting. Furthermore, we expanded our universal NGS portfolio with the launch of more than 170 new QIAseq Targeted RNA Panels for NGS based Gene expression and profiling. These are based on a novel panel design and provide a powerful solution for RNA sequencing and analysis on any NGS sequencer; thanks to the integration of our RNA sample technologies with Ingenuity bioinformatics. Another highlight was our new collaboration with 10x Genomics that we announced at AGBT in February. We're pleased that our relationship with 10x covers both core marketing as well as product harmonization and we're seeking to ensure the optimal utility of bringing together solutions from both companies. We see significant potential for combining 10x Genomics technologies with QIAGEN's portfolio in the field of single cell analysis and also to align these technologies for use in the GeneReader NGS system to enable customers to gain access to valuable insights. As a last point, the acquisition of Exiqon would add a top player in the field of non-coding RNA, which is a heart researcher and a synergistic portfolio in RNA analysis in bioinformatics. We believe our offer will create value for the shareholders for both companies and look forward to completing this transaction during 2016. I am now Slide 8 to update on the GeneReader NGS System and the progress we're making to commercializing the truly first complete sampled insight NGS workflow. Our top priority in 2016 is to develop this opportunity and secure system placements and we're targeting to gain a double-digit share of the bench-top sequencing market for targeted panels primarily in cancer clinical research. Following the start of commercialization at the AMP Conference in November, we've seen a broad and strong response from customers to this offering and we surpassed our replacement goal for the first quarter this year. We see that GeneReader has hit the right nerve for customers in clinical research and diagnostics, who are looking for a complete and flexible solution, which provides high utility insights at attractive cost, can scale as volumes grow and is embedded within a strong service and support network that addresses the highest standards. The positive customer response has been driven by the utility robustness and reliability of our first gene panel test, the QIAact Actionable Insights Tumor Panel to further increase ease of use and reduce barriers to entry for customers new to the NGS technology we have now incorporated a set of oncology standards from Horizon Discovery of the United Kingdom addressing this previously only poorly met need in a way clinical customers we truly expect. The GeneReader NGS System is now fully compatible with Horizon standard and this achievement provides critical control data to guide and monitor overall system performance. We chose horizon cell line derived reference standards due to their clinical relevance in the widespread commercial availability. Internal quality controls are a standard component in many other technologies such as real time PCR and aligning these clinically relevant standards for the GeneReader NGS System represents an essential quality controls step and will allow to advance the use of NGS in this rapidly growing segment. Also on this slide you'll see how we're segmenting the market. This is a complete system designed to meet and manage the needs of clinical customers wanting to use the NGS technology for Gene panel analysis and this is the future of driving NGS beyond the current focus on the life sciences. Indeed our view is that many labs offering NGS are processing only about 10 samples on average per week for gene panels, but the anticipated growth in GeneReader is optimally designed to help them prepare and absorb the demand. GeneReader has significant utility for even larger and higher volume labs seeking to create high flexibility yet very robust workflows that can generate insights from actionable panels. However all of the target accounts for GeneReader NGS Systems involve labs focused on the utility of the insights. They are not willing to face the challenges of managing complex and cumbersome workflows that require a dozen or more vendors and service providers and this is especially true for those entering next generation sequencing and those who want to ensure that they can manage this technology at an acceptable cost. The positive feedback to our offering is building momentum and this is based on the attributes that we see as been unmatched by others. We're offering a truly complete workflow from the single vendor. GeneReader provides a way to generate valuable and actionable clinical insights to guide treatment decisions and we offer high system flexibility and scalability to address variable lab process demand. QIAGEN is the only company to offer a transparent and flexible pricing model what we call price per insight that is designed to meet the business meets of the labs. And clinical customers trust our global service network to support them and operating a complete NGS system along with other QIAGEN workflows in their labs. Moving to Slide 9, I would like to give you a more detailed overview of the QIAGEN GeneReader NGS System development roadmap and our ambitions for the next 12 months. We have a robust development plan that builds on the foundation of the QIAact Actionable Insights Tumor Panel. We're going to expand the content offering with new multi-gene panels and this involves creating new content to enable Actionable Insights into breast and lung cancer. For example the QIAact Breast Cancer Panel will also coverage for detection of BRCA-ness tumors. These are tumors that show molecular features which BRCA mutant tumors and may respond to similar treatment approaches. Also in development is the QIAact Multi-Gene Lung Cancer Panel, which will be launched for detection and analysis of genetic copy number variations. This panel will be complemented by a second lung cancer panel designed to detect specific gene fusions on a chromosome level. We’re also going to expand the types of samples that can be processed on GeneReader beyond the current ability to process their 50 samples. The most important will be the addition of liquid biopsy and we will also expand the system for fresh and frozen tissue samples. Updates on the bioinformatics interpretation capabilities are also planned to further improve the overall workflow. We will keep you updated on the progress and the next opportunity will be the upcoming ASCA Meeting in Chicago. I am now on Slide 10 to show you how we're making progress in bringing together the various technologies in our Sample to Insight portfolio to create more valuable integrated solutions, especially those that address hot areas of life sciences research and are bound to make their way into molecular diagnostics at the same time. Just one example are the advances being made with liquid biopsy toward becoming part of a clinical healthcare. Another hot area involves microbiome research. We’re able to drive growth in both fields based on our comprehensive sample technologies offering. We are addressing the needs of customers for even greater sensitivity for liquid biopsy applications in clinical healthcare with new products in our QIAact portfolio and we've successfully implemented technologies from MO BIO into other QIAGEN products to upgrade our offerings for use in highly demanding sample types required for microbiome applications. As I mentioned earlier, our strategy is to leverage this portfolio and continue to build our leadership and providing a range of molecular testing solutions that enable customers to gain valuable insights. The efforts we're making today in these heart research areas will translate into additional commercial opportunities in the future as we leverage the portfolio beyond the current scientific focus on basically search in the life sciences and accompany the transition into clinical care. With that, I would like to hand over to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. Good afternoon to everyone in Europe and good morning to those of you who joining from the U.S. I am now on Slide 11 to review our financial performance for the first quarter of 2016 as well as our outlook for the second quarter and for full year. As Peer mentioned earlier, we achieved our target for adjusted net sales and adjusted EPS for the quarter. The adjusted net sales growth of 2% at constant exchange rate was made up of one percentage points from the late 2015 acquisition of MO BIO while the rest of the portfolio provided the second percentage points. In line with our expectations, total constant exchange rate growth had to absorb about two percentage points of headwind from lower U.S. HPV test sales. It’s actually weighs adjusted net sales were unchanged at US$298 million based on the two points of currency headwinds. Moving down the income statement, the year-on-year decline of 21% in adjusted operating income to $53 million reflected the impact of the slower start to the year in regard to sales growth and also the investments to enhance our mid-to-long term growth prospects. As a result, the adjusted operating income margin declined to 18% of sales from 22% for the same period in 2015. As for specifics on margin development, the adjusted gross margin declined three percentage points to 70% of sales. Although this was below the trend for the adjusted gross margin in recent quarters, we continue to expect a full year level of at least 70% for 2016. The result for the third quarter of 2016 was due to a mix of factors and these included a lower gross margin from revenues related to companion diagnostic partnerships, compared to the first quarter of 2015 as well as cost to centralize some manufacturing to our European production hub in Hilden, Germany. At the same time, we saw some positive margin contributions from the growth of QuantiFERON, but we also have cost to in-source the third party manufacturing for this product to our U.S. production house in Netherlands U.S. Another factor creating margin pressure for the first quarter was our decision to step up investments in sales and marketing and this reduced adjusted operating income margin by about two percentage points. Key investment areas include significantly stepping up commercialization resources particular behind QuantiFERON-TB test that we have seen some results in U.S. as well as behind our portfolio for life science customers. Other investment areas include bolstering our e-commerce channels and expanding our presence in markets such as the Middle East and Asia. On the other hand, thanks to efficiency gains and cost containment measures, general and administration costs were lower as a percentage of sales in the quarter while the investments were slightly higher as a percentage of sales as we freed up resources to redeploy the projects such as content menu on the GeneReader NGS system. Moving further down in the income statement, adjusted earnings per share was $0.19 and this was in line with the target for $0.19 to $0.20. We had higher net interest income in the first quarter of 2016 but we also saw other income expense bringing to a positive contribution in the first quarter of 2016 due to a mix of factors. The adjusted tax rate was about 50% for the first quarter of 2016 and this was below the target for 17%. We were able to generate some incremental tax benefits during this first quarter that enabled us to expense the full year target to a range of about 16% to 17%. The weighted average shares outstanding were $237 million, which was in line with our outlook for about 238 million shares. Moving to Slide 12, I would like to provide you with an overview of the customer classes. As noted earlier, these include contributions from the acquisition of MO BIO in late 2015 and was spread across all customer classes. In Molecular Diagnostics, the mixed trends from 2015 continued into 2016. On the one hand side, we saw underlying sales growth of 6% constant exchange rate, but this was overshadowed as expected by headwinds from lower U.S. HPV test sales. As a result, total sales to this customer was 2% at constant exchange rate and provided 48% of sales. After soft sales in the fourth quarter, instrument sales rose at a double-digit constant exchange rate pace, by consumers grew at a single-digit constant exchange rate. Another topic from the first quarter was the timing of the revenue conditions from company diagnostic co-development projects and these revenues were modestly higher than the first quarter of 2015. Moving to the life science, the performance in Applied Testing was challenging as sales declined 5% constant exchange rate against the strong performance in the first quarter of 2015. Instrument sales were particularly weaker in the first quarter of 2016 and as we have said in the past, this customer class can be volatile on a quarterly basis. Our outlook remains for full year sales growth at a higher single-digit constant exchange rate and for better consumable trend. The positive area for the first quarter of 2016 involves the Pharma customer class with sales up 7% constant exchange rate for the first quarter of 2016. We see some improving demand trends with rising R&D budgets on one side, but also face adverse trends of consolidation and restructuring projects. In Academia, total net sales rose 2% for the first quarter, although the growth rate was below that's seen in the recent quarters, we anticipate a better trend during the year, in particular a mid-science of scientists in key markets taking a more positive mid-term perceptive on funding. I’m now on Slide 13 to review our sales on a geographic basis. We saw improving trends across all regions and a highlight was a top seven emerging markets rising 90% at constant exchange rates and providing 13% of total sales. The Europe, Middle East, Africa region led to overall performance with sales up 7% constant exchange rate and providing about one third of sales. The core markets of the United Kingdom, France and Germany all showed good single-digit constant exchange rate growth while Italy had weaker trends. The Molecular Diagnostics and Pharma customer classes more than overcame weaker trends in applied testing. Growth in the Americas came primarily from the United States and Mexico. In Brazil, we saw weaker growth trends in 2015 and this is something you have to ask from other companies. When you exclude U.S. HPV tests, the Americas delivered 5% constant exchange with grow for the quarter. Into Asia Pacific, Japan region, we saw two different trends. Number one, we saw a significant double-digit constant exchange rate drop in Japan, which continues to be a challenging microenvironment. However, the rest of this region grew about 15% CER. The leading countries remains China, where sales grew about 10% constant exchange rate. We also saw important contribution from South Korea, Australia and Singapore. As a last point, sales in the rest of the world were down about $2 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. Moving to Slide 14, I would like to give you an update on our balance sheet and cash flows and also some views on the news about our first $100 million share repurchase program. This new program is being initiated after it's authorization for the $700 million program recently expired. Being completed about $17 million of repurchases and debt program, we see this program as a signal of our commitment through disciplined capital deployment and we intend to continue them while also supporting the business expansion through strategically important bolt on acquisition. In terms of liquidity and leverage, the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remains stable as about 1.5 times. The new share repurchase program and the completion of Exiqon acquisition, which is expected to cost about $100 million, I’m not expected to have a material impact on leverage as we expect this outflow to be offset by cash generation. I’m now on Slide 15 to review our adjusted net sales and adjusted EPS targets for the full year. As announced in January, our target for adjusted net sales growth was about 6% constant exchange rate. This outlook is based on about one percentage point of growth from the MO BIO acquisition that was completed in late 2015 and about five percentage points from the rest of the business. As we mentioned earlier, this does not take into account the proposal to acquire Exiqon and we will provide an update once the transaction is completed. This target also includes about one percentage point of headwind from lower sales of U.S. HPV test. Moving to adjusted EPS, our guidance remains for growth largely in line with sales as a constant exchange rate and this implies about $1.10 to $1.11 per share on a full year basis for 2016. This guidance also reflects our plan to continue the pace of investments into targeted growth opportunities during the second quarter. What is interesting to note is that we're anticipating a distribution of sales between the first and second half of 2016 that is not materially different than what we had last year and that is for about 47% to 48% in the first half and about 52% to 53% in the second half. However, the expense distribution is different, and they're more weighted to the first half of 2016 than in 2015. This was due to our decision to accelerate operating expenditures, significantly faster than sales growth in this period. This involves plans such as stepped on commercialization -- stepped up commercialization initiatives, such as for GeneReader and QuantiFERON, as well as to expand our regional presence. You see about roughly half of this investment as being onetime costs. So we expect the growth in operating expenditures to be significantly slower in the second half of the year and to be lower than the sales growth rate. This is why the profit acceleration in the second half is more tied to the acceleration of expenses and cost management since the sales distribution is largely in line with previous years. Our guidance is based on constant exchange rate, but we also provide estimates of potential currency impact. Based on rates as of April 1, we expect slightly less headwinds than in January. So, in terms of adjusted net sales, we now expect pressure of about two percentage points on the full year guidance for about 6% constant exchange rate sales growth. For adjusted EPS, we now expect currency pressure of about $0.02 per share on the full year CEI guidance of about $1.10 to $1.11 per share. Moving to Slide 16, I would like to provide some more details and assumptions for our outlook for the second quarter of 2016 and the full year. For the second quarter, our target is for adjusted net sales growth of 4% at constant exchange rates. This takes into account two percentage points of headwind from declining US HPV test sales, so it’s underlying sales growth target is 6% constant exchange rate. In terms of adjusted EPS, we have set a target for about $0.22 per share at constant exchange rate and this compares to $0.26 in the second quarter of 2015. This reflects investments we discussed in our last call on which we’re making to enhanced growth and for adjust4ed earnings growth to accelerate in the second half of 2016. This slide also contains adjustment assumptions for the second quarter and the full year. As I mentioned earlier the adjusted tax rate for the second quarter is expected to be 16% and we've set a new range for the full year of 16% to 17%. With that I would like to hand back to Peer. Peer Schatz Yeah, thank you, Roland. I’m now on Slide 17 for a summary before we move into Q&A. Let me review what we have announced. First we achieved our targets for the first quarter for adjusted net sales growth at 2% constant exchange rate growth and adjusted earnings per share at $0.19 while moving ahead on initiatives to accelerate growth and drive further innovation. Second, we're moving ahead on imitative to transform QIAGEN and we're demonstrating success in areas with solid growth prospects. The benefits of these efforts will become even more apparent during 2016 a year with important catalyst. Third, we've announced our fourth $100 million share repurchase program and this is a signal of our commitment to disciplined capital allocation. We will continue to strengthen our portfolio with targeted acquisitions and look forward to completing the Exiqon transaction. And as a last point, we have reaffirmed our full year guidance for higher adjusted net sales and earnings per share at constant exchange rates as QIAGEN prepares for an even stronger performance in '17 and the coming years. With that, I’d like to hand back to the operator for the Q&A session. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Daniel Arias of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias Good morning. Can you guys hear me? Peer Schatz Yeah, good morning, Dan. How are you? Daniel Arias Okay, thanks, doing well. Roland on the expense structure, how confident are you in the budget that you have here at this point for your growth initiatives? Obviously between the GeneReader and QuantiFERON and liquid biopsy there is a good deal of market development to be done. So as you push into these opportunities, I’m just curious what the error bands look like at this point in terms of the investment levels that you’ve baked in? Roland Sackers I think we have our hands very well around our expense structures because the reason while I think we've very excellent and explained in early January this year when we give guidance and we delivered exactly what we were planning for the first quarter. If you look on the areas we decided where we invest in it's a very -- this is very focused activity we could expect and doing quite well. And if you look on the big aspect on the allocation to second slide and fourth quarter, just take first quarter one way and if you would use this as a basis for the fourth quarter assuming for the next three quarters, assuming still there is a certain pick up in the second quarter, you will see that with expected revenue increase we will do quite nicely our guidance. So I guess there is a lot of execution required and nevertheless we're very focused around that and definitely see that. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.  Bill Quirk Great, thank you, good afternoon. I've one question and a quick follow-up. So first off and this is somewhat related to Dan’s question, so Roland thinking about the plan consolidation in the first quarter, presumably this should help you in future periods, if so can you just help us think about the magnitude of that and then again I have follow-up, thanks. Roland Sackers Yeah good question, I think but what we just spelled out here in the first quarter is that we're still trying to consolidate as many production size into our larger regional hubs here in Germany as well in Maryland and the U.S. and clearly this is quite helpful for all level at the end of the day. And if you assume for a second that our gross margin in the first quarter was roughly 100 basis point below I would say average run rate of the three quarters, half of that was really one time impact. And therefore we feel quite confident that also over the next three quarters the gross margin as well as going about 70% and even the larger share in the third and fourth quarter. Bill Quirk Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just on OUS HPV it's obviously been a nice growth driver for you in the past. It looks like it slowed down here this quarter. We didn’t pick up anything in the competitive results and so I’m curious was this just a lack of tenders in the quarter or is perhaps the market slowing outside the U.S. thank you. Peer Schatz You’re absolutely right on that one that that business is a tender business typically ex-US and therefore it is little bit lumpier and you’ll see more volatility in that growth rate, but we remain incredibly well positioned competitively and are seeing competitive wins pretty much continually. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson Hey thanks, two quick ones. First on GeneReader, I am trying to understand how you’re managing the reimbursement dynamic with your customers with the $550 gene reimbursement down around $600. It seems like a lot of labs are having a hard time making the profit. So just wondering how active you are in helping with some of the reimbursement discussion? And then separately Peer, I’m trying to get a better comfort in the guidance for the year. I mean by our math and you did do about 7% to 8% organic in the back half and you’re coming off 2% in the first quarter 4% in the second quarter. So maybe just get us comfortable with what further drive that revenue reacceleration in the back half of the year? I know you do have easier comps? Peer Schatz Sure. Okay so the first question obviously we are moving through and preparing also the appropriate regulatory processes to be able to position these systems adequate, but if you look at the system and also the panel as it designed today, it’s designed for very attractive economics and we're one of the few providers who can actually provide a positive value contribution to laboratories and allow laboratories to create a profit. Once you actually take all of the components and all of the services required to do a next generation sequencing run together, this often is not one or two suppliers, but this is often more than a dozen that come together for a complete work flow. Costs are much higher than most labs normally would think and looking at price per insight model where we actually are able to integrate everything from the primary sample through the report and create a very, very reliable price per insight for that, that is actually in a range that allows a very attractive margin even under these new reduced panel rates. That is something that is driving a lot of customers to look at this and see this as a really viable option. Its different in different countries around the world, but the economics of is not really just economics of the sequencing reaction. That’s actually a small fraction of it. The majority of the economics of the cost of the work flow and various steps around the sequencing reaction upfront and downstream and we have created a fully integrated system that takes care of that. In terms of the revenue distribution I'll hand over to Roland in a minute, but I guess the one statement that he made in his comments was very important that we’re pretty much comparable in terms of the revenue distribution we’re guiding for this year to what we saw last year. The revenue distribution last year was something like 48%, 52% of full year revenue target and this year its depending on what number you use would be above 47% to 53%. So it's not really materially different and considering that we’re seeing these strong growth rates in key product areas such as QuantiFERON and others that are doing very well now moving into the second quarter we feel quite good about that revenue target. This issue with the profits accelerating in the second half of the year is not a revenue story. It is a cost management story, because we accelerated expenses in the first half that we're confidently will show a nice benefit in the second half and therefore would allow us to slow down expense growth. Operator Our question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to focus on Slide 9 with your GeneReader roadmap and appreciate, there is probably a lot of detail you don’t offer today, but I was hoping to maybe comment on two items. First was in the sample type expansion comments where you're looking at liquid biopsy does that relate specifically to liquid biopsy samples for research work or would it be actually clinical diagnostics, to liquid biopsy on GeneReader. Peer Schatz Sure, while so the liquid biopsy sample technology solutions we have today are very widely used. We're selling millions of these every year and we also have announced to the market that we are going to launch new versions that also will have clinical claims attached to them. So the GeneReader NGS system is a system targeting clinical research and diagnostics and therefore the liquid biopsy solutions that we will be bringing on to the system will be solutions that will be quarter below into into clinical work flows as well. The system as you know the frontend system, the QIAcube, is today already automating the clinical sample -- the DNA, liquid biopsy solutions that are registered with FDA and this will therefore be an integration of already of very robust and highly validated system. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan Thanks, good morning. I had two somewhat really questions with QuantiFERON, nice to see the sales force investment starting to pay off. I am curious, do you think this is the new norm of the way to I think about the growth rates and may be what you're seeing here in the U.S. in terms of growth? And then just in the appendix of the deck some of the headcount numbers, do you think you feel like you're where you need to be now in terms of the sales and marketing headcount. Is this where we should think about it through the rest of the year? Thanks. Peer Schatz Sure, if you look at the 331 numbers, they already reflect the steep increase and in particular the QuantiFERON lab and clinical sales channel that we created. There is an overlap with the general sales channel that we have certainly in the laboratories, but we decided to create a focused approach that is now targeting particularly the QuantiFERON portfolio. And that was increased substantially over the last 12 months not talking 20%, 30%. We are talking tripling or even quadrupling and this is already reflected in the headcount numbers in the first quarter. So, as these people are coming on and being trained and this happened over the last six months, So partly even in March of this year, we're expecting to see the effect in particular in the second half of the year. We've seen and tracked and monitored regions where we have implemented these additional resources and we've seen very positive effect. And so we're looking forward to also see that with the resources that have also more recently come on board. In other words, yes. So we expect also this would further underscore what Roland had in his comments in terms of also having more accelerated investments into areas that have higher growth and we expect that to see -- we expect to see pay off in the second half of the year. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Scott Bardo Yeah, thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two please. Firstly understand clearly that you have relatively good management on some of the operating costs SG&A and the mid R&D cost. I think historically one that surprises has been some volatility in gross margin and so what I just wanted to bit come to back to please is your confidence in gross margin and is there any chance of any volatility in CDX contracts that you saw last year perhaps you can describe some of these dynamics as to manufacturing product consolidations some of the production when the benefit come please. So just we can get some comfort margin will be delivered. And second question please and just relates to GeneReader. Obviously some encouraging commentary about an issue or I know you're still due to place your targets for the market. Can you give us a flavor of how demand is tracking insofar as are you just seeing any blip for loyal historic QIAGEN customers or is the pace of interest accelerating or do you expect linear placements going forward. Just give us some sense of dynamic for the placement power of GeneReader and also when you expect some of these new panels to come to market? Thank you. Roland Sackers Let me take it off with the gross margin question. I think Scott you're pointing to a very important point, the gross margin I would say in QIAGEN especially if you look at our instrumentation and also our consumer business is actually quite stable and even slightly improving. So volatility comes all this with two factors. One is we talked about in the past is this Companion Diagnostic deals where we developed products for Pharma partners. They are first of all have a quite significant quarterly volatility and of course it comes in with quite significantly lower gross margin and that is clearly something. But it's not helpful from time to time for the overall gross margin and that is again one part of the impact you have seen in the first quarter as well and another one is as you know we start sometime ago to adjust for certain restructuring cost and therefore we had to float it through our overall cost of sales. Something what we actually should review that we point to that going forward probably more precise that is better thing something what you can put it in your model. And nevertheless it's clearly -- it's important to emphasize such underline consumer trends in terms of profitability as well as everything I want to simply is actually intact and helpful and solid for QIAGEN. And therefore we come from our gross margin at 70% plus probably even again also here a certain acceleration from the second -- into the fourth quarter. Peer Schatz And Scott to the first question this is a system that is going into accounts Clinical Research Diagnostics that we not necessarily buy something just off the shelf even with the QIAGEN logo, which clearly goes a long way. Most of these customers that are around the world by the way they certainly are QIAGEN customers as we said before almost every pathology lab or any clinical research lab around the world is a customer of ours and so we do have relationships and say recognition of the brand equity. So that said the first who to came in are ones that had a very pressing need and in many cases a frustration with the complexity of the current workflows that are much more complex than typically when it's led to believe and in particular in routine testing. And so by creating the simplicity or allowing the simplicity on the pathway to profitable economics for laboratory to be visible, this has allowed people that I wouldn't even call early adopters, but people who are just in the right phase in their decision making process to step in. We expect this to accelerate going forward and in particular when you see more data coming out which looks very good and we have been getting great feedback in the meantime from many test accounts and many early adopters already and we're looking forward to put more data out in also more studies. And also it’s not a blip. It is the beginning of a trajectory and one that we feel very confident about and the message is resonating and in particular QIAGEN is very welcomed into this market with the approach that we are taking. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve Beuchaw Hi good morning and good afternoon. Peer Schatz Good morning, Steve. Steve Beuchaw Two questions for me, one is I wonder if we could just get a little bit more comfort around the Applied Line, are there any trends you could point to with regard to orders of the backlog that give you what is clearly very high levels of confidence in the growth profile in the Applied Line over the balance of the year? And then second for me relates actually to the repurchase announcement, the 100 is similar to what you've done in prior years, why is 100 the right number given that the stock is offered recent highs and we have confidence in acceleration over the back half of the year, why not think about a more aggressive deployment of capital or return of capital to shareholders, thanks? Peer Schatz Sure I’ll take the first question. The second for Roland, the Applied Testing portfolio let's say, it's a smaller part of our revenue basis and sometimes it's a little bit more volatile. There are also tenders in there that in particular ex-US that can impact volatility. That said, the first quarter was primarily impacted by a lower instrument purchase trend that we -- our team expects to here see accelerate over the course of the year and we believe that the applied testing revenue will meet it's targets that we set for this year. The business is growing actually very well. On the consumables side, we had some very high profile wins also in the U.S. following the entry into that market with assays. As you know we've been in the market for 25 years now with the sample technologies and have an extremely strong position in that area, but entered last year with the assays very attractive also nine digit market size. And we're seeing our first highly competitive wins against incumbents with what we think is a very attractive alternative and that is still early, but is on a long term trajectory this is typically a very conservative market, Roland? Roland Sackers Yeah on the shallow what we want to do is a very balanced approach and it is clearly something also what we want to see mid and long term and if you see situations where we want to actually weigh it, there might be even different tools to do so. Just would like to remind you what we did for example early last year where we bought an outstanding convertible bond at that time which was another $250 million. So for us share buybacks was something what we see as a general part of our capital allocation policies -- policy and that includes such share buybacks, but it also clearly includes also bolt-on acquisitions. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Please go ahead. Daniel Wendorff Yeah, thanks for taking my questions one main question and then a follow-up please and main question taking into account what you've said on tracking of costs during the year of 2016 and also if we think of the EBIT margin and just going forward into Q2 and then also in the second half, is it that Q2 is like similar to what we observed in the first quarter and then the jump in the second half. So any more color there would be helpful. And second question is also relating to your NGS portfolio now with the GeneReader on the market, can you potentially comment on the number of early adopters you're currently working with and the eventual number of like targeted adopters of the target clinical laboratories, any comment there would also be helpful. Thank you. Roland Sackers Yeah, Daniel let me take the first part. Yeah I think as we try to lay out in the call is that we do expect exploration here and important not only in terms of revenue growth, but especially also in terms of profitability over the course of the year and that probably goes from let’s say a 120 percentage adjusted EBIT margin in the second quarter into an area which is probably a 30% plus in the fourth quarter and somewhere in the middle of the third quarter. So, I think you clearly can expect a similar pattern we’ve seen in the past. I know this is just again if you look at the absolute dollar numbers that some of this expense is into the first and second quarter for targeting investments. As we said I want launch activities on QuantiFERON sales specialist and regional expansion and how this cost fading away. So the profitability should shine through again there is also good margin improvement in the third and fourth quarter. Peer Schatz The first question Daniel was on the GeneReader, well we said we would give further color on the success in the progress in this area later in the year. We said that the uptake is much broader and much faster than what we initially had anticipated and put in our plan. We expect that trend to continue. The size of the market is very much a function of the content. That was a good question in the call today also on that and the QIAact Actionable Tumor Panel, that actually addresses one of the largest applications, but it’s in most of these laboratories. But we're going to expand from there with additional features, modalities and also different indications as well. So if you take the narrow definition, we’re not talking of a market size of dozens of systems. This is hundreds of systems a year and we said also in our commentary we're targeting a double-digit market share in the first year, which I think is quite remarkable for a solution like this and one that is the beginning of a more long term trajectory. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel Hi, thank you for taking the questions. First topic is I guess really a quick one just a guidance clarification, excluding FX you reiterated EPS guidance for the year, you also reiterated gross margin guidance, you lowered tax rate for the year. I just want to make sure that logically we are appropriate in concluding that the offset here is all increased operating spend, which would be based on other commentary. You would expect to be heavily weighted towards Q2. And then the second topic is again GeneReader, there has been lots of qualitative commentary on placements exceeding expectations and demand exceeding expectations and how well you're doing here. You've spent considerable time on this again today. You clearly have a lot of excitement about this initiative. That said in the absence of really anything qualitative, I’m sorry quantitative, it’s really hard for us to know how meaningful this initiative is. I believe you have nothing in guidance for GeneReader of revenue contributions for this year. I guess it would be helpful if you could provide anything quantifiable. You mentioned Peer that you expect to have double-digit market share in the first year of the launch. There are several thousand next-gen sequencing instruments out there, is that how you’re defining the market and in terms of in Q1 exceeding expectations, you said you expect to have hundreds out there not dozens. Do you have more than a dozen instruments out there and are they in production? Thank you. Peer Schatz Let me start specifically with the question on tax, I think the adjustments we made here to the tax guidance is really to cover the performance for the first quarter where we came in at '15, I don’t expect any change on the overall mix for the second, third and fourth quarter therefore only a slight improvement from '17 to '16 to '17 for the year. Roland Sackers Doug, there were many questions in that, so I try to address that. So we shared a lot and we shared our positioning, our positioning is definitely not addressing the thousands of sequencers that are out there. We were very clear and this is what we also put into this presentation of the slide. And we're targeting a sub-segment of the market that is targeting panel testing and clinical research and diagnostics and that immediately takes your thousands down to hundreds as I said before and if you would look at the market share is in the hundreds and then look at double-digit market share you don’t get hundreds or thousands of systems that we're targeting. But it is a very doable number for us and yes we are in that trajectory and we feel very confident also that the pipeline and the commitments and also the indications that we're receiving will allow us to get there. So the question is also here how that sub-segment of the market again panel testing and clinical research and diagnostics, how that will expand with further indications going forward and that's why we gave you some of the panel roadmap that would allow further indications and further utility and also a broader audience to be open to the GeneReader system. The reason why we’re excited about this is because this has been a significant investment phase. It’s important product for us and the first feedback is very positive and I am sure you appreciate that this is for us important feedback for you that we feel very confident that this has been a good investment that we did over last few years. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg of UBS. Please go ahead. Jon Groberg Thanks. Just a couple of questions from me that we are getting from clients, one, Roland can you maybe just clarify why currency isn’t more favorable than what you're laying it out most of the other company has reported that the currency having improved they're laying out I would say a more favorable outlook both from a revenue and EPS standpoint, business might really changing the EPS impact. And then second would you be willing to quantify anything around Exiqon in terms of what it could be mean for -- what you think it means for the business from an accretion to margins, EPS is expected to close? Roland Sackers Peer you want to start with the second one or… Peer Schatz Why don't you take this? Roland Sackers Okay. First I'll start with this second one on Exiqon again I think it's fairly straightforward and there is a pending deal would just refer to what we said in terms of our press release and again I don’t want to be a too aggressive now because it is has closed yet. Nevertheless I would say we clearly said there is a lot of synergies clearly for us in terms of again focus and fitting into your company portfolio and profitability for contribution is also quite clear that it doesn’t contribute to profitability in '16 and '17. On the FX question of course I can’t comment on other companies that therefore has little difficult but again I would like to refer to is we do have quite detailed breakdown in our appendix on where we have our currency movements and I think the one thing you should have in mind is of course if you're looking at our mix, the volatility for us comes especially on the profitability side comes always out of the countries where we do not have any cost base, there is not typically dollar Euro, there we do actually have a I would say good natural hedge. It is well in countries where we don’t have any larger cost base and this is typically in larger markets where we have just the sales force typically and therefore any swings here is serving us more other companies who have a larger local presence where even production locally. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.  Vijay Kumar Hey, guys thanks for squeezing me in. So I had a two part question. One on the financial side and one big picture for Peer. So may be on the financial side going back to the guidance sequential ramp, 4% fee or revenue growth in that Q2. So as you think about that back half high single, so we understand HPV goes where so that adds 100, 200 Bps and I think I heard you say guidance doesn’t break anything any contribution from leaders. So what gives you comfort is this applied market normalizing or something happening within diagnostics or even academia that gives you the confidence and the big picture question for Peer was, what are you seeing up here from a big picture perspective on sequencing landscape, but obviously you're one of your large competitors and they have had some issues on the high end of the market and clearly you guys bring the opportunity as of the low end of the market right the big box versus the small box. And I’m just curious if you're seeing anything just given that QIAGEN is the largest sample provider and you guys are probably more likely to see trends in that market before we see thanks. Roland Sackers Hi, Vijay I was likely that I’m only responsible for the fine print and not for the big picture, but having said that I think it’s a fair question, but I think as said before it’s clearly driven by the ramp up mainly in our gross status but also academic markets moving into the right direction. So, its general both, have in mind also and I think there is something what I would like to remind you that of course the prior year dynamics are also important to factor in last year in the first and second quarter where has had high single digit ex-HPV growth where it was clearly different in the third and fourth quarter so also comps are important to include in your calculation. So I think if you factor it all in and also again having in mind is what we said before 47, 53 allocation H1, H2 I think that should be doable. Peer Schatz So, Vijay what we basically see and what you also see in the market right now is that the high end markets that are little bit more volatile. That said, I would say that the competition is actually doing a great job in serving that market and the demand will continue to increase going forward. It is a fundamental technology that will clearly have a very long term trajectory also in terms of the market development and that said we -- and that’s a very important differentiation that where QIAGEN fits in.  And also saw some of the surveys and studies we're not going to last are typically running five sequences already or more going to labs that are typically using these technologies for everyday use and to create utility in particular in clinical research and diagnostic and that’s a totally different ball game. The value proposition to the high end labs that you will get from those labs is very different to labs who are actually using this as a tool they don’t want to couple together these workflows. They don’t want to add the newest reagent or instrument to the work flow. They want to have something that works and works very reliably and creates utility for them and that’s something that our solutions cater to. It is a new value proposition and one that is resonating very well with the different market segment than the ones that we're traditionally very focused on in terms of seeing trends and also understanding demand profiles and sequencing. This is a newly emerging area, one that is as partly also already been doing sequencing, but in many cases it’s frustrated. Many of the sequencers are not productive in these areas and people are looking for a way to actually be able to generate economics and value for their patients and that is a market that we think is new and emerging and one that is resonating well to our value proposition. But I think sequencing overall is a long-term trajectory and again upon many of the efforts also from competitors who drive this technology forward. Peer Schatz So with that, I would like to end this call and thank all of you for your participation today. If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. Thank you very much. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call.

[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Daniel Arias of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias Good morning. Can you guys hear me? Peer Schatz Yeah, good morning, Dan. How are you? Daniel Arias Okay, thanks, doing well. Roland on the expense structure, how confident are you in the budget that you have here at this point for your growth initiatives? Obviously between the GeneReader and QuantiFERON and liquid biopsy there is a good deal of market development to be done. So as you push into these opportunities, I’m just curious what the error bands look like at this point in terms of the investment levels that you’ve baked in? Roland Sackers I think we have our hands very well around our expense structures because the reason while I think we've very excellent and explained in early January this year when we give guidance and we delivered exactly what we were planning for the first quarter. If you look on the areas we decided where we invest in it's a very -- this is very focused activity we could expect and doing quite well. And if you look on the big aspect on the allocation to second slide and fourth quarter, just take first quarter one way and if you would use this as a basis for the fourth quarter assuming for the next three quarters, assuming still there is a certain pick up in the second quarter, you will see that with expected revenue increase we will do quite nicely our guidance. So I guess there is a lot of execution required and nevertheless we're very focused around that and definitely see that. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.  Bill Quirk Great, thank you, good afternoon. I've one question and a quick follow-up. So first off and this is somewhat related to Dan’s question, so Roland thinking about the plan consolidation in the first quarter, presumably this should help you in future periods, if so can you just help us think about the magnitude of that and then again I have follow-up, thanks. Roland Sackers Yeah good question, I think but what we just spelled out here in the first quarter is that we're still trying to consolidate as many production size into our larger regional hubs here in Germany as well in Maryland and the U.S. and clearly this is quite helpful for all level at the end of the day. And if you assume for a second that our gross margin in the first quarter was roughly 100 basis point below I would say average run rate of the three quarters, half of that was really one time impact. And therefore we feel quite confident that also over the next three quarters the gross margin as well as going about 70% and even the larger share in the third and fourth quarter. Bill Quirk Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just on OUS HPV it's obviously been a nice growth driver for you in the past. It looks like it slowed down here this quarter. We didn’t pick up anything in the competitive results and so I’m curious was this just a lack of tenders in the quarter or is perhaps the market slowing outside the U.S. thank you. Peer Schatz You’re absolutely right on that one that that business is a tender business typically ex-US and therefore it is little bit lumpier and you’ll see more volatility in that growth rate, but we remain incredibly well positioned competitively and are seeing competitive wins pretty much continually. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson Hey thanks, two quick ones. First on GeneReader, I am trying to understand how you’re managing the reimbursement dynamic with your customers with the $550 gene reimbursement down around $600. It seems like a lot of labs are having a hard time making the profit. So just wondering how active you are in helping with some of the reimbursement discussion? And then separately Peer, I’m trying to get a better comfort in the guidance for the year. I mean by our math and you did do about 7% to 8% organic in the back half and you’re coming off 2% in the first quarter 4% in the second quarter. So maybe just get us comfortable with what further drive that revenue reacceleration in the back half of the year? I know you do have easier comps? Peer Schatz Sure. Okay so the first question obviously we are moving through and preparing also the appropriate regulatory processes to be able to position these systems adequate, but if you look at the system and also the panel as it designed today, it’s designed for very attractive economics and we're one of the few providers who can actually provide a positive value contribution to laboratories and allow laboratories to create a profit. Once you actually take all of the components and all of the services required to do a next generation sequencing run together, this often is not one or two suppliers, but this is often more than a dozen that come together for a complete work flow. Costs are much higher than most labs normally would think and looking at price per insight model where we actually are able to integrate everything from the primary sample through the report and create a very, very reliable price per insight for that, that is actually in a range that allows a very attractive margin even under these new reduced panel rates. That is something that is driving a lot of customers to look at this and see this as a really viable option. Its different in different countries around the world, but the economics of is not really just economics of the sequencing reaction. That’s actually a small fraction of it. The majority of the economics of the cost of the work flow and various steps around the sequencing reaction upfront and downstream and we have created a fully integrated system that takes care of that. In terms of the revenue distribution I'll hand over to Roland in a minute, but I guess the one statement that he made in his comments was very important that we’re pretty much comparable in terms of the revenue distribution we’re guiding for this year to what we saw last year. The revenue distribution last year was something like 48%, 52% of full year revenue target and this year its depending on what number you use would be above 47% to 53%. So it's not really materially different and considering that we’re seeing these strong growth rates in key product areas such as QuantiFERON and others that are doing very well now moving into the second quarter we feel quite good about that revenue target. This issue with the profits accelerating in the second half of the year is not a revenue story. It is a cost management story, because we accelerated expenses in the first half that we're confidently will show a nice benefit in the second half and therefore would allow us to slow down expense growth. Operator Our question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to focus on Slide 9 with your GeneReader roadmap and appreciate, there is probably a lot of detail you don’t offer today, but I was hoping to maybe comment on two items. First was in the sample type expansion comments where you're looking at liquid biopsy does that relate specifically to liquid biopsy samples for research work or would it be actually clinical diagnostics, to liquid biopsy on GeneReader. Peer Schatz Sure, while so the liquid biopsy sample technology solutions we have today are very widely used. We're selling millions of these every year and we also have announced to the market that we are going to launch new versions that also will have clinical claims attached to them. So the GeneReader NGS system is a system targeting clinical research and diagnostics and therefore the liquid biopsy solutions that we will be bringing on to the system will be solutions that will be quarter below into into clinical work flows as well. The system as you know the frontend system, the QIAcube, is today already automating the clinical sample -- the DNA, liquid biopsy solutions that are registered with FDA and this will therefore be an integration of already of very robust and highly validated system. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan Thanks, good morning. I had two somewhat really questions with QuantiFERON, nice to see the sales force investment starting to pay off. I am curious, do you think this is the new norm of the way to I think about the growth rates and may be what you're seeing here in the U.S. in terms of growth? And then just in the appendix of the deck some of the headcount numbers, do you think you feel like you're where you need to be now in terms of the sales and marketing headcount. Is this where we should think about it through the rest of the year? Thanks. Peer Schatz Sure, if you look at the 331 numbers, they already reflect the steep increase and in particular the QuantiFERON lab and clinical sales channel that we created. There is an overlap with the general sales channel that we have certainly in the laboratories, but we decided to create a focused approach that is now targeting particularly the QuantiFERON portfolio. And that was increased substantially over the last 12 months not talking 20%, 30%. We are talking tripling or even quadrupling and this is already reflected in the headcount numbers in the first quarter. So, as these people are coming on and being trained and this happened over the last six months, So partly even in March of this year, we're expecting to see the effect in particular in the second half of the year. We've seen and tracked and monitored regions where we have implemented these additional resources and we've seen very positive effect. And so we're looking forward to also see that with the resources that have also more recently come on board. In other words, yes. So we expect also this would further underscore what Roland had in his comments in terms of also having more accelerated investments into areas that have higher growth and we expect that to see -- we expect to see pay off in the second half of the year. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Scott Bardo Yeah, thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two please. Firstly understand clearly that you have relatively good management on some of the operating costs SG&A and the mid R&D cost. I think historically one that surprises has been some volatility in gross margin and so what I just wanted to bit come to back to please is your confidence in gross margin and is there any chance of any volatility in CDX contracts that you saw last year perhaps you can describe some of these dynamics as to manufacturing product consolidations some of the production when the benefit come please. So just we can get some comfort margin will be delivered. And second question please and just relates to GeneReader. Obviously some encouraging commentary about an issue or I know you're still due to place your targets for the market. Can you give us a flavor of how demand is tracking insofar as are you just seeing any blip for loyal historic QIAGEN customers or is the pace of interest accelerating or do you expect linear placements going forward. Just give us some sense of dynamic for the placement power of GeneReader and also when you expect some of these new panels to come to market? Thank you. Roland Sackers Let me take it off with the gross margin question. I think Scott you're pointing to a very important point, the gross margin I would say in QIAGEN especially if you look at our instrumentation and also our consumer business is actually quite stable and even slightly improving. So volatility comes all this with two factors. One is we talked about in the past is this Companion Diagnostic deals where we developed products for Pharma partners. They are first of all have a quite significant quarterly volatility and of course it comes in with quite significantly lower gross margin and that is clearly something. But it's not helpful from time to time for the overall gross margin and that is again one part of the impact you have seen in the first quarter as well and another one is as you know we start sometime ago to adjust for certain restructuring cost and therefore we had to float it through our overall cost of sales. Something what we actually should review that we point to that going forward probably more precise that is better thing something what you can put it in your model. And nevertheless it's clearly -- it's important to emphasize such underline consumer trends in terms of profitability as well as everything I want to simply is actually intact and helpful and solid for QIAGEN. And therefore we come from our gross margin at 70% plus probably even again also here a certain acceleration from the second -- into the fourth quarter. Peer Schatz And Scott to the first question this is a system that is going into accounts Clinical Research Diagnostics that we not necessarily buy something just off the shelf even with the QIAGEN logo, which clearly goes a long way. Most of these customers that are around the world by the way they certainly are QIAGEN customers as we said before almost every pathology lab or any clinical research lab around the world is a customer of ours and so we do have relationships and say recognition of the brand equity. So that said the first who to came in are ones that had a very pressing need and in many cases a frustration with the complexity of the current workflows that are much more complex than typically when it's led to believe and in particular in routine testing. And so by creating the simplicity or allowing the simplicity on the pathway to profitable economics for laboratory to be visible, this has allowed people that I wouldn't even call early adopters, but people who are just in the right phase in their decision making process to step in. We expect this to accelerate going forward and in particular when you see more data coming out which looks very good and we have been getting great feedback in the meantime from many test accounts and many early adopters already and we're looking forward to put more data out in also more studies. And also it’s not a blip. It is the beginning of a trajectory and one that we feel very confident about and the message is resonating and in particular QIAGEN is very welcomed into this market with the approach that we are taking. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve Beuchaw Hi good morning and good afternoon. Peer Schatz Good morning, Steve. Steve Beuchaw Two questions for me, one is I wonder if we could just get a little bit more comfort around the Applied Line, are there any trends you could point to with regard to orders of the backlog that give you what is clearly very high levels of confidence in the growth profile in the Applied Line over the balance of the year? And then second for me relates actually to the repurchase announcement, the 100 is similar to what you've done in prior years, why is 100 the right number given that the stock is offered recent highs and we have confidence in acceleration over the back half of the year, why not think about a more aggressive deployment of capital or return of capital to shareholders, thanks? Peer Schatz Sure I’ll take the first question. The second for Roland, the Applied Testing portfolio let's say, it's a smaller part of our revenue basis and sometimes it's a little bit more volatile. There are also tenders in there that in particular ex-US that can impact volatility. That said, the first quarter was primarily impacted by a lower instrument purchase trend that we -- our team expects to here see accelerate over the course of the year and we believe that the applied testing revenue will meet it's targets that we set for this year. The business is growing actually very well. On the consumables side, we had some very high profile wins also in the U.S. following the entry into that market with assays. As you know we've been in the market for 25 years now with the sample technologies and have an extremely strong position in that area, but entered last year with the assays very attractive also nine digit market size. And we're seeing our first highly competitive wins against incumbents with what we think is a very attractive alternative and that is still early, but is on a long term trajectory this is typically a very conservative market, Roland? Roland Sackers Yeah on the shallow what we want to do is a very balanced approach and it is clearly something also what we want to see mid and long term and if you see situations where we want to actually weigh it, there might be even different tools to do so. Just would like to remind you what we did for example early last year where we bought an outstanding convertible bond at that time which was another $250 million. So for us share buybacks was something what we see as a general part of our capital allocation policies -- policy and that includes such share buybacks, but it also clearly includes also bolt-on acquisitions. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Please go ahead. Daniel Wendorff Yeah, thanks for taking my questions one main question and then a follow-up please and main question taking into account what you've said on tracking of costs during the year of 2016 and also if we think of the EBIT margin and just going forward into Q2 and then also in the second half, is it that Q2 is like similar to what we observed in the first quarter and then the jump in the second half. So any more color there would be helpful. And second question is also relating to your NGS portfolio now with the GeneReader on the market, can you potentially comment on the number of early adopters you're currently working with and the eventual number of like targeted adopters of the target clinical laboratories, any comment there would also be helpful. Thank you. Roland Sackers Yeah, Daniel let me take the first part. Yeah I think as we try to lay out in the call is that we do expect exploration here and important not only in terms of revenue growth, but especially also in terms of profitability over the course of the year and that probably goes from let’s say a 120 percentage adjusted EBIT margin in the second quarter into an area which is probably a 30% plus in the fourth quarter and somewhere in the middle of the third quarter. So, I think you clearly can expect a similar pattern we’ve seen in the past. I know this is just again if you look at the absolute dollar numbers that some of this expense is into the first and second quarter for targeting investments. As we said I want launch activities on QuantiFERON sales specialist and regional expansion and how this cost fading away. So the profitability should shine through again there is also good margin improvement in the third and fourth quarter. Peer Schatz The first question Daniel was on the GeneReader, well we said we would give further color on the success in the progress in this area later in the year. We said that the uptake is much broader and much faster than what we initially had anticipated and put in our plan. We expect that trend to continue. The size of the market is very much a function of the content. That was a good question in the call today also on that and the QIAact Actionable Tumor Panel, that actually addresses one of the largest applications, but it’s in most of these laboratories. But we're going to expand from there with additional features, modalities and also different indications as well. So if you take the narrow definition, we’re not talking of a market size of dozens of systems. This is hundreds of systems a year and we said also in our commentary we're targeting a double-digit market share in the first year, which I think is quite remarkable for a solution like this and one that is the beginning of a more long term trajectory. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel Hi, thank you for taking the questions. First topic is I guess really a quick one just a guidance clarification, excluding FX you reiterated EPS guidance for the year, you also reiterated gross margin guidance, you lowered tax rate for the year. I just want to make sure that logically we are appropriate in concluding that the offset here is all increased operating spend, which would be based on other commentary. You would expect to be heavily weighted towards Q2. And then the second topic is again GeneReader, there has been lots of qualitative commentary on placements exceeding expectations and demand exceeding expectations and how well you're doing here. You've spent considerable time on this again today. You clearly have a lot of excitement about this initiative. That said in the absence of really anything qualitative, I’m sorry quantitative, it’s really hard for us to know how meaningful this initiative is. I believe you have nothing in guidance for GeneReader of revenue contributions for this year. I guess it would be helpful if you could provide anything quantifiable. You mentioned Peer that you expect to have double-digit market share in the first year of the launch. There are several thousand next-gen sequencing instruments out there, is that how you’re defining the market and in terms of in Q1 exceeding expectations, you said you expect to have hundreds out there not dozens. Do you have more than a dozen instruments out there and are they in production? Thank you. Peer Schatz Let me start specifically with the question on tax, I think the adjustments we made here to the tax guidance is really to cover the performance for the first quarter where we came in at '15, I don’t expect any change on the overall mix for the second, third and fourth quarter therefore only a slight improvement from '17 to '16 to '17 for the year. Roland Sackers Doug, there were many questions in that, so I try to address that. So we shared a lot and we shared our positioning, our positioning is definitely not addressing the thousands of sequencers that are out there. We were very clear and this is what we also put into this presentation of the slide. And we're targeting a sub-segment of the market that is targeting panel testing and clinical research and diagnostics and that immediately takes your thousands down to hundreds as I said before and if you would look at the market share is in the hundreds and then look at double-digit market share you don’t get hundreds or thousands of systems that we're targeting. But it is a very doable number for us and yes we are in that trajectory and we feel very confident also that the pipeline and the commitments and also the indications that we're receiving will allow us to get there. So the question is also here how that sub-segment of the market again panel testing and clinical research and diagnostics, how that will expand with further indications going forward and that's why we gave you some of the panel roadmap that would allow further indications and further utility and also a broader audience to be open to the GeneReader system. The reason why we’re excited about this is because this has been a significant investment phase. It’s important product for us and the first feedback is very positive and I am sure you appreciate that this is for us important feedback for you that we feel very confident that this has been a good investment that we did over last few years. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg of UBS. Please go ahead. Jon Groberg Thanks. Just a couple of questions from me that we are getting from clients, one, Roland can you maybe just clarify why currency isn’t more favorable than what you're laying it out most of the other company has reported that the currency having improved they're laying out I would say a more favorable outlook both from a revenue and EPS standpoint, business might really changing the EPS impact. And then second would you be willing to quantify anything around Exiqon in terms of what it could be mean for -- what you think it means for the business from an accretion to margins, EPS is expected to close? Roland Sackers Peer you want to start with the second one or… Peer Schatz Why don't you take this? Roland Sackers Okay. First I'll start with this second one on Exiqon again I think it's fairly straightforward and there is a pending deal would just refer to what we said in terms of our press release and again I don’t want to be a too aggressive now because it is has closed yet. Nevertheless I would say we clearly said there is a lot of synergies clearly for us in terms of again focus and fitting into your company portfolio and profitability for contribution is also quite clear that it doesn’t contribute to profitability in '16 and '17. On the FX question of course I can’t comment on other companies that therefore has little difficult but again I would like to refer to is we do have quite detailed breakdown in our appendix on where we have our currency movements and I think the one thing you should have in mind is of course if you're looking at our mix, the volatility for us comes especially on the profitability side comes always out of the countries where we do not have any cost base, there is not typically dollar Euro, there we do actually have a I would say good natural hedge. It is well in countries where we don’t have any larger cost base and this is typically in larger markets where we have just the sales force typically and therefore any swings here is serving us more other companies who have a larger local presence where even production locally. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.  Vijay Kumar Hey, guys thanks for squeezing me in. So I had a two part question. One on the financial side and one big picture for Peer. So may be on the financial side going back to the guidance sequential ramp, 4% fee or revenue growth in that Q2. So as you think about that back half high single, so we understand HPV goes where so that adds 100, 200 Bps and I think I heard you say guidance doesn’t break anything any contribution from leaders. So what gives you comfort is this applied market normalizing or something happening within diagnostics or even academia that gives you the confidence and the big picture question for Peer was, what are you seeing up here from a big picture perspective on sequencing landscape, but obviously you're one of your large competitors and they have had some issues on the high end of the market and clearly you guys bring the opportunity as of the low end of the market right the big box versus the small box. And I’m just curious if you're seeing anything just given that QIAGEN is the largest sample provider and you guys are probably more likely to see trends in that market before we see thanks. Roland Sackers Hi, Vijay I was likely that I’m only responsible for the fine print and not for the big picture, but having said that I think it’s a fair question, but I think as said before it’s clearly driven by the ramp up mainly in our gross status but also academic markets moving into the right direction. So, its general both, have in mind also and I think there is something what I would like to remind you that of course the prior year dynamics are also important to factor in last year in the first and second quarter where has had high single digit ex-HPV growth where it was clearly different in the third and fourth quarter so also comps are important to include in your calculation. So I think if you factor it all in and also again having in mind is what we said before 47, 53 allocation H1, H2 I think that should be doable. Peer Schatz So, Vijay what we basically see and what you also see in the market right now is that the high end markets that are little bit more volatile. That said, I would say that the competition is actually doing a great job in serving that market and the demand will continue to increase going forward. It is a fundamental technology that will clearly have a very long term trajectory also in terms of the market development and that said we -- and that’s a very important differentiation that where QIAGEN fits in.  And also saw some of the surveys and studies we're not going to last are typically running five sequences already or more going to labs that are typically using these technologies for everyday use and to create utility in particular in clinical research and diagnostic and that’s a totally different ball game. The value proposition to the high end labs that you will get from those labs is very different to labs who are actually using this as a tool they don’t want to couple together these workflows. They don’t want to add the newest reagent or instrument to the work flow. They want to have something that works and works very reliably and creates utility for them and that’s something that our solutions cater to. It is a new value proposition and one that is resonating very well with the different market segment than the ones that we're traditionally very focused on in terms of seeing trends and also understanding demand profiles and sequencing. This is a newly emerging area, one that is as partly also already been doing sequencing, but in many cases it’s frustrated. Many of the sequencers are not productive in these areas and people are looking for a way to actually be able to generate economics and value for their patients and that is a market that we think is new and emerging and one that is resonating well to our value proposition. But I think sequencing overall is a long-term trajectory and again upon many of the efforts also from competitors who drive this technology forward. Peer Schatz So with that, I would like to end this call and thank all of you for your participation today. If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. Thank you very much. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call.

Our speakers today are Peer Schatz, the Chief Executive Officer of QIAGEN, and Roland Sackers, the Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us today is Dr. Sarah Fakih, a member of our IR team. On Slide 2 you'll see the customary Safe Harbor statement explaining that the discussion and responses to your questions on this call reflect management's views as of today, July 29, 2016. We will be making statements and providing responses to your questions that state our intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future, and these constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the Safe Harbor provisions. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. QIAGEN disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements. For more information please refer to our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Also during the call we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can find a reconciliation of these figures to GAAP in the press release and the presentation for this call. I also have these quick points. First, we're providing a new level of disclosure with sales figures by customer class and regions and percentage changes at actual and CER rates. Historical data is available in the appendix to the presentation. Second, we are planning to hold an analyst and investor day in New York on Tuesday, November 15, which will be a few days after the annual Association for Molecular Pathology meeting in Charlotte. We will provide an update on the time and location for this meeting later in the quarter. With that, I would like to now hand over to Peer. Peer Schatz Thank you, John. And I like to welcome all of you to this conference call. Our performance for the second quarter of 2016 shows the significant progress QIAGEN has been making to advance our position as a leader in molecular testing solutions. The results also confirm QIAGEN is at an important inflection point and is now setting a new sales growth trajectory. Let me go through our key messages. First, we had a very strong performance in the second quarter. These results were actually ahead of our targets and this was due to the solid volume expansion across our life sciences and molecular diagnostics customer classes. Net sales rose 6% at constant exchange rates, which was ahead of our outlook of 4% constant exchange rate growth. Sales at actual rates rose 5% to $334 million, and this included 1 percentage point of currency headwinds. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.24 at both actual and constant exchange rates and ahead of our target for $0.22, while free cash flow rose 75% to $78 million. Second, QIAGEN is at an important reflection point and setting a new sales growth trajectory. As I just mentioned, the sales performance for the second quarter of 2016 was an important step up from the 2% constant exchange rate growth in the first quarter of this year. Most important, the 8% constant exchange rate and ex HPV underlying sales growth in the second quarter is comparable with our target growth rates for the second half of 2016, and this charts us on a solid trajectory to achieve our full-year sales growth target. Our focus is also on achieving the full-year targets for higher adjusted EPS and to build on the sales acceleration while intensifying our focus on managing costs to improve operating leverage. Our growth drivers are leading this transformation. This portfolio now represents about 35% of sales and kept a double-digit constant exchange rate growth pace, and also supported the solid performances in all of our customer classes. The growth drivers included the QuantiFERON latent TB test growing above the 25% constant exchange rate annual target rate, along with ongoing strong placements of QIAsymphony automation systems and double-digit constant exchange rate growth related to QIAsymphony consumables. Keep in mind that about 40% of these QIAsymphony systems are also placed with life science and related customers. We are also pleased to have completed the acquisition of Exiqon and have to have done this under the original offer terms. We have added a top player in the fast growing field of non-coding RNA, bringing in the synergistic portfolio in RNA analysis about bioinformatics fanatics that will make our offering even more compelling. The results and events of the second quarter give a demonstration of the progress QIAGEN has made over the last few years to transform this portfolio and develop an even stronger growth profile as a leader in molecular testing solutions. We have a unique competitive advantage in being able to leverage the vast majority of this portfolio across the continuum of customers in both the life sciences and molecular diagnostics area. This has taken a lot of hard work and effort, and it took about a year longer than we expected, but we are now moving ahead with a clear perspective for significant value creation. Third, we have announced an increased commitment to return $300 million of capital to our shareholders by the end of 2017. Our intent is to significantly step up our returns beyond the announcement earlier this year for the fourth $100 million share repurchase program. This increased commitment is a result of our conviction that we are facing an attractive trend change and significant value creation at QIAGEN. Through the efforts of the last few years, we've created a very strong commercial portfolio and have a very attractive R&D pipeline. We are intensifying our focus on translating these efforts into faster sales growth while managing costs to gaining more operational leverage. And as a final point, we are on track for higher sales and adjusted earnings. We have updated our targets following the acquisition of Exiqon and we now expect this acquisition to provide about $10 million of first time sales in the second half of this year, and to also have a neutral impact on adjusted EPS, followed by accretion in the second year. As a result, we now expect net sales growth for the full year of about 6% to 7% on a constant exchange rate basis. This is based on adding the Exiqon contributions on top of the prior outlook for 6% constant exchange rate total sales growth we had announced in January 2016. That outlook was comprised of about 1 percentage point of growth from the acquisition of MO BIO in 2015 and about 5 percentage points from the rest of our portfolio. Keep in mind, this updated outlook continues to anticipate about 1 percentage point of headwinds for the full year from low U.S. HPV test sales, but this could round up to 2 percentage points. In any case, U.S. HPV test sales are expected to be about $30 million for 2016, and represent only 2% of sales. I am now on Slide 5 and would like to put our sales performance into more context. The slide gives you an overview of the year-on-year trends over the last few quarters and years, and the changes are shown at constant exchange rates for the comparable prior periods. As I mentioned, the 6% constant exchange rate sales growth for the second quarter was the fastest rate over this period. Despite some slower trends in the second half of 2015, you see the momentum of our portfolio transformation, and this is reflected in the rising total CER sales growth rate. You also see how the headwind from the U.S. HPV test sales is fading, and this is reflected in the lines moving closer together. In other words, our sales growth trajectory is moving into the higher single-digit range near term, and the expanding contributions of the growth drivers, improving market sentiment in the life sciences, support this trend. We are confident of achieving our full-year 2016 sales goals since the results for the first half show a distribution for 2016 of about 47% in the first half and about 53% now in the second half and this is a similar distribution to 2015. I'm now on Slide 6, to update you on some of our achievements in the second quarter. Sample technologies is an incredibly strong franchise at QIAGEN and internal innovations and targeted acquisitions have further enhanced our leadership position. I will briefly touch on a few of our growth drivers, as well, and these include the QIAsymphony automation system, the QuantiFERON latent TB test, the personalized healthcare portfolio from molecular oncology testing, and our portfolio for next generation sequencing bioinformatics. First, sample technologies continued to deliver solid single digit constant exchange rate growth in the second quarter of 2016 based on improving life science customer trends, and, in particular, higher sales of primary sample technologies. We are moving ahead with the integration of the mobile products with our own technologies to offer, an absolute market leader, even more differentiated solutions, to extract and purify DNA from the most difficult samples for the analysis of microbiomes. This is a very hot field of research. Our personalized healthcare portfolio consists of three elements, which sum up to a total of about $110 million to $120 million of annual sales. The first involve sales of our therascreen and ipsogen companion diagnostic kit. And here we saw largely steady sales trends in the second quarter. The second involves the sale of related products, automation systems and OEM manufacturing of these products. The third involves milestone revenues from co-development projects with pharma companies. This third component was about $35 million in 2015 at constant exchange rates. Although we continue to see a good increase in the number of projects, the milestone revenues continue to show volatility, and this was again the case in the second quarter when these revenues fell 15% to about $6 million at actual rates compared to the second order 2015. We are providing this new level of disclosure on co-development revenues to help you understand this volatility. As we've said before, the strategic value of these deals comes not from the milestone payments during development but from the revenues generated by the resulting assays. Turning to the QIAsymphony automation system, we are moving ahead towards our goal for more than 1,750 cumulative placements by the end of this year, and that compares to more than 1,500 at the end of 2015. I'm now on slide 7 to give you an update about the QuantiFERON latent TB test. We continued to see solid growth during the second quarter of 2016 above the 25% constant exchange rate growth we have set for this year, and even faster growth in the United States. We're starting to reap the benefits from the incremental investments into more sales and marketing resources and accelerating the conversion of a $1 billion total addressable market opportunity. We're also adding to the body of clinical data for QuantiFERON, in particular for the fourth-generation version that was launched late last year in Europe and other markets. About 20 independent investigator initiated studies are currently underway involving almost 30,000 patients to add to the strong evidence base to date. These new studies involved different TB testing groups such as healthcare worker screening, TB exposure contact tracing, co-testing in HIV patients, and required TB screening for students, employees and immigrants. In regard to TB guidelines in the US, a final positive B rating from the US Preventative Services Task Force, or USPS TF, is expected this year. This will provide an opportunity to further position QuantiFERON as the modern solution for the primary care setting, and this includes students and back to school testing. I would also like to address the FDA warning letter related to QuantiFERON, which is an issue we are taking very seriously. The letter described among its findings deficiencies in procedures related to complaint handling, medical device reporting, and corrective and preventative actions. These observations were made after the acquisition of Cellestis but while so operating under their quality system. We have reviewed our plans to correct the situation with FDA and have already taken many actions. These include having completed the transition of QuantiFERON to the QIAGEN quality system, and preventive measures are now in place to move even faster to get acquired companies into the system. We have also insourced a significant share of QuantiFERON production into our FDA-approved German townsite from third-party suppliers. It is hard to predict when the issue will be resolved but it is important to note that QuantiFERON continues to be fully authorized for marketing in the U.S., Europe and around the world. I am now on slide 8 to review a new wave of exciting life sciences product launches that have quite significant revenue potential in the coming years. We are creating new differentiated solutions that enable scientists to gain insights faster, better and more reliably in large and fast-growing research areas. As a first topic, liquid biopsy is obviously a big focus of our innovation efforts given the deep history of QIAGEN as a pioneer in this area. One of the new products is the PAXgene blood system for cell-free DNA. And we want to replicate the great successes we had with the PAXgene blood RNA and DNA systems, as well as the tissue RNA solutions. The cell-free DNA solution is a breakthrough for customers involved in prenatal testing and cancer research. We have drawn upon our deep expertise to deliver an innovation that is essential but not easy to create, and that is to integrate the process for collecting a blood sample with the process to stabilize the cell-free DNA circulating in the blood in order to insure unbiased and targeted DNA purification. We view liquid biopsy sample technologies as a market opportunity well above $100 million at this time, and to be significantly higher as this technology evolves. The second area involves digital next-generation sequencing. This is a unique technology developed by QIAGEN and we're using it to expand our QIAseq portfolio for next-generation sequencing across DNA, RNA and micro RNA. Digital NGS is clearly a differentiating technology that we can offer for use in many applications. And we also see here a market opportunity of more than $100 million. The third area involves single cell analysis, which is also a very promising application for next-generation sequencing. QIAGEN has taken a strong position as a leader in helping researchers overcome challenges to improve our understanding of whole genomes and gene regulation from single cells. Challenges here are rooted in the limited amount of sample material and data that can currently be generated. We are launching new and completely PCR-free workflows for use with DNA and RNA that start with the cell and go through to the DNA library step for use on any NGS platform. These kits leverage a unique multiplication method and an efficient library construction technology to prepare highly accurate sequencing. And this is a big step for QIAGEN into another $100 million market opportunity. I'm now on Slide 9 to give you a closer look at our new proprietary digital NGS technology, which aims to show you why we're excited about this innovative addition to our growing portfolio of QIAseq universal NGS panels. Industry experts confirm that the existing solutions for NGS panel design are far from perfect. The efficiency and effectiveness of the current workflows have been hampered by problems in the early workflow stages, such as the formation of PCR duplicates during amplification, and also general amplification bias due to non-uniform PCR reactions. These key issues are addressed through the new proprietary molecular index technology. This technology was developed by QIAGEN and makes use of molecular indices that are attached to discrete DNA molecules during the initial target enrichment step. This means the indices can be recognized at a later stage and referenced to the original target DNA molecules, and the specific indices can be quantified with maximum high resolution power. Accurate differentiation and quantification of specific DNA molecules is very important for many NGS applications, such as gene analysis, gene expression analysis, and variant analysis. This addition of digital sequencing based on molecular indices to the QIAseq portfolio provides our customers with a sample-to-insight technology package across DNA, RNA and micro for use on any sequencer. As a last and important point, we will transfer the molecular index technology to the GeneReader NGS system to further enhance the performance benefits of this workflow. I am now on Slide 10 to review our progress in terms of commercialization and content development for the GeneReader NGS system, which is our complete sample-to-insight next-generation sequencing workflow. At the recent ASCO meeting in Chicago we added liquid biopsy as a sample type option for our QIAact actionable insights tumor panel, which is the first in a family of panels designed for use on the GeneReader system. This is the first targeted gene sequencing panel that can be used with either liquid biopsy or tissue samples. Also at ASCO we announced the formation of the Lung Cancer Expert Alliance. This is a consortium of world-leading pathologists and clinicians in the field of lung cancer who have joined together to guide and advise QIAGEN in the selection of content and design of new panels and workflows. We appreciate this support since it will be highly valuable in developing the GeneReader sample-to-insight workflow and related solutions for use in lung cancer. The launch of GeneReader is progressing in Europe and the United States, and we have now expanded commercialization to the Asia-Pacific region. We have also expanded our roadmap for system improvements and more content. In addition to the previous announced plans for new content solutions related to breast and lung cancer, we intend to add new solutions to blood-based cancers in gene expression signatures. Furthermore, all of the upcoming panels will feature our new digital sequencing NGS technology. We are very pleased with the positive customer feedback on the GeneReader and we will keep you updated on our progress during this first year. With that I would like to hand over to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. Good afternoon to everyone in Europe and good morning to those of you joining from the U.S. I am Slide 11 to review our financial performance for the second quarter and first half of 2016, as well as our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. As Peer mentioned earlier, the results for the second quarter were actually ahead of our targets, and the performance of the first half of 2016 has strengthened our confidence in achieving the goals we have set for the full year. For the second quarter, net sales grew 6% at constant exchange rates, and this was faster than our target for 4% constant exchange rate growth due in particular to the high single-digit constant exchange rate growth in our three life science customer classes, especially pharma at 9% constant exchange rate, and applied testing at 10% after rebounding from a weaker trend in the first quarter. About 1 percentage point of total constant exchange rate growth came from the late 2015 acquisition of MO BIO, but the rest of the portfolio provided 5 percentage points. This was an important step up from the 1 percentage point of the year-on year organic growth seen in the first quarter of 2016. At actual rates, net sales rose US$334 million based on one point of currency headwind. Moving down the income statement, adjusted operating income declined 12% in the second quarter. As we set out for this year, we plan for significant incremental investments during the first half to enhance our mid to long term growth prospects. This was expected to weigh on the adjusted operating income margin for the first half of 2016, which was 19% of sales compared to 24% in the first half of 2015, but we expect to see better year-on-year trends in the second half, by the full-year margin in 2016 to be at about the same level as 2015. In line with our plan, the adjusted operating income margin was 21% of sales in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 25% for the same period in 2015. Also keep in mind that the results for the second quarter of 2016 was a sequential quarterly increase of 3 percentage points from the 18% adjusted operating income margin in the first quarter of the year. The adjusted gross margin was 70% of sales compared to 71% in the year-ago period. And we continue to anticipate a full-year margin at this level. As anticipated, sales and marketing expenses were higher as a percentage of sales, and this was mainly for incremental investments such as adding sales representatives for QuantiFERON TB and in the life science market. Other areas have included some investments for GeneReader commercialization and regional expansion activities such as in Asia and the Middle East. R&D investments were also higher as a percentage of sales, in part to accelerate content development for the GeneReader system and further expand our life science portfolio. General and administration costs were also slightly higher as a percentage of sales in the quarter, in part due to the higher cost to expand our digital capability. You can see that we have reached an important inflection point for the sales growth projectory, and this has been supported by the incremental investments. Now we are shifting greater attention to normalizing the cost base in order to find more productivity gains in the coming quarters. Moving further down the income statement, adjusted earnings per share were $0.24, and this was ahead of our target for $0.22 and reflects the contributions from top-line growth and cost management measures in the second quarter of 2016. The adjusted tax rate was 16% for the second quarter, in line with our target. Moving to slide 12, I would like to provide you with an overview of the customer classes and their performances in the second quarter and the first half of 2016. As noted earlier, the acquisition of MO BIO in late 2015 supported underlying growth in all customer classes for the first half of the year. The Exiqon acquisition was completed on June 28 and the sales consolidation began as of July 1, so we will only see that contribution for the second half. Our sales to academic customers in the second quarter of 2016 was 6% constant exchange rate growth on the back of marketing initiatives and new product launches. We have been adding specialists in the field to support our sales reps, and this came against a backlog of improving customer sentiment and the public funding levels in the US. We also saw better sentiment in Europe but customers were not as optimistic as in the US. We continue to expect an acceleration in demand in the second half of the year as more funding is released. Pharma was clearly a bright spot, moving along at a dynamic 9% constant exchange rate pace in the second quarter against a very strong quarterly performance in 2015, and also achieving 8% constant exchange rate growth for the first half of 2016. Our sales reps are placing greater focus at this time when pharma and biotech companies are stepping up R&D investment. Here we saw double-digit constant exchange rate growth during the second quarter in instrument sales. After a weak start into the year, applied testing sales rose 10% constant exchange rate and bounced back in the second quarter of 2016 with strong double-digit constant exchange rate growth in instrument sales. This customer class can be volatile and we continue to expect full-year growth at high single-digit constant exchange rates. In molecular diagnostics, we also saw better trends with a 4% constant exchange rate sales gain in the second quarter, as our growth drivers, in particular the QuantiFERON TB test, the infectious disease portfolio, and QIAsymphony automation system consumables supported the underlying 8% constant exchange rate growth in this customer class that excludes US HPV sales. These results also absorbed lower revenues from core development project revenues for companion diagnostics. I am now on Slide 13 to review our sales on a geographic basis. All regions delivered solid performances for the second quarter and the first half of the year. And we continue to generate rapid growth in the top seven emerging markets. This group of countries at 20% constant exchange rate growth in the second quarter and represented 16% of total sales. The Americas region had 3% constant exchange rate growth in the second quarter but reached a faster 6% constant exchange rate when excluding US HPV test sales, thanks to better trends among life science customers, particularly in the US, while and Mexico and Brazil also delivered growth. In the U.S., the QuantiFERON latent TB test grew above the global 25% constant exchange rate pace, and underpinned better molecular diagnostics results. In the Europe, Middle East, Africa region, sales were 13% constant exchange rate in the second quarter and provided about one-third of sales. This region benefited from strong growth in molecular diagnostics, and this was across all our portfolio, with QuantiFERON TB, QIAsymphony and personal healthcare companion diagnostic kits. Germany, the United Kingdom and Switzerland all delivered single-digit constant exchange rate growth, while Spain showed acceleration and Turkey again had double-digit constant exchange rate growth against weaker trends in Italy. Another catalyst for sales were from the expansion efforts we are making in the Middle East. Our ambition is to capture more opportunities that will be supported through a stronger [di-eg] presence through a new QIAGEN team in Dubai. In the Asia-Pacific and Japan region we again saw two different trends during the second quarter. We saw another significant double-digit constant exchange rate sales drop in Japan, which faces ongoing micro-challenges, but we expect better trends in the second half of the year. At the same time the rest of the region grew about 15% constant exchange rate, led by China, maintaining a pace above 10% constant exchange rate growth in the second quarter. Solid performances also came from Australia, India, Singapore, and South Korea, and we are [from] our investment in these attractive markets. Moving to Slide 14 I would like to give you an update on our balance sheet and cash flows. We are particularly pleased with the cash flow generation in the second quarter as free cash flow grew 75% to $108 million for the first half of the year. This was due to a significant improvement in drop in capital and a drop in the numbers of days of sales outstanding for our DSOs to below 70 for the quarter. These trends helped to support the increased commitment to return $300 million of capital to shareholders. In terms of liquidity and leverage, the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remains favorable at 1.7 times. Even with a new capital return plan, we see the level remaining below three times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, and that is due to the strong cash flow generation from our business. I'm now on Slide 15 for an update on the commitment to increase returns to shareholders. This is based on the more than $500 million of capital we have returned since 2012 through the purchase of our own shares and dilutive securities. This has included about $270 million returned to date through the three first share repurchase programs. We also removed about 5 million from the diluted share count, and also the overhand of an additional 5 million shares of dilution through the repurchase of convertible notes in 2015. The $300 million of returns incorporates the $100 million share repurchase that we announced in April 2016 and did not yet initiate due to the macro concerns, such as Brexit. The first tranche is expected to be $200 million and completed in early 2017, with remaining $100 million during next year. This is based on our conviction about the directive trend change and significant value creation opportunity at QIAGEN. Will keep you updated on our plans about the topic. I am now on Slide 16 to review our net sales and adjusted EPS targets for the full year. In light of the Exiqon acquisition, we have updated this target to about 6% to 7% constant exchange rate for the full-year sales growth. This is based on adding about $10 million of first time sales from the Exiqon acquisition in the second half of the year of our prior year full-year guidance for about 6% constant exchange rate sales growth. Moving to adjusted EPS, our guidance remains for about $1.10 to $1.11 per share on the full-year basis for 2016. The Exiqon acquisition is expected to have a neutral impact on adjusted EPS in 2016. This outlook does not take into account any shares that could be repurchased in the second half of the year. As a last point, our guidance is based on constant exchange rates. However, we also provide estimates about potential currency impact. Based on rates as of July 1st, we now expect pressure of about 1 to 2 percentage points on the full-year constant exchange rate sales target and about $0.01 to $0.02 per share on the full-year adjusted EPS guidance at constant exchange rate. Moving to Slide 17, I would like to provide some more details and assumptions for our outlook for the third quarter of 2016 and the full year. For the third quarter, our target is net sales growth of about 8% to 9% at constant exchange rates. This takes into account about 1 percentage points of headwind from declining U.S. HPV test sales, but also includes an estimated $5 million of incremental sales from Exiqon for the quarter. And to reiterate my earlier point, we expect operating income margin for 2016 to be at a similar level as 2015. That is due to our plans for this year for costs to roll back to a more normalized level following the incremental investment we made in the first half of the year. For adjusted EPS, we have set a target for about $0.28 per share at constant exchange rates, and this compares to $0.27 in the third quarter of 2015. This slide also contains adjustment assumptions for the third quarter and the full year. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter is expected to be 16%. No changes have been made to the full year adjusted tax rate of 16% to 17%. With that, I would like to hand back to Peer. Peer Schatz Thank you, Roland. I am now slide 18 for a summary before we move into Q&A. Let me review what we have announced. First, we had a solid performance in the second quarter, exceeding our targets for net sales and adjusted EPS, while also generating a 75% increase in free cash flow. Our sales results for the first half of 2016 present the same distribution of sales as they have for the first half of 2015. And we are also on the right path to achieving our adjusted EPS targets for the full year. Second, our results for the second quarter show QIAGEN has reached an inflection point for a new sales growth trajectory, and we're determined to improve profitability as this momentum gains traction. We are moving ahead on initiatives to continue this acceleration. Third, we have increased our commitment to now return $300 million of capital to shareholders. This reflects our conviction that we are facing an attractive trend change and significant value creation opportunity. And as a last point, we have updated our full-year 2016 guidance for the addition of Exiqon to our portfolio. We continue to expect a record year of net sales and adjusted earnings per share at constant exchange rates estrogen prepares for more growth and 2017 and the coming years. With that, I'd like to hand back to the operator for the Q&A session. Thank you. Question-And-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead sir.  Vijay Kumar Hi, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe one big picture question and one follow up on the financial piece. Peer, it looks like the language around GeneReader, it seems to be a lot more positive. If I just look for the last few quarters, every quarter I feel like you guys are coming in ahead of plan internally. That's what it feels like to us. I just wonder, what is driving that enthusiasm around GeneReader? And any comments, I know you have an ongoing IT dispute or any update on when we can get a resolution or what it means. Peer Schatz Sure. Our customers are seeing in the GeneReader sample to insight workflow, a truly differentiated solution. It differentiates in terms of the way the content has been designed, the way the system is integrated from sample to insight, with all components and reagents coming from one source. this is embedded in a support and service system that allows customers to meet their highest demands in those regards. And a very attractive economic model, the price per insight model. As we can combine all these workflow elements, we can therefore offer the PPI -- price per insight-- model that is also being seen at customers as very attractive. We have seen this resonate very well with customers. And you have probably seen first customer statements out there and first presentations being made at conferences where this is also being reiterated by customers. We will see more of that going forward. We have prepared this very carefully and we are very diligently rolling this out, and the trajectory is very exciting and one that we will continue to comment on going forward. In terms of the other topic that you mentioned, obviously next-generation sequencing is an area where a lot of intellectual property comes to play. There are many lawsuits in this space, as well. Obviously you are familiar with the lawsuits that resulted out of the Columbia lawsuits against Illumina that also now impacted us as a collateral. This is something, obviously, in an ongoing intellectual property lawsuit. We would not want to comment in a more detailed way. The date and the motions for preliminary injunctions are publicly available. But, remember, we are very confident about our position. And this litigation is also limited to the United States. We have very proudly launched the system and are very confident about our position to market it very aggressively going forward and around the globe. And we're looking forward to report on this trajectory as we move forward. Operator The next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve Beuchaw Peer, as we reflect back on the quarter, you entered the quarter with a view that we should see steady progress throughout the year. It seems like what you saw here in the second quarter was a bit surprising on the positive side to you. So, I wonder, as you look at the matrix of products and execution, if you could spike out for us the one or two things that you thought in the quarter were the most material upside surprises. And then for Roland, just a couple of clarifications, on Exiqon, the 10 million impact for the second half of the year was a little smaller than I might have expected. Can you walk us through how we get to the 10. And then any commentary on forward expectations for improvement in working capital would be really helpful. Thanks so much. Peer Schatz Thank you, Steve. I think to the first question, before I hand over to Roland, clearly over the last few years we focused very heavily on building a very exciting portfolio that included next-gen sequencing. We built up the QuantiFERON franchise and a lot of other things, in particular, as you now see, in the life sciences. We are moving through the pipeline and there is more to come. Starting about a year ago, we significantly increased our efforts on commercialization of some of the existing growth drivers and also the infrastructure around the GeneReader launch. This clearly moved our operating expenses up as we were boosting the revenue trajectories. In the second quarter we now saw that those revenue trajectories are building. We had projected them, we were planning cautiously, and they came in very well in the second quarter, and especially also with a very strong foundation for the second half of the year. This was one of the great highlights for us because, clearly now, we are focused on making sure that the operating expenditures as a percentage of sales are going to start seeing more operating leverage as that trajectory continues and we can go from boost mode to maintenance mode, admittedly at a high growth rate at the top line. So, this is probably one of the highlights I would point to in the second quarter. And we were cautious about that. We had been building it and planning it for quite some time, obviously, and this was part of our guidance early in the year. But to see that flow through is definitely something I would point to at this point. Roland? Roland Sackers Yes. Thanks. The two question -- Exiqon, the $10 million for the roll out, this was half and half in the third and fourth quarter. It might be a bit lower, as you have expected, because a significant part also of Exiqon business is actually a service business, like service businesses, and we are focusing on what again they are bringing to QIAGEN, especially around the product. And that is something which makes a difference. And have in mind what we are expecting for 2017 is actually double-digit constant exchange rate growth, also, from that business, so I think is impact around the service business. On the working capital side, we still expect a further improvement going forward. Clearly the 75% improvement in the second quarter, I think, was a very good indication on what is possible. DSO, I think being now below 70 days is a comfortable area. I would rather expect also, on the inventory side to see here some further improvement. We were clearly building up, as we talked about, some increased, additional inventory for certain product launches we did, but also for certain product tranches we did from site to site. I think we can now phase it down over the time, so that should have some impact, as well. Operator Your next question comes from Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Scott Bardo First question just relates to some of the novel launches that you highlight for 2016, the digital NGS and some of the cell single analysis work, which look interesting. What I'm trying to understand, actually, is how reliant, so to say, are these new launches on the patent estate that is being questioned or under litigation. Are the potential growth contributions from these areas subject to the existing next generation sequencing biosynthesis, which you saw in this legal discussion of the moment? Or are these completely separate IPs that you will still be able to actually commercialize regardless of that outcome? That's a long winded question, number one, please. Question number two just relates to the companion diagnostics part of the business. I think I remember back three or four years ago this business growing very nicely, 15%, 20% plus. But the last couple of years, all of a sudden, the end of last year and this year -- has been a bit disappointing. And I appreciate there's some volatility in these milestone payments but that does not correlate necessarily with the success you have had there. So, can you give us some midterm outlook, the way you see this business growing? Has growth materially slowed or are we back to historic levels? Peer Schatz Sure. The first question, very easy answer. No dependency on any intellectual property that is currently under dispute. I would like to highlight, that is a very small area of intellectual property that is under dispute. So, it is not impact in any way, either on our revenue outlook or on new product introduction capabilities.  Number two is, the personalized healthcare franchise, again the companion diagnostic service revenues, which is basically a CRO and we disclosed the number now for last year was about $35 million in sales that we had last year. That comes from dozens of programs that we're doing with pharma companies, multiyear programs typically. As we are increasingly moving earlier into the pipeline we're getting more volatility on these milestones, meaning that there is more attribution. We have seen more attrition, actually, in the first half of the year. You probably saw a lot in the news, as well of programs that we are associated with. As companion diagnostics typically require, in most cases we are associated in some way or the other. This is an area where we, in terms of revenue, are not really so focused on this being a contributor of profitability because it is profitable. We can match it with the expected expenses in a very short timeframe and have a full pipeline of projects. But going forward we would not expect that piece to grow materially. It will probably broaden in the portfolio, it might grow a little bit, but I wouldn't put a lot of strategic or value on that. It's valued at as a CRO basically and as risk mitigation that we ask for when we go into these partnership for pharma, as we're taking risk for their pharma drugs. Going forward, we're focused on the revenue from the kits. And that is, obviously if we believe in personalized medicine, which we clearly do, this is a very attractive area and we are seeing a pretty good pipeline. We might actually see first products come through later this year, certainly in 2017. Operator The next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel Okay, thank you very much. Good day, gentlemen. Peer, my first question is for you and it's on core sample prep. Commentary in your prepared remarks was a bit better than we have heard from you for a while. I think you talked about sample prep technologies growing at a solid single-digit pace in the quarter. I think it is fair to say that this has not grown a whole lot faster than low single digits over the last several quarters. I am just wondering if you could talk about what your expectation is for the full year, and, maybe more importantly, how we should think about this significant portion of your portfolio in 2017 and beyond. You clearly have some very exciting growth drivers. That said, two-thirds of your revenue or so is still legacy products. If sample growth picks up, that could really move the needle, I think in a big way. So, I'm just wondering if you could comment on how you are thinking about that. And then, sorry for the long one there, a quick second question for Roland. Keeping in mind the share repurchase program and the Exiqon deal, I just want to make sure that I heard you right when you said you expect net leverage to remain below 3 times through the end of 2017. I just want to make sure we have that right as we think about your appetite for additional potential strategic activity over the next one to two years. Thank you. Peer Schatz Sure. Sample technologies are an integral part of what we call the sample-to-insight experience that we give to customers. And we are increasingly seeing that being used in an integrated way, starting from a sample and then ultimately ending up with an insight that can be generated using our bioinformatics capabilities. The sample technologies per se are a cross-section across all customer classes. I often see that misinterpreted as a pure life sciences area. That is definitely not the case. Our sample technologies are used in diagnostics and used in -- take, for instance, NIPT, where we have very strong positions in sample technologies. It is a smaller market segment but that is clearly a more clinical application where a sample technology solution is being used. We're getting growth. It was always a growing franchise. We have now over the last few years rejuvenated the portfolio, created a lot more products, similar to what we saw today with the sample technologies for cell-free DNA but also the microbiome technology single-cell sample technologies that are in areas that are getting a lot more research. Starting 2011, what we saw was basically a significant shift of the applications. If you go through the NIH grant profiles you will see that the shift was away from more traditional research into next-generation sequencing and clinical research. That is a shift that we followed and prepared. And some of the things you are seeing now is the fruit of these initiatives that we created as the shift became more and more visible. It actually happened very quickly and you see that also in the growth profiles of some of the other companies in this space. We are well-positioned with a nice portfolio now, focusing on clinical applications and even traditional product, what you call legacy product. They are very often improved with new protocols and new white papers that provide now capabilities and proof of principle, or validity, even, for some of these newer fast-growing segments. Roland? Roland Sackers Yes. The question on [indiscernible] I think what we said, what you got right in terms of ratios on adjusted EBITDA. But I think what is important for us, I think is an extension of our commitment that we allocate our profitability fairly between the return to shareholders and at the same time keeping flexibility also for bolt-on acquisitions for QIAGEN. I think looking forward now, on the basis of Q2 is I actually feel very comfortable that now in 2016 and also especially in 2017 our profitability, also cash flow generation, goes in the right way. And we will give you more insight on that probably on our analysis day. That is something which we do believe, this is $300 million we have, we are doing exactly that, giving us allocation on keeping the flexibility where, at the same time, stepping up returns to shareholders. Operator Next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Jack Meehan I have two questions on QuantiFERON. Could you just give us an update, timeline, which you anticipate for warning letter in ideation? Do you believe the issues have been addressed with the new manufacturing in-house and the quality systems? And then, just as you look through your end in the U.S., what are some of the puts and takes on the growth rate with the salesforce and the USPS DS decision? Thank you. Peer Schatz Sure. First of all, we are taking this very seriously. I would like to point out that we have not received a FDA warning letter in the last at least decade in this space and FDA issues about 100 a year to this industry. That said, that was under the QIAGEN quality system. As we are now moving over the QuantiFERON portfolio to the QIAGEN quality system, as that has now happened, we feel a lot better about that. Nonetheless, we're working very diligently to also deliver the respective requirements. We believe that this will be concluded at some point possibly later this year. But, remember, very often these processes don't have an official closing. But we think we are on a good path and we have all of the resources on it to make that happen as quickly as possible. In terms of the QuantiFERON commercialization, you clearly see that customers are very excited about this product. And we have seen growth rates spike actually considerably, in particular in North America. This is also where we significantly increased the commercialization efforts are putting this in a more long term trajectory. Remember, when customers adopted these technologies, they typically try and adopt it at a certain run rate, and then the standards are validated within such an institution, you get into a more long term growth rate. And this is something we're starting to see now with the first institutions and moving it forward as aggressively as possible. The trajectory is very exciting for QuantiFERON around the world, I have to say, also based on some of the new evidences that we were able to demonstrate in scientific publications. Operator The next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Please go ahead sir. Brian Weinstein You had some upside that developed this quarter but you left the total range the same, outside of actually first. So, can you talk about, was there anything that was pulled forward a little bit in the quarter? Is there a different outlook somewhere or are you just being conservative? And then a second question financially is, at what point of CER for you guys do we really start to see leverage? Is it a consistent 7%? Is it 8%? I think it used to be 5%, 6% but we haven't seen that leverage yet. At what point of CER do we really start seeing some leverage? Peer Schatz The question, if we look at 2016, it is really slowly where we want to deliver on the full-year numbers. This is why we keep on pointing to the full-year targets that we set. They are the same that we set at the beginning of the year, the same that we reiterated at the end of the first quarter, and we are continuing on this path. We were able to show that the path is a doable path. 47% of revenues came in, in the first half of 2016 comparable to what we had in the first half of 2015. So, from that perspective, our focus is really on the end of year number, and this is why we are maintaining that focus also in terms of our guidance at this point. Roland, do you want to take the second? Roland Sackers Yes. The second is actually an easy answer. You will see that in the third and fourth quarter already. As I said, we clearly were very straight earlier this year when we gave also guidance for 2016 as we said that we had incremental, on what we wanted to do incremental investments the first part of the year. That is done and we have seen the impact of that already quite early now already in the second quarter. At the same time, now, we are expecting leverage to come back to that inflection point on profitability, and going to start most likely in the third quarter on the move from there. The margin side, I think we gave a clear indication of what we said before. But you will see the sequential improvement coming up. Operator Next question comes from line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro Hi, guys. Thank you. You didn't spend a lot of time in the prepared remarks on informatics, bioinformatics. I was just curious what the growth was in that business this quarter and in the outlook for the back half. Peer Schatz Sure. Obviously we wanted to focus on a few of the other things, as a lot happened in some of the other portfolios. We did have some interesting launches in RNAseq in the second quarter. This is a very important area of research and also increasingly clinical use. In this franchise our focus this year is on the QIAGEN Clinical Insight's rollout. We are seeing very good adoption and some also great expansions in terms of networks that originally adopted this technology. What we are currently focusing on is the integration of that into GeneReader and sample to insight workflows. So, that business, which, as you remember, is somewhere in the range of 4% of our sales, is developed on plan in the first half of the quarter, and we have a solid outlook. Operator The next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Dan Arias Thanks for the question. Roland, maybe just clarifying on your OpEx comments, what percentage of the incremental investments that you're making for the year were made in the first half? It sounds like it's a vast majority but it would be great to put a number around. And then if we think about the profitability step up in the back half, do you see margins being relatively similar in 3Q and 4Q, or do you think we should think more about a sequential ramping for the end of the year? Roland Sackers You will see also a ramping over the quarter of year, so I would probably, again, if you look on the guidance and what we said for the third quarter, that probably converts in an adjusted EBITDA margin around 24 for the third quarter and probably going up to the 30 percentage ratio for the fourth quarter. And that is clearly the way we look at it right now. And on the cost side, as we said, the incremental costs we launched was heavily loaded, as you said, in the first two quarters. The larger part of them will just not re-occur on launch events we had on internal trainings, we had certain things which in that regard will not re-occur in that magnitude given all the launches, for example, we had end of last year, earlier this year. So, you will see that absolute dollar cost for certain operation expenses will even decrease in the third and the fourth quarter. And if you just do the calculation on more or less taking the expected revenue growth in the third and fourth quarter, a slight improvement, as we indicated, on the gross margin side, and put in a slight reduction, even just a slight reduction operational expenses, you will see that EPS is falling nicely through. Operator Next questions from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Bill Quirk Great. Thanks, good afternoon. Two questions. First off, I would love to hear your thoughts around Japan and specific to the academic and pharma side of the business. And then, secondly, on QuantiFERON -- what is the status of the U.S. federal penal system? I know they were looking at IGRAs as a potential alternative to the skin test. Thank you Peer Schatz Sure. The second question -- definitely the correctional system was an area of prime target of ours that we talked about a few conference calls back. That remains a very attractive area for us. We have been able to penetrate that area in many different institutions and we are seeing a very good uptake of this technology, interestingly enough, because you can test for latent tuberculosis when you have suspects coming in or convicts coming in. And they are, interestingly enough, moved around in the system very quickly thereafter. So, having a test that you can actually do on the same day in a few hours is a big advantage over having to go back to the person two days later to do an inspection. So, from that perspective we are seeing quite a good uptick. And the first question was -- again? Bill Quirk The first question was just to comment on Japan with specific to the academic and pharma markets. Peer Schatz Japan -- thanks for pointing this one out, though -- is, indeed, an extremely difficult market at the moment, and one where most industry players are seeing a significant decline, even, in their business. We saw about also in the second quarter. There is an outlook for that to improve over the next 12 to 18 months. We think we have put this on a better footing, now that we have found somewhat of a floor in the second quarter. But the industry is still very wobbly. Despite all these stimulus packages and everything that was talked about, it remains a very difficult market. A lot of these stimuli did not really go into areas that had direct implications for molecular biology, or at least the research of the clinical applications that we are working on. We are seeing some light at the end of the tunnel based on country-specific and company-specific activities that we did. But it remains a market that is definitely dilutive to growth, top-line growth, probably for the course of this year. Operator Next question comes from the line of Peter Welford of Jefferies. Peter Welford Thanks for taking my question. It's actually on the capital return program. I wonder if you could outline whether you specifically cited that the extra $200 million will be returned as a share buyback, or are there other options also on the cards, either potentially a Dutch auction tender process, or even a special dividend or other process? Or is this very definitely a share buyback program that will be executed in a similar manner. And then, secondly, as a follow-up to that, also I was wondering what was it that particularly drove this decision now/ Perhaps you can comment on what you're seeing now in the M&A landscape at the moment in terms of deal values, valuations and your feeling on how that's panning out at present. Thank you. Roland Sackers To answer the second part of your question first, I don't think it has to do with anything what you see right now, the landscape on valuation, on targets available or not. I think it just fully to do with that we are seeing a significant step up for us in the second quarter in cash flow generation, giving us confidence for the second part of the year and also for 2017. Again, we are giving you more insights on our analyst day around that. And therefore we saw it the right time to stick to our commitment, what we have given earlier, which as I said, is also a allocation part within our profitability. And that is exactly what we are doing here. So, we think it has been also our obligation to say that we are going to again give $300 million incremental back then to our shareholders for the end of 2017. We have not decided yet exactly how we want to do it. As you know, under Dutch law there is a certain, different opportunities, there's different limitation, so we have to regular onset. We clearly do have a preference around share buyback right now. Peer Schatz To the first part of the question, Peter, we believe that we have a lot of things organically currently that are very exciting. We did two acquisitions, one in the life science area. Actually the last two years there were four acquisitions in this space. The pipeline is really good internally organically. And in addition to that we filled a few very nice additional pieces in. Our focus is really on executing and pulling that through into also operating leverage going forward and that remains the focus. Definitely there are always attractive opportunities out there, but if you look at the trajectory over the last few years, it has typically been in the sub $100 million space. The Company continues to have firepower to do these types of transactions but we are definitely more focused now on organic execution on the portfolio that we have. Operator The last question comes from Jan Keppeler of HSBC. Please go ahead sir. Jan Keppeler Only a quick question on the QuantiFERON business. I think the last time we have touched on the topic of potential additional competition for this franchise. You mentioned that you do not have any indication that someone is currently working on anything competitive, which basically means then that any potential market entry is built on what longer down the road, maybe a couple of years. I think I am just looking for a confirmation of that. Is this still the case or has changed anything in the meanwhile, given the increasingly attractive market? Peer Schatz I think latent TB testing is, indeed, a very attractive market. And certainly other technologies are being looked at to be able to identify, for instance, gene signatures or other patterns that could be related to latent TB testing. But for screening assays, it takes a very long time to validate these things and there is just phenomenal data on QuantiFERON, looking at the data points that we have. And it is just a very slick and very cost effective and efficient assay that we have. Therefore, I think there are a lot of benefits that customers see in our product that make this one that is very competitive in the long term. Yet, we are in a high technology space. We are definitely also monitoring other areas and looking at other approaches to this and adjacent assays, and building the overall QuantiFERON related franchise in addition to just focusing on TB.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead sir.  Vijay Kumar Hi, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe one big picture question and one follow up on the financial piece. Peer, it looks like the language around GeneReader, it seems to be a lot more positive. If I just look for the last few quarters, every quarter I feel like you guys are coming in ahead of plan internally. That's what it feels like to us. I just wonder, what is driving that enthusiasm around GeneReader? And any comments, I know you have an ongoing IT dispute or any update on when we can get a resolution or what it means. Peer Schatz Sure. Our customers are seeing in the GeneReader sample to insight workflow, a truly differentiated solution. It differentiates in terms of the way the content has been designed, the way the system is integrated from sample to insight, with all components and reagents coming from one source. this is embedded in a support and service system that allows customers to meet their highest demands in those regards. And a very attractive economic model, the price per insight model. As we can combine all these workflow elements, we can therefore offer the PPI -- price per insight-- model that is also being seen at customers as very attractive. We have seen this resonate very well with customers. And you have probably seen first customer statements out there and first presentations being made at conferences where this is also being reiterated by customers. We will see more of that going forward. We have prepared this very carefully and we are very diligently rolling this out, and the trajectory is very exciting and one that we will continue to comment on going forward. In terms of the other topic that you mentioned, obviously next-generation sequencing is an area where a lot of intellectual property comes to play. There are many lawsuits in this space, as well. Obviously you are familiar with the lawsuits that resulted out of the Columbia lawsuits against Illumina that also now impacted us as a collateral. This is something, obviously, in an ongoing intellectual property lawsuit. We would not want to comment in a more detailed way. The date and the motions for preliminary injunctions are publicly available. But, remember, we are very confident about our position. And this litigation is also limited to the United States. We have very proudly launched the system and are very confident about our position to market it very aggressively going forward and around the globe. And we're looking forward to report on this trajectory as we move forward. Operator The next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve Beuchaw Peer, as we reflect back on the quarter, you entered the quarter with a view that we should see steady progress throughout the year. It seems like what you saw here in the second quarter was a bit surprising on the positive side to you. So, I wonder, as you look at the matrix of products and execution, if you could spike out for us the one or two things that you thought in the quarter were the most material upside surprises. And then for Roland, just a couple of clarifications, on Exiqon, the 10 million impact for the second half of the year was a little smaller than I might have expected. Can you walk us through how we get to the 10. And then any commentary on forward expectations for improvement in working capital would be really helpful. Thanks so much. Peer Schatz Thank you, Steve. I think to the first question, before I hand over to Roland, clearly over the last few years we focused very heavily on building a very exciting portfolio that included next-gen sequencing. We built up the QuantiFERON franchise and a lot of other things, in particular, as you now see, in the life sciences. We are moving through the pipeline and there is more to come. Starting about a year ago, we significantly increased our efforts on commercialization of some of the existing growth drivers and also the infrastructure around the GeneReader launch. This clearly moved our operating expenses up as we were boosting the revenue trajectories. In the second quarter we now saw that those revenue trajectories are building. We had projected them, we were planning cautiously, and they came in very well in the second quarter, and especially also with a very strong foundation for the second half of the year. This was one of the great highlights for us because, clearly now, we are focused on making sure that the operating expenditures as a percentage of sales are going to start seeing more operating leverage as that trajectory continues and we can go from boost mode to maintenance mode, admittedly at a high growth rate at the top line. So, this is probably one of the highlights I would point to in the second quarter. And we were cautious about that. We had been building it and planning it for quite some time, obviously, and this was part of our guidance early in the year. But to see that flow through is definitely something I would point to at this point. Roland? Roland Sackers Yes. Thanks. The two question -- Exiqon, the $10 million for the roll out, this was half and half in the third and fourth quarter. It might be a bit lower, as you have expected, because a significant part also of Exiqon business is actually a service business, like service businesses, and we are focusing on what again they are bringing to QIAGEN, especially around the product. And that is something which makes a difference. And have in mind what we are expecting for 2017 is actually double-digit constant exchange rate growth, also, from that business, so I think is impact around the service business. On the working capital side, we still expect a further improvement going forward. Clearly the 75% improvement in the second quarter, I think, was a very good indication on what is possible. DSO, I think being now below 70 days is a comfortable area. I would rather expect also, on the inventory side to see here some further improvement. We were clearly building up, as we talked about, some increased, additional inventory for certain product launches we did, but also for certain product tranches we did from site to site. I think we can now phase it down over the time, so that should have some impact, as well. Operator Your next question comes from Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Scott Bardo First question just relates to some of the novel launches that you highlight for 2016, the digital NGS and some of the cell single analysis work, which look interesting. What I'm trying to understand, actually, is how reliant, so to say, are these new launches on the patent estate that is being questioned or under litigation. Are the potential growth contributions from these areas subject to the existing next generation sequencing biosynthesis, which you saw in this legal discussion of the moment? Or are these completely separate IPs that you will still be able to actually commercialize regardless of that outcome? That's a long winded question, number one, please. Question number two just relates to the companion diagnostics part of the business. I think I remember back three or four years ago this business growing very nicely, 15%, 20% plus. But the last couple of years, all of a sudden, the end of last year and this year -- has been a bit disappointing. And I appreciate there's some volatility in these milestone payments but that does not correlate necessarily with the success you have had there. So, can you give us some midterm outlook, the way you see this business growing? Has growth materially slowed or are we back to historic levels? Peer Schatz Sure. The first question, very easy answer. No dependency on any intellectual property that is currently under dispute. I would like to highlight, that is a very small area of intellectual property that is under dispute. So, it is not impact in any way, either on our revenue outlook or on new product introduction capabilities.  Number two is, the personalized healthcare franchise, again the companion diagnostic service revenues, which is basically a CRO and we disclosed the number now for last year was about $35 million in sales that we had last year. That comes from dozens of programs that we're doing with pharma companies, multiyear programs typically. As we are increasingly moving earlier into the pipeline we're getting more volatility on these milestones, meaning that there is more attribution. We have seen more attrition, actually, in the first half of the year. You probably saw a lot in the news, as well of programs that we are associated with. As companion diagnostics typically require, in most cases we are associated in some way or the other. This is an area where we, in terms of revenue, are not really so focused on this being a contributor of profitability because it is profitable. We can match it with the expected expenses in a very short timeframe and have a full pipeline of projects. But going forward we would not expect that piece to grow materially. It will probably broaden in the portfolio, it might grow a little bit, but I wouldn't put a lot of strategic or value on that. It's valued at as a CRO basically and as risk mitigation that we ask for when we go into these partnership for pharma, as we're taking risk for their pharma drugs. Going forward, we're focused on the revenue from the kits. And that is, obviously if we believe in personalized medicine, which we clearly do, this is a very attractive area and we are seeing a pretty good pipeline. We might actually see first products come through later this year, certainly in 2017. Operator The next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel Okay, thank you very much. Good day, gentlemen. Peer, my first question is for you and it's on core sample prep. Commentary in your prepared remarks was a bit better than we have heard from you for a while. I think you talked about sample prep technologies growing at a solid single-digit pace in the quarter. I think it is fair to say that this has not grown a whole lot faster than low single digits over the last several quarters. I am just wondering if you could talk about what your expectation is for the full year, and, maybe more importantly, how we should think about this significant portion of your portfolio in 2017 and beyond. You clearly have some very exciting growth drivers. That said, two-thirds of your revenue or so is still legacy products. If sample growth picks up, that could really move the needle, I think in a big way. So, I'm just wondering if you could comment on how you are thinking about that. And then, sorry for the long one there, a quick second question for Roland. Keeping in mind the share repurchase program and the Exiqon deal, I just want to make sure that I heard you right when you said you expect net leverage to remain below 3 times through the end of 2017. I just want to make sure we have that right as we think about your appetite for additional potential strategic activity over the next one to two years. Thank you. Peer Schatz Sure. Sample technologies are an integral part of what we call the sample-to-insight experience that we give to customers. And we are increasingly seeing that being used in an integrated way, starting from a sample and then ultimately ending up with an insight that can be generated using our bioinformatics capabilities. The sample technologies per se are a cross-section across all customer classes. I often see that misinterpreted as a pure life sciences area. That is definitely not the case. Our sample technologies are used in diagnostics and used in -- take, for instance, NIPT, where we have very strong positions in sample technologies. It is a smaller market segment but that is clearly a more clinical application where a sample technology solution is being used. We're getting growth. It was always a growing franchise. We have now over the last few years rejuvenated the portfolio, created a lot more products, similar to what we saw today with the sample technologies for cell-free DNA but also the microbiome technology single-cell sample technologies that are in areas that are getting a lot more research. Starting 2011, what we saw was basically a significant shift of the applications. If you go through the NIH grant profiles you will see that the shift was away from more traditional research into next-generation sequencing and clinical research. That is a shift that we followed and prepared. And some of the things you are seeing now is the fruit of these initiatives that we created as the shift became more and more visible. It actually happened very quickly and you see that also in the growth profiles of some of the other companies in this space. We are well-positioned with a nice portfolio now, focusing on clinical applications and even traditional product, what you call legacy product. They are very often improved with new protocols and new white papers that provide now capabilities and proof of principle, or validity, even, for some of these newer fast-growing segments. Roland? Roland Sackers Yes. The question on [indiscernible] I think what we said, what you got right in terms of ratios on adjusted EBITDA. But I think what is important for us, I think is an extension of our commitment that we allocate our profitability fairly between the return to shareholders and at the same time keeping flexibility also for bolt-on acquisitions for QIAGEN. I think looking forward now, on the basis of Q2 is I actually feel very comfortable that now in 2016 and also especially in 2017 our profitability, also cash flow generation, goes in the right way. And we will give you more insight on that probably on our analysis day. That is something which we do believe, this is $300 million we have, we are doing exactly that, giving us allocation on keeping the flexibility where, at the same time, stepping up returns to shareholders. Operator Next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Jack Meehan I have two questions on QuantiFERON. Could you just give us an update, timeline, which you anticipate for warning letter in ideation? Do you believe the issues have been addressed with the new manufacturing in-house and the quality systems? And then, just as you look through your end in the U.S., what are some of the puts and takes on the growth rate with the salesforce and the USPS DS decision? Thank you. Peer Schatz Sure. First of all, we are taking this very seriously. I would like to point out that we have not received a FDA warning letter in the last at least decade in this space and FDA issues about 100 a year to this industry. That said, that was under the QIAGEN quality system. As we are now moving over the QuantiFERON portfolio to the QIAGEN quality system, as that has now happened, we feel a lot better about that. Nonetheless, we're working very diligently to also deliver the respective requirements. We believe that this will be concluded at some point possibly later this year. But, remember, very often these processes don't have an official closing. But we think we are on a good path and we have all of the resources on it to make that happen as quickly as possible. In terms of the QuantiFERON commercialization, you clearly see that customers are very excited about this product. And we have seen growth rates spike actually considerably, in particular in North America. This is also where we significantly increased the commercialization efforts are putting this in a more long term trajectory. Remember, when customers adopted these technologies, they typically try and adopt it at a certain run rate, and then the standards are validated within such an institution, you get into a more long term growth rate. And this is something we're starting to see now with the first institutions and moving it forward as aggressively as possible. The trajectory is very exciting for QuantiFERON around the world, I have to say, also based on some of the new evidences that we were able to demonstrate in scientific publications. Operator The next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Please go ahead sir. Brian Weinstein You had some upside that developed this quarter but you left the total range the same, outside of actually first. So, can you talk about, was there anything that was pulled forward a little bit in the quarter? Is there a different outlook somewhere or are you just being conservative? And then a second question financially is, at what point of CER for you guys do we really start to see leverage? Is it a consistent 7%? Is it 8%? I think it used to be 5%, 6% but we haven't seen that leverage yet. At what point of CER do we really start seeing some leverage? Peer Schatz The question, if we look at 2016, it is really slowly where we want to deliver on the full-year numbers. This is why we keep on pointing to the full-year targets that we set. They are the same that we set at the beginning of the year, the same that we reiterated at the end of the first quarter, and we are continuing on this path. We were able to show that the path is a doable path. 47% of revenues came in, in the first half of 2016 comparable to what we had in the first half of 2015. So, from that perspective, our focus is really on the end of year number, and this is why we are maintaining that focus also in terms of our guidance at this point. Roland, do you want to take the second? Roland Sackers Yes. The second is actually an easy answer. You will see that in the third and fourth quarter already. As I said, we clearly were very straight earlier this year when we gave also guidance for 2016 as we said that we had incremental, on what we wanted to do incremental investments the first part of the year. That is done and we have seen the impact of that already quite early now already in the second quarter. At the same time, now, we are expecting leverage to come back to that inflection point on profitability, and going to start most likely in the third quarter on the move from there. The margin side, I think we gave a clear indication of what we said before. But you will see the sequential improvement coming up. Operator Next question comes from line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro Hi, guys. Thank you. You didn't spend a lot of time in the prepared remarks on informatics, bioinformatics. I was just curious what the growth was in that business this quarter and in the outlook for the back half. Peer Schatz Sure. Obviously we wanted to focus on a few of the other things, as a lot happened in some of the other portfolios. We did have some interesting launches in RNAseq in the second quarter. This is a very important area of research and also increasingly clinical use. In this franchise our focus this year is on the QIAGEN Clinical Insight's rollout. We are seeing very good adoption and some also great expansions in terms of networks that originally adopted this technology. What we are currently focusing on is the integration of that into GeneReader and sample to insight workflows. So, that business, which, as you remember, is somewhere in the range of 4% of our sales, is developed on plan in the first half of the quarter, and we have a solid outlook. Operator The next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Dan Arias Thanks for the question. Roland, maybe just clarifying on your OpEx comments, what percentage of the incremental investments that you're making for the year were made in the first half? It sounds like it's a vast majority but it would be great to put a number around. And then if we think about the profitability step up in the back half, do you see margins being relatively similar in 3Q and 4Q, or do you think we should think more about a sequential ramping for the end of the year? Roland Sackers You will see also a ramping over the quarter of year, so I would probably, again, if you look on the guidance and what we said for the third quarter, that probably converts in an adjusted EBITDA margin around 24 for the third quarter and probably going up to the 30 percentage ratio for the fourth quarter. And that is clearly the way we look at it right now. And on the cost side, as we said, the incremental costs we launched was heavily loaded, as you said, in the first two quarters. The larger part of them will just not re-occur on launch events we had on internal trainings, we had certain things which in that regard will not re-occur in that magnitude given all the launches, for example, we had end of last year, earlier this year. So, you will see that absolute dollar cost for certain operation expenses will even decrease in the third and the fourth quarter. And if you just do the calculation on more or less taking the expected revenue growth in the third and fourth quarter, a slight improvement, as we indicated, on the gross margin side, and put in a slight reduction, even just a slight reduction operational expenses, you will see that EPS is falling nicely through. Operator Next questions from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Bill Quirk Great. Thanks, good afternoon. Two questions. First off, I would love to hear your thoughts around Japan and specific to the academic and pharma side of the business. And then, secondly, on QuantiFERON -- what is the status of the U.S. federal penal system? I know they were looking at IGRAs as a potential alternative to the skin test. Thank you Peer Schatz Sure. The second question -- definitely the correctional system was an area of prime target of ours that we talked about a few conference calls back. That remains a very attractive area for us. We have been able to penetrate that area in many different institutions and we are seeing a very good uptake of this technology, interestingly enough, because you can test for latent tuberculosis when you have suspects coming in or convicts coming in. And they are, interestingly enough, moved around in the system very quickly thereafter. So, having a test that you can actually do on the same day in a few hours is a big advantage over having to go back to the person two days later to do an inspection. So, from that perspective we are seeing quite a good uptick. And the first question was -- again? Bill Quirk The first question was just to comment on Japan with specific to the academic and pharma markets. Peer Schatz Japan -- thanks for pointing this one out, though -- is, indeed, an extremely difficult market at the moment, and one where most industry players are seeing a significant decline, even, in their business. We saw about also in the second quarter. There is an outlook for that to improve over the next 12 to 18 months. We think we have put this on a better footing, now that we have found somewhat of a floor in the second quarter. But the industry is still very wobbly. Despite all these stimulus packages and everything that was talked about, it remains a very difficult market. A lot of these stimuli did not really go into areas that had direct implications for molecular biology, or at least the research of the clinical applications that we are working on. We are seeing some light at the end of the tunnel based on country-specific and company-specific activities that we did. But it remains a market that is definitely dilutive to growth, top-line growth, probably for the course of this year. Operator Next question comes from the line of Peter Welford of Jefferies. Peter Welford Thanks for taking my question. It's actually on the capital return program. I wonder if you could outline whether you specifically cited that the extra $200 million will be returned as a share buyback, or are there other options also on the cards, either potentially a Dutch auction tender process, or even a special dividend or other process? Or is this very definitely a share buyback program that will be executed in a similar manner. And then, secondly, as a follow-up to that, also I was wondering what was it that particularly drove this decision now/ Perhaps you can comment on what you're seeing now in the M&A landscape at the moment in terms of deal values, valuations and your feeling on how that's panning out at present. Thank you. Roland Sackers To answer the second part of your question first, I don't think it has to do with anything what you see right now, the landscape on valuation, on targets available or not. I think it just fully to do with that we are seeing a significant step up for us in the second quarter in cash flow generation, giving us confidence for the second part of the year and also for 2017. Again, we are giving you more insights on our analyst day around that. And therefore we saw it the right time to stick to our commitment, what we have given earlier, which as I said, is also a allocation part within our profitability. And that is exactly what we are doing here. So, we think it has been also our obligation to say that we are going to again give $300 million incremental back then to our shareholders for the end of 2017. We have not decided yet exactly how we want to do it. As you know, under Dutch law there is a certain, different opportunities, there's different limitation, so we have to regular onset. We clearly do have a preference around share buyback right now. Peer Schatz To the first part of the question, Peter, we believe that we have a lot of things organically currently that are very exciting. We did two acquisitions, one in the life science area. Actually the last two years there were four acquisitions in this space. The pipeline is really good internally organically. And in addition to that we filled a few very nice additional pieces in. Our focus is really on executing and pulling that through into also operating leverage going forward and that remains the focus. Definitely there are always attractive opportunities out there, but if you look at the trajectory over the last few years, it has typically been in the sub $100 million space. The Company continues to have firepower to do these types of transactions but we are definitely more focused now on organic execution on the portfolio that we have. Operator The last question comes from Jan Keppeler of HSBC. Please go ahead sir. Jan Keppeler Only a quick question on the QuantiFERON business. I think the last time we have touched on the topic of potential additional competition for this franchise. You mentioned that you do not have any indication that someone is currently working on anything competitive, which basically means then that any potential market entry is built on what longer down the road, maybe a couple of years. I think I am just looking for a confirmation of that. Is this still the case or has changed anything in the meanwhile, given the increasingly attractive market? Peer Schatz I think latent TB testing is, indeed, a very attractive market. And certainly other technologies are being looked at to be able to identify, for instance, gene signatures or other patterns that could be related to latent TB testing. But for screening assays, it takes a very long time to validate these things and there is just phenomenal data on QuantiFERON, looking at the data points that we have. And it is just a very slick and very cost effective and efficient assay that we have. Therefore, I think there are a lot of benefits that customers see in our product that make this one that is very competitive in the long term. Yet, we are in a high technology space. We are definitely also monitoring other areas and looking at other approaches to this and adjacent assays, and building the overall QuantiFERON related franchise in addition to just focusing on TB.

Our speakers today are Peer Schatz, the Chief Executive Officer of QIAGEN; and Roland Sackers, the Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dr. Sarah Fakih from our IR team. You will see in the presentation the standard Safe Harbor statement explaining that the discussion and responses to your questions on this call reflect management's views as of today, November 2, 2016. We will be making statements and providing responses to your questions that state our intentions, beliefs, expectations, or predictions of the future and these constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the Safe Harbor provisions. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. QIAGEN disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We will also be referring on this conference call to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. You can find a reconciliation of these figures in the press release and the presentation for this call. Also, two quick points before I hand over to Peer. First, as you know, our analyst investor day will be held on Tuesday, November 15, in New York. We have changed the times and will now begin with registration at 9:30 AM, start the event at 10:30 AM, and want to end by 3 PM local time. We made this decision after another company in the industry changed its release date and we wanted to help you avoid this conflict. Second, QIAGEN will be at The Association for Molecular Pathology Meeting next week in Charlotte. We plan to hold customer events on Friday in the exhibition hall but will not be participating in the Corporate Day on Wednesday. We will recap our AMP activities at the Analyst Day. With that, I would like to now hand over to Peer. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Yeah, thank you, John. And I would like to welcome all of you to this conference call. Our results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 show QIAGEN's transformation is building momentum and the new sales growth trajectory is taking hold. The benefits of our transformation, which we have acknowledged has taken longer than we expected, are increasingly emerging as a result of our efforts to expand our leadership in molecular testing. We have a unique ability to serve customers along the dynamic continuum from basic research to clinical healthcare and will continue to focus on these opportunities. Let me go through our key messages. First, we delivered on our targets for the third quarter. Net sales rose 9% at constant exchange rates against our guidance of 8% to 9% constant exchange rate growth and were up 8% at actual rates to $338.7 million due to the 1 percentage point of currency headwinds. We had another strong quarter with 10% CER sales growth, excluding the U.S. HPV headwinds. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were at $0.29 at both actual and constant exchange rates, and this was ahead of our target for $0.28. Second, QIAGEN is building momentum in the second half of 2016 and setting a new sales growth trajectory based on our full year target for an increase of about 67% on constant exchange rate basis. The performance for the third quarter was another important step towards achieving our full year sales growth target. All regions grew in the third quarter, backed by gains in Molecular Diagnostics and Life Sciences customer classes and in particular Molecular Diagnostics rising 12% on a CER basis when excluding the U.S. HPV test sales. Our growth drivers are leading the transformation, maintaining a double-digit CER pace and representing about 35% of sales in the third quarter of 2016. An important topic for today is a series of initiatives we have underway to further improve how we operate as an organization after the period of significant investment. We want to align our cost base, better allocate resources to invest for growth and develop an even stronger high performance culture. The related actions include closing two sites, expanding the use of shared service centers, realigning marketing activities within the company and further optimizing our commercial channels, especially greater use of digital opportunities. While planning started earlier in 2016, implementation will now occur during the fourth quarter of 2016 and into 2017. We will take a pre-tax restructuring charge of about $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and also pre-tax charges of about $10 million during 2017 related to these initiatives. In line with our policy, they will be included in adjusted results. We are convinced these actions will help us to support the expected strong sales growth momentum and result in a significant increase in operating leverage. Third, we are moving ahead on our commitment to return $300 million of capital to shareholders by the end of 2017. The first tranche of about $250 million will be completed through the synthetic share repurchase proposal we announced in August and this is on track for completion in January 2017. This type of program which has been used by other large multinational Dutch companies combined a direct capital repayment with a reverse stock split. This proposal received shareholder approval in late October. Our decision to increase returns is the result of our conviction that we are facing an attractive trend change and significant value creation at QIAGEN. And as a final point, we are updating our guidance for 2016 and have provided you an initial indication about sales growth and adjusted earnings for 2017. For 2016, we continue to expect net sales growth of about 6% to 7% on a CER basis and this includes about one percentage point of headwinds from lower U.S. HPV sales. For adjusted diluted EPS, our expectations for 2016 continue to be for the underlying result of about $1.10 to $1.11 per share at constant exchange rates. However, when including new restructuring charge, the full year target is now about $0.87 per share to $0.88 per share at constant exchange rates. I would like to put our sales performance into more context. This slide provides an overview of the year-on-year trends over the last few quarters and years and the trends change are shown at constant exchange rates for the comparable prior periods. We have seen a significant increase in growth rates during the second and third quarters of this year and are anticipating another strong year-on-year growth rate of 8% CER basis in the fourth quarter. However, more important for us is the overall improvement on an annual basis that show the momentum of our portfolio increasing as the headwinds from U.S. HPV sales keep fading as reflected in the lines moving closer together. So our sales growth trajectory is currently about 6% to 7% on a CER basis for this year and shows that QIAGEN is moving in the right direction and bringing the transformation period to an end. I would like to now update you on some of the portfolio developments in the third quarter. Differentiated Technologies refers to solutions we offer that build on our strong franchise in sample preparation which involves a critical first step in any lab process. In the area of liquid biopsy, our teams launched the QIAseq cfDNA All-in-One kit at the recent American Society of Human Genetics meeting. This is the first dedicated solution for use on any next generation sequencing platform that combines cell-free DNA extraction and library preparation for liquid biopsy analysis. It links perfectly to our QIAGEN Clinical Insight bioinformatics solution, for instance for hereditary testing. The QuantiFERON-TB latent TB test had two very important developments recently with the first being a final Grade B recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force for clinicians to screen adult patients and groups at high risk. Also the World Health Organization issued its TB report in October and the fourth generation version got a great mention. The first test results indicate that the CD8 T cell response, which is an innovation for this new generation, may be able to indicate those patients at greater risk of progression to active TB. I would like to now discuss some new product launches for our expanding portfolio in next generation sequencing and also provide an update on the GeneReader NGS System. Since launch last November at the Association for Molecular Pathology meeting, we have seen strong overall demand based on GeneReader's status as the only true, complete Sample to Insight NGS system, and that has been despite the litigation-related challenges in the United States. As you know from our announcement in September, we have accelerated development of selected chemistry components involved in GeneReader after U.S. District Court in California issued a preliminary injunction as part of a patent litigation filed by a competitor that currently prevents us from marketing or selling the system to new customers in the United States. Although we deeply disagree with the court's decision, we are still planning to reach the targets we set for GeneReader in 2016. Customers need a choice and better solutions in clinical sequencing. We are confident of our strong competitive position in this segment and continue to believe in our freedom to operate next generation sequencing in the United States, and our intention remains to return to the United States market during 2017. Outside the U.S., commercialization is gaining momentum amid very positive customer response and we are offering important enhancements to these customers. One of these involves the recent launch of protocols for the use of the QIAsymphony system as a high throughput, very integrated and automated option for sample processing in next generation sequencing up front to the GeneReader. The real value of NGS, regardless of the platform, is the ability to gain actionable and reliable insights through the analysis and interpretation of the massive amounts of sequencing data being generated. Our latest innovation is an enhanced bioinformatics workflow based on QIAGEN's own solutions for hereditary and rare diseases. This offers unique capabilities for customers for instance also using liquid biopsies in non-invasive prenatal testing and cancer biomarker discovery. We have also been significantly expanding our portfolio of universal NGS solutions. As one example, QIAGEN has taken a strong position in the area of single-cell analysis to help researchers overcome challenges and improve our understanding of whole genomes and gene regulation. An important new product launch at ASHG is QIAscout, which is a novel instrument for isolation of variable single cells from samples. This instrument is the size of a handheld mobile device and it will catalyze our Sample to Insight portfolio in research fields such as oncology, immunology, neurobiology and stem cell biology. The breakthrough is that QIAscout enables all scientists to accurately select single cells within minutes through visual control using a standard microscope. The cells remain intact in their natural environment and viable for any downstream application including NGS, PCR, or stem cell/stem line research. This compact and very affordable device integrates with our sample library preparation, panels and bioinformatics to create complete Sample to Insight workflows that help scientists achieve better insights from any sample. We will share more with you about QIAscout and other breakthroughs at our Analyst and Investor Day. And with that, I'd like to hand over to Roland. Roland Sackers - QIAGEN NV Thank you, Peer. Good evening to all of you. On slide eight to review our financial performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 and also to update you on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year as well as provide some initial perspectives on sales and adjusted earnings for 2017. We are continuing to make solid progress on the goals we set for 2016. We are particularly pleased with the faster sales growth in the quarter, the improved adjusted EPS of $0.29 per share compared to the third quarter of 2015, and also the 15% increase in free cash flow for the first nine months of 2016. For the third quarter, net sales was 9% at constant exchange rates and were up 8% to US$338.7 million at actual rates due to 1 point of adverse currency movement. As expected, about 3 percentage points of total constant exchange rate sales growth came from the acquisition of MO BIO which was completed in late 2015 and the acquisition of Exiqon in June 2016. That means we had solid 6% CER organic growth from the rest of the portfolio that even included 1 percentage point of headwind from reduced U.S. HPV test sales. These sales are expected to decline to about $30 million on a full year basis in 2016 and continue to fall further in 2017, but the headwinds are fading. After 1 percentage point of organic growth in the first quarter, we have now had two consecutive quarters at substantially higher sales growth. This reflects the impact of our transformation and the investments we have made to step up commercialization of our growth drivers and expand into new geographic markets. We are looking for a similar organic growth rate at constant exchange rate in the fourth quarter given the guidance for 8% constant exchange rate total growth and for our full year 2016 organic sales growth rate of about 5%. This creates a good foundation to move into 2017. Moving down the income statement, adjusted operating income was 11% in the third quarter, reversing the trends seen in the first two quarters of the year. As we were announced in January, we planned for significant incremental investment during the first half of 2016 to enhance our mid- to long-term growth prospects. We also said that this was expected to reduce the adjusted operating income margin for the first half, but then for expenses to return to more normalized levels in the second half and generating margin benefits. As an outcome, we expected the full year margin 2016 to be about the same as in 2015. In line with our plans, the adjusted operating income margin was 26% of sales in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 25% for the same period in 2015, and we continue to expect a significant increase in the year-on-year margin for the fourth quarter of this year before the restructuring charge. In terms of sequential improvement, the margin for the third quarter is 26% and that compares to 21% level in the second quarter of this year, and even 8 percentage points higher than the 18% margin level in the first quarter. The adjusted gross margin improved by about 60 basis points while remaining at about 71% of sales and we continue to anticipate a full year margin at this level. Here we saw benefits from higher sales of consumables and also some gains from recently shifting manufacturing to our main hubs in Germany and the U.S. from smaller sites and also incremental benefits from insourcing QuantiFERON-TB manufacturing from third parties. Reversing the trend from the first half of the year, sales and marketing expenses were lower as a percentage of sales. We expect them to decline further in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a percentage of sales, and again, this is before the restructuring charge. R&D investments also declined as a percentage of sales, yet we will continue to invest in innovation on a more targeted basis, especially in NGS applications and other areas of our Sample to Insight portfolio. General and administration costs were slightly higher as a percentage of sales in the quarter. This was in part due to higher cost to expand our digital capabilities. After the period of investment, we are shifting greater attention for normalizing the cost base through the efficiency initiatives and we will continue to seek out more efficiency gains in the coming quarters while sustaining the faster sales growth. Moving further down the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.29 and this was ahead of our target for $0.28 and coming mainly from the improvements in adjusted operating income. The adjusted tax rate was 17% for the third quarter and this was higher than our target for about 16%. I would like to now provide you with an overview of the performance among the customer classes. As noted earlier, the acquisitions of MO BIO and Exiqon supported underlying growth in all customer classes and the majority of these sales were in Academia, Pharma and Applied Testing. Sales of products from our portfolio to customers in Molecular Diagnostics was 9% CER and advanced at a 10% constant exchange rate when excluding the headwinds from the U.S. HPV sales. The expansion continues to come from our portfolio of growth drivers that we have built through internal developments as well as targeted M&A. These include the QuantiFERON-TB test, maintaining the new 25% CER, full year sales growth target, double-digit constant exchange rate, growth in consumables used in QIAsymphony, and also solid demand from customers involved in infectious disease testing. In personal healthcare, we saw higher sales of Ipsogen blood cancer tests and significantly higher revenues from co-development projects for companion diagnostics. These milestone revenues can be volatile on a quarterly basis and the year-to-date results show 18% constant exchange rate growth over the same period in 2015. Applied Testing has overcome a weak start to the year with sales up 12% CER in the third quarter and driving 6% CER on a year-to-date basis and closer to the historical solid single-digit CER pace. Sales to these customers rose in the quarter thanks to double-digit CER growth in both consumables and instruments and volume growth in our applications for human ID and forensics. Against the backdrop of slower growth during 2014 and 2015, Pharma has maintained a solid pace this year with sales up 8% constant exchange rate in the third quarter and also on a year-to-date basis. Here we are getting high single-digit CER consumable growth from marketing initiatives and new product launches. In Academia, sales rose 7% CER in the third quarter and were up 5% CER on a year-to-date basis on the back of higher consumable sales, but slightly weaker trends for instruments. We see company-specific factors supporting our trends, especially due to better marketing initiatives and new product launches and also contributions from Exiqon and MO BIO. We continue to see good funding sentiment in the U.S. and expect this to continue in the fourth quarter and 2017. However, we are seeing softer trends in Europe, which is what we have heard from other companies and we continue to take a more conservative view. On a geographic basis, all regions contributed to growth for the third quarter and also on a year-to-date basis. The Americas delivered 11% CER growth with the U.S. growing at the same rate while also absorbing the U.S. HPV headwinds. When excluding this impact, sales in the region rose 14% CER. Key factors were the expansion of the Molecular Diagnostics portfolio, in particular sales, of the QuantiFERON latent TB test and better year-over-year demand from Academia and Applied Testing customers. Brazil also improved to a double-digit CER growth pace after weaker trends in the first half of the year. The Europe / Middle East / Africa region faced a slowdown with sales rising 1% CER in the third quarter but still up 7% CER on a year-to-date basis. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen softer trends among Life Science customers in some countries such as Germany, but at the same time we saw ongoing growth in France and the United Kingdom even with the Brexit situation. We also saw good demand in other areas of the region, in particular with increasing contributions from the Middle East as part of our recent expansion efforts. In the Asia-Pacific / Japan region, we saw a reversal of the trends in the first half of the year as Japan delivered double-digit CER growth in the third quarter. We are seeing better execution from our commercial teams after some management changes at the end of 2015. We also maintained a double-digit CER growth rate in China. Good performance also came from South Korea, Australia and India. As a last point, the top seven emerging markets delivered 20% CER growth in the third quarter and provided 15% of sales. The countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Korea, and Mexico all delivered double-digit CER gains, while Turkey contributed at a higher single-digit CER rate. I would like to now give you an update on our balance sheet and cash flows and also on the plans to return $300 million of capital to shareholders by the end of 2017. As I mentioned earlier, we are particularly pleased with the cash flow generation to-date this year, which is up 15% to $187 million. Thanks to the strong cash flow and also our healthy balance sheet and the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times, we are able to increase returns to shareholders. As part of our new commitment, we announced in August a proposal to return $250 million through a synthetic share repurchase plan that combines a direct capital repayment with a reverse stock split. Shareholders have approved the synthetic share repurchase proposal and we intend to complete it in January 2017 after the expiry of a two-month creditor objection period required by Dutch law. Further details about the conversion ratio and the record payment debt will be announced in January. We intend to return the balance of the $300 million commitment through traditional open market purchases during next year. Even with the new capital return plans which we intend to fund from existing cash reserves, we see the leverage remaining below three times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. I would like to now review our guidance for the full year and that remains for net sales growth of about 6% to 7% at constant exchange rates. This includes about $10 million of first time sales from the Exiqon acquisition in the second half of the year to our prior year full year guidance of about 6% constant exchange rate sales growth. Moving to adjusted EPS, our underlying guidance remains for about $1.10 to $1.11 per share at constant exchange rates on a full year basis for 2016. However, the restructuring charge will be included in adjusted results when we have updated the official guidance to about $0.87 to $0.88 at constant exchange rates. I would like to also provide some estimates about potential currency impacts. Based on the rates as of October 1, we now expect pressure of about 1 percentage point to 2 percentage points of the full year constant exchange rate sales target and about $0.01 per share to $0.02 per share on the full year adjusted EPS guidance at constant exchange rates. We are giving you more details on the assumptions on our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016 and the full year. In terms of net sales, for the fourth quarter we have set a target for about 8% sales growth at constant exchange rates. This is based on solid growth from the current portfolio, which includes about 1 percentage points from the MO BIO acquisition and about 1 percentage point of headwind from the U.S. HPV sales and about $5 million of first-time sales from the Exiqon acquisition. This is in line with our expectation on a full year basis and also takes into account about 1 percentage point of headwinds from declining U.S. HPV test sales. For adjusted EPS, we have set an underlying target for about $0.38 at constant exchange rates for the fourth quarter and this compares to $0.31 in the fourth quarter of 2015. But the guidance has been set at about $0.15 to $0.16 per share due to the restructuring charges. In terms of the adjusted operating income margin, we continue to anticipate a level about the same as in 2015 on an underlying basis before the restructuring charge and about 18% to 19% including the charge. We believe these initiatives are important to strengthen our foundation for more sustainable growth in 2017 and the coming years, while delivering more operating leverage. Our presentation contains further detailed information on our assumptions for the fourth quarter and the full year. As you saw in the press release, we wanted to provide some initial guidance on sales and adjusted diluted EPS for 2017 and that is for about 6% to 7% constant exchange rate sales growth and for about $1.25 to $1.27 per share. In terms of sales growth, we are anticipating a faster organic growth rate than in 2016. For adjusted EPS, this target represents a significant increase from the underlying guidance for 2016. The outlook for 2017 adjusted EPS includes a benefit from the planned $300 million share buyback during the year and initial contributions from the efficiency gains. It takes into account an 18% adjusted tax rate and also excludes the $0.03 of charge in 2017 from the restructuring. With that, I would like to hand back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Yeah, thank you, Roland. I'm now on slide 14 for a summary before we move into Q&A. So let me review what we just announced. First, we had another solid performance in the third quarter, achieving our targets for net sales and coming in ahead of our target for adjusted EPS while also generating a 15% increase in free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. Second, our results show the benefits of our transformation and we are moving ahead into a new growth trajectory as reflected in our full year sales growth target of 6% to 7% on a CER basis. We are moving ahead on new initiatives to continue the sales acceleration, while also improving our profitability. Third, as part of our increased commitment to return $300 million of capital to shareholders, we are on track to return $250 million in early 2017 through the synthetic share repurchase and the balance during the year through open market repurchases. Also, we have updated our full year 2016 guidance. We are confirming the previous target for 6% to 7% CER sales growth as we maintain a solid higher single-digit CER pace in the fourth quarter. We also continue to expect adjusted EPS of about $1.10 to $1.11 per share before the restructuring charge. Furthermore, we have given you an indication of what to expect in terms of sales growth and profitability for 2017 and we will provide you with much more information and details at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Day. And with that I'd like to hand back to the operator for the Q&A session. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. And our first question today comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI Hey, guys. Congratulations on a really nice quarter here. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Hey. Thanks, Vijay. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI So maybe, Peer, just thinking about the guidance, it's a little unusual for you guys to give FY 2017 color where I think the numbers, they were really encouraging, right. But can you just talk about some of the drivers there? I guess, A) does the 2017 guidance, does it bake in any additional HPV headwinds? And I think in the tools space in general, there's been a lot of noise from Academia, maybe some noise from Pharma. So if you could just give some color on what the guidance, the revenue guidance bakes in for 2017, I think that would be helpful. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Sure. Well, you are absolutely right, Vijay, we normally give guidance in Q1. But this year we obviously have the Analyst Day now coming up in the fourth quarter. And we thought it would be appropriate to be able to discuss 2017 outlooks with you in great detail, but you have that in preparation of that meeting. And we'll obviously be providing a lot more detail during the Analyst Day. In addition, there are also a lot of other things going on, including also some very significant initiatives across the company that we've preparing for quite some time and now moving into execution and that is a contributor to these charges that we are now seeing in the fourth quarter. And we just wanted to also give guidance on what we expect the impacts of those changes to be. In general, the company is on a very good trajectory and moving into the year as we go back into the beginning of the year, we probably would have not been expected really in this momentum, but what we actually were able to see now in the second and also in the third quarter now with the guidance of the fourth quarter continue is a very solid underlying growth trajectory in the range of 6% to 7%. And on top of that, we are actually layering initiatives that should further unfold for the years then thereafter. So everything is pretty well lined up at the moment. The 2017 guidance is an all-in guidance where all of these impacts are now included, both headwinds and tailwinds. And obviously if things go better, things go better. And then we'll communicate it as we go. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks. I want to hit on a couple things. I'll do it all at once here. First on, Peer, can you help us get comfortable with the 4Q margin step-up, ex restructuring? Second, you talked about spinning off certain activities as part of the restructuring. I'm wondering if you are exiting product lines. And then third, can you just talk about the GeneReader roadmap from here, your confidence in the workaround, whether the timelines around fusion and liquid biopsy capabilities have changed and will we get any data at AMP, in particular on the QIAsymphony front end option? Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Sure. If okay, I'll take the two latter questions and then hand over to Roland for the margin question. So, the first was regarding the activity sites that we will be closing. There are two sites. One is a site in Valencia which is a call center and tech service center, and we'll be partly transferring these positions over to the East Coast to our Maryland sites and also are resorting to home office options for certain employees. So that's one of the actions. The other action is, we have an engineering site in Switzerland where we are planning a management buyout by the group and we will continue as a customer for select activities there, but on a more reduced basis. Those are the two larger spin-off activities. We are not anticipating a very material change in the top line due to product line exits or so, but clearly, we are always reviewing that if it makes sense for us to be in certain product lines or businesses. But as of today, that is not on the table. The second is on the GeneReader roadmap. We are really moving in full speed ahead and the feedback is phenomenal ex-U.S., where we are currently actively marketing and we, as I said, we are still targeting the original plan despite the set – this shows you how positive we are actually seeing the uptake ex-U.S. and all of the activities, be they panel or content expansions, be they additions of future editions, they are all fully on track. We might see a small delay in some of the improvement options outside the chemistry, but this is not really too material from a customer value perspective and something we'll talk about more at the Analyst Day. We will certainly be holding a number of sessions at AMP. I don't want to steal the thunder yet. There's a lot of news that we hopefully will be able to share at AMP and it will certainly include a lot of activities around next generation sequencing, informatics, but also new personalized medicine tests and other activities that we're working on that is of interest to the AMP crowd. Roland Sackers - QIAGEN NV Yeah. On the margin side, Tycho, you probably have noticed that we were able to manage down our operation expenses as we indicated before, quite significantly down from the second to the third quarter, roughly $10 million less spending in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and modest comparable to the Q1 levels. So if you would assume for a second that same level, even assuming that there might be a smaller increase, you will see that we should be nicely be able to draw a Q4 guidance if it comes to the expense side and therefore to the profitability. And also in terms of overall margins, I think we have seen in years before also a margin around this 30% adjusted EBITDA. So I would say that it should give us enough comfort level here. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good afternoon. One question on QuantiFERON and then one follow-up on the GeneReader. The question on QuantiFERON is really just a request for a bit of a walkthrough; your visibility in the growth there. It's become a big product and a driver of more than 200 basis points of the total company growth, so it's particularly important that, say in terms of visibility on 2017 just to make sure we know how you are thinking about visibility on tenders and the drivers of what's going on in 2017, hopefully driving another year of 20% growth. And then I'll actually follow up on Tycho's question on GeneReader. Just to put a finer point on it, are you comfortable at this point saying that any material engineering design validation hurdles are cleared so that you can express confidence in a launch timeline on that new chemistry to get you back in the market in the U.S. in 2017? Thanks. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Yeah. Thanks, Steve. So first on QuantiFERON, you are absolutely right. It's a very important franchise for us and expanding very rapidly. We clearly have a vast untapped market opportunity out there. As we are increasing, we are seeing new types of screening strategies emerge, and QuantiFERON is clearly leading that effort and helping in many different settings and countries to help screen for latent TB. We are very active in this space. We have significantly stepped up the commercial efforts. What you see here in the growth rates accelerating is much better commercial execution and also timing coming with a higher awareness, more visibility of the data, and more global also, acceptance of QuantiFERON as the gold standard for latent TB testing. And in addition, we clearly had regulatory events for instance in China a couple years ago that are now starting to show fruit in other countries. So, this is the beginning of a very long trajectory. It's a very fragmented market. It's much less homogenous than other screening markets, meaning every market has different dynamics and different criteria that will be important. So we're very actively pushing that. On GeneReader, I'd really like to stick to the statement if I may – that I made before that we are confident we'll be back in 2017. And we'll provide further information on this hopefully shortly. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Thanks. And congrats on the nice quarter. I was hoping you could elaborate just on the new marketing team roles in optimizing the sales channels. Just what's changing there? It's nice to see the top-line begin to inflect. Just want to make sure there's no real disruption on that front. And then one on personalized medicine; could you just comment a little bit more on the assay growth and what the expectation is for the royalty payments in the next year? Thanks. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Sure. So marketing really changed compared to where it was 10 years ago in the sense that a lot of the activities, a lot of the value chain in marketing is increasingly digitalized and also can be shared across different product and customer classes, much better than you could a few years ago. And what we did was take marketing activities that were running the different areas – we had three business areas as you recall, one life sciences diagnostics and informatics and the foundational activities, be they the marketing analytics, the campaign management, demand generation. And these types of things were now integrated to serve all three of these areas to create enough critical mass and to bring in very high caliber talent that we have across the company that focus them on the execution of certain activities versus having them dedicated to the smaller revenue activities and therefore, typically sub-critical mass. So it has a lot to do with consolidation, and that is where we are taking back office activities or support activities or activities I described before and leveraging them across multiple internal customers for further use. So we actually expect that this should further leverage our digital capabilities and also the ability to use those more effectively to get – to use the additional economy of scale to accelerate further revenue growth. In terms of the Companion Diagnostics portfolio, you saw growth rate was quite nice in the space again, and also the asset growth rate is doing quite well. We saw particular good growth rate in the blood cancer line and that's one that's often overlooked. It's quite a sizeable line. We have a 30%, 40% market share, in some cases more than 50% market share in certain assay, even blood cancer, actually globally. And that's a fantastic franchise that continues to be very important for us. The additional markers that are coming forth from Pharma, you will see some come forward potentially in the near term. We are seeing two, maybe three launches in 2017 in this area. So we had one-and-a-half years now a little bit quieter in terms of approvals, and they have to do with the sequencing and the timing of these programs. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Hi, guys. Roland, on the guidance for next year, what within the 6% or 7% CER are you assuming today for M&A? And would you mind talking to the end market or segment assumptions built into that outlook in terms of MDx, Pharma, Academic, Applied? I mean, if I could, on the bottom line it looks like you'd be close to flat this year on the op margin. So what kind of expansion do you think you can do in 2017, excluding restructuring? Thanks. Roland Sackers - QIAGEN NV Yeah. Thanks for the question. And of course, I don't want to take too much thunder away from the Analyst Day but – so therefore I try to at least to give you some indication. But starting with the bottom line, you clearly could see – and if you just do the calculation that this is again a quite significant ramp up in terms of EPS performance. I would say, it's somewhere around 15%. And so if you calculated into margin performance, it is rather close to a 200 bps improvement over 2016. And I think that is – again there might be certain impacts coming from the gross margin, but most of it – by far the largest share comes out of operational expenses, mainly out of SG&A. and Peer just mentioned a couple of factors where we believe we get actually growth not only a more efficient organization but clearly also impact on the top-line. On the top-line, it's quite clear that the underlying organic growth rate is going to accelerate next year compared to 2016. As the acquisition of MO BIO is annualized in that year, there's only a half year impact from the Exiqon acquisition. So you see a quite significant ramp up on the organic side and that is the main contributor within the 6% to 7%. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Please go ahead. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG (Broker) Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And first question would be actually related to the restructuring program and maybe as a follow up to the last question. And can you quantify how the program will help you to improve the margin not only in 2017 but maybe also in 2018? And then a follow-up question on the GeneReader. And can you potentially help me understand who is actually buying the GeneReader or why you are placing it? Is it solely a PPI model based or actually customer buying the machine? So anything more on that front? Thank you. Roland Sackers - QIAGEN NV Yeah. Let me take the first one here and get it out of our way. On the restructuring cost side, as Peer mentioned we are clearly focusing here on programs which we started over the course of a year and just bringing them all to the finish line. So it is clearly something where we ultimately – they actually do have long-term impact. So the savings which you will see as efficiency gains, you see for 2017 is clearly something what we also expect in 2018 and beyond and probably even to an accelerated, an increasing degree, because it would clearly take some time over the year 2017 for them to finally come into the system. A larger part of the savings and of the refreshing costs as you have seen before is non-cash, so it's roughly $35 million out of the total amount, and the other areas are clearly mostly around MBO and the site closures which also means that you have to get leases on that and things like that out of this way. And again, our focus here on getting a more consolidated view and want our regional hubs here in Germany, within Netherlands and also in Asia is clearly helpful, taking complexity out of the system, not only on the site basis but also in our structures and using the momentum which we gained over the last six to nine months and now we are seeing also momentum on the sales side. And turning that out in overall profitability will allow us that probably this programs has a payback pay at some, let's see, two-and-a-half, three years and therefore being a significant profitability to our – for QIAGEN going forward. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV The other question, Daniel, was the question where the GeneReaders are placed. And we'll have further clarity at the Analyst Day also on this, but the typical customer is a molecular diagnostic lab mostly with pathology activities that has been doing some next generation sequencing very often but wants to get rid of the pain of all the moving parts and the complexity of doing that. And to target that, we obviously started with was solid tumor testing with the actionable panels that we have, and then we moved to liquid biopsy testing after that. And we are seeing everything from the very advanced Molecular pathology labs that just want to do high volumes of these samples in a very robust, reliable and accurate way with very simple to use reporting that the most powerful knowledge base is behind it. This has really resonated very well with such labs. We see that. We see it down to novices who are, in terms of next generation sequencing, novices who have molecular experience and are now starting to next generation sequencing as well. And they just see the enormous simplicity and the cost effectiveness of the solution that we can provide as a one stop shop where all solutions come from us. We also seek large national tenders that we won where there were international programs in how to do tumor sequencing where we are now routinely also being used to run the tests in large numbers and samples in such countries even. And so there is a range of different uses. I think everybody there is very united in the front that people are really looking for a better solution for clinical sequencing. It's not a super powerful machine that they are after. It's not something glitzy and dazzly that changes every few weeks. It's something that is high performance, very reliable, super accurate, and gives results that ultimately can benefit healthcare. And that's exactly what we created, and this resonates extremely well. And so we'll see more of these examples at the Analyst Day. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC Hi. This is Ryan Blicker on for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Two quick ones, starting with Japan, the double-digit growth in Q3 was clearly above recent trend. Can you provide more color on growth by customer class and your thoughts on the outlook for growth moving forward? And then on the balance sheet, could you give us an update on your thoughts surrounding M&A and capital deployment subsequent to the upcoming share repurchase? Are you still capable of doing bolt-on deals in 2017 or should we expect a pause in M&A activity, or should we expect a pause in 2017 with M&A activity maybe resuming in 2018? Thank you. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV So the question on Japan, good catch. So we definitely saw very strong growth in Japan after some weaker years, and it's way ahead of market growth. The Japanese market is primarily a applied testing research market. The diagnostic market, molecular diagnostics is actually a very small market in Japan. It's $100 million maybe in size, maybe a little larger, but we have several big products in the Japanese market, but the growth really came from the academic sales, but also some companion diagnostic sales where we have a very good position in Japan as well. Roland Sackers - QIAGEN NV And one the M&A side, of course we maintain our firepower here. It's again, there's all this opportunities for attractive deals, but of course they have to be financially attractive. And again, M&A as we said before, is part of our strategy. As you know in the past, we were clearly focusing on good deals around bolt-on acquisitions. I think we did very good acquisitions, not only the two last year's but just what we know on the performance from Exiqon on mobile. You see that acquisition's also overall an important contributor to our value generation. So we are clearly going to continue to focus again here the market going forward as well, and we do have flexibility to activate, create value for QIAGEN. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. Great. Thanks, and good evening. A couple of questions. I guess first is, just thinking about the adds to the QuantiFERON team you've made over the year, Peer, can you help us think about kind of how they are trending in terms of ramping up? You know, help us think maybe a little bit about their relative contribution in 2017. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Sure. So as you know, we started ramping up later in 2015 and into the second quarter of 2016. You know, the old rule that a sales rep is typically 20%, 30% productive in year one and 60% in year two and 100% in year three, it takes time to really ramp them up and for them to build the relationships. So we feel very comfortable with the resources we have onboard in the United States. We're looking at expansion in other countries as well. And this will not be like the sudden ramp-up that we saw between mid-2015 and mid-2016. This will more be a continual increase yet whilst probably getting a lot of leverage and economies of scale as we go. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. Got it. And then just a second question. Just thinking I guess about the restructuring plans that you've announced today, help us think about how much you're contemplating kind of beyond what you've mentioned in terms of the couple facilities. Are you looking kind of across different pieces of the organization? Is there some additional leverage you can drive here over the longer term? Thanks, Peer. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Sure. So the two examples of the sites, those are important pieces to several activities that we're doing, so we are clearly working across the organization and also looking at many different things. And the programs that we kicked off, they are forming initiatives, of which sites are one, marketing another one, and they are basically seeking leverage across the organization here. And we are doing this from a position of strength, which is maybe unusual, but it just shows our commitment to drive value going forward. We feel very comfortable about the top-line trajectory and that being able to continue, but we completely recognize that we also had to ask for patience while we were pushing the top line. And before we were able to enter into the phase now of focusing on the bottom line as well, we needed to accelerate that through initiatives around the portfolio, but also the commercial channels. That being behind us, we're moving into that next phase, and this is why this is the logical consequence. All this is built in our plan and we already were planning this early in this year. And so, this for us was something that we turned to when we saw that the top-line was accelerating and was sustainable. Operator And our last question for today comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Yeah, thanks very much for taking my questions. Excuse me. So, just one question on QuantiFERON. Certainly seems that the business is performing very well, and you highlight here about some recent recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and obviously more and more global activity and awareness surrounding this. So I just wondered if you could share thoughts. Is it beyond the realms of possibility that you accelerate growth further in this business given this increased global awareness and recommendation, or is that more difficult, given the relative size of the business now? If you could share thoughts there. And also, obviously you are in litigation with Oxford surrounding this product. We've seen how you've been potentially injuncted from one product in North America, albeit, hopefully temporarily. Is this is a risk that you see for this franchise that we should be aware of? Or perhaps you could share some thoughts about what the likely scenario is here. Thank you. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Hey, Scott, thanks. Well, clearly QuantiFERON is a very important growth driver for us. And as I said before, we see a long trajectory in front of us with the vast market opportunities they need to be converting. We are constantly adding new market opportunities. Basically, as we speak, the ability to detect transition, or risk of transmission – transition from latent to active, these are completely new opportunities that provide us a new clinical value to the test and open up new segments in a much more meaningful way, and potentially accelerate also conversion from the skin tests even more. So, it's just execution from here going forward. And the team is executing extremely well. We have great new innovation in this area that we launched, just the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus product, that was kind of quietly introduced a couple years ago and actually forcefully introduced it in the markets is phenomenal. It's a complete game changer in terms of workflow, but also with new technological features that we think are just going to be extremely valuable and important going forward. Now, for some reason the litigation has emerged in this area, which is still – we are scratching our heads a little bit why this is being done. And we have hundreds, even thousands of IP positions that we're working on and litigation that we are in. And QIAGEN is not typically the company that is – it's typically the company that has always found ways to settle, but this is – we just don't understand this situation and we'll absolutely defend our freedom here. The ability to create an injunction is not in the pathway of this litigation. But I'd leave it at that. The real focus that we have is not really on that. That I think is noise by a competitor who are in the meantime now outgrowing, even though we have eight times more volume than they do and are just doing phenomenally better. And unfortunately, we are seeing people resort to all kinds of stuff. So, this is just the way of life, unfortunately. John Gilardi - QIAGEN NV With that, I'd like to hand back, end this conference call and thank you for your participation. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.

And our first question today comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI Hey, guys. Congratulations on a really nice quarter here. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Hey. Thanks, Vijay. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI So maybe, Peer, just thinking about the guidance, it's a little unusual for you guys to give FY 2017 color where I think the numbers, they were really encouraging, right. But can you just talk about some of the drivers there? I guess, A) does the 2017 guidance, does it bake in any additional HPV headwinds? And I think in the tools space in general, there's been a lot of noise from Academia, maybe some noise from Pharma. So if you could just give some color on what the guidance, the revenue guidance bakes in for 2017, I think that would be helpful. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Sure. Well, you are absolutely right, Vijay, we normally give guidance in Q1. But this year we obviously have the Analyst Day now coming up in the fourth quarter. And we thought it would be appropriate to be able to discuss 2017 outlooks with you in great detail, but you have that in preparation of that meeting. And we'll obviously be providing a lot more detail during the Analyst Day. In addition, there are also a lot of other things going on, including also some very significant initiatives across the company that we've preparing for quite some time and now moving into execution and that is a contributor to these charges that we are now seeing in the fourth quarter. And we just wanted to also give guidance on what we expect the impacts of those changes to be. In general, the company is on a very good trajectory and moving into the year as we go back into the beginning of the year, we probably would have not been expected really in this momentum, but what we actually were able to see now in the second and also in the third quarter now with the guidance of the fourth quarter continue is a very solid underlying growth trajectory in the range of 6% to 7%. And on top of that, we are actually layering initiatives that should further unfold for the years then thereafter. So everything is pretty well lined up at the moment. The 2017 guidance is an all-in guidance where all of these impacts are now included, both headwinds and tailwinds. And obviously if things go better, things go better. And then we'll communicate it as we go. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks. I want to hit on a couple things. I'll do it all at once here. First on, Peer, can you help us get comfortable with the 4Q margin step-up, ex restructuring? Second, you talked about spinning off certain activities as part of the restructuring. I'm wondering if you are exiting product lines. And then third, can you just talk about the GeneReader roadmap from here, your confidence in the workaround, whether the timelines around fusion and liquid biopsy capabilities have changed and will we get any data at AMP, in particular on the QIAsymphony front end option? Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Sure. If okay, I'll take the two latter questions and then hand over to Roland for the margin question. So, the first was regarding the activity sites that we will be closing. There are two sites. One is a site in Valencia which is a call center and tech service center, and we'll be partly transferring these positions over to the East Coast to our Maryland sites and also are resorting to home office options for certain employees. So that's one of the actions. The other action is, we have an engineering site in Switzerland where we are planning a management buyout by the group and we will continue as a customer for select activities there, but on a more reduced basis. Those are the two larger spin-off activities. We are not anticipating a very material change in the top line due to product line exits or so, but clearly, we are always reviewing that if it makes sense for us to be in certain product lines or businesses. But as of today, that is not on the table. The second is on the GeneReader roadmap. We are really moving in full speed ahead and the feedback is phenomenal ex-U.S., where we are currently actively marketing and we, as I said, we are still targeting the original plan despite the set – this shows you how positive we are actually seeing the uptake ex-U.S. and all of the activities, be they panel or content expansions, be they additions of future editions, they are all fully on track. We might see a small delay in some of the improvement options outside the chemistry, but this is not really too material from a customer value perspective and something we'll talk about more at the Analyst Day. We will certainly be holding a number of sessions at AMP. I don't want to steal the thunder yet. There's a lot of news that we hopefully will be able to share at AMP and it will certainly include a lot of activities around next generation sequencing, informatics, but also new personalized medicine tests and other activities that we're working on that is of interest to the AMP crowd. Roland Sackers - QIAGEN NV Yeah. On the margin side, Tycho, you probably have noticed that we were able to manage down our operation expenses as we indicated before, quite significantly down from the second to the third quarter, roughly $10 million less spending in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and modest comparable to the Q1 levels. So if you would assume for a second that same level, even assuming that there might be a smaller increase, you will see that we should be nicely be able to draw a Q4 guidance if it comes to the expense side and therefore to the profitability. And also in terms of overall margins, I think we have seen in years before also a margin around this 30% adjusted EBITDA. So I would say that it should give us enough comfort level here. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good afternoon. One question on QuantiFERON and then one follow-up on the GeneReader. The question on QuantiFERON is really just a request for a bit of a walkthrough; your visibility in the growth there. It's become a big product and a driver of more than 200 basis points of the total company growth, so it's particularly important that, say in terms of visibility on 2017 just to make sure we know how you are thinking about visibility on tenders and the drivers of what's going on in 2017, hopefully driving another year of 20% growth. And then I'll actually follow up on Tycho's question on GeneReader. Just to put a finer point on it, are you comfortable at this point saying that any material engineering design validation hurdles are cleared so that you can express confidence in a launch timeline on that new chemistry to get you back in the market in the U.S. in 2017? Thanks. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Yeah. Thanks, Steve. So first on QuantiFERON, you are absolutely right. It's a very important franchise for us and expanding very rapidly. We clearly have a vast untapped market opportunity out there. As we are increasing, we are seeing new types of screening strategies emerge, and QuantiFERON is clearly leading that effort and helping in many different settings and countries to help screen for latent TB. We are very active in this space. We have significantly stepped up the commercial efforts. What you see here in the growth rates accelerating is much better commercial execution and also timing coming with a higher awareness, more visibility of the data, and more global also, acceptance of QuantiFERON as the gold standard for latent TB testing. And in addition, we clearly had regulatory events for instance in China a couple years ago that are now starting to show fruit in other countries. So, this is the beginning of a very long trajectory. It's a very fragmented market. It's much less homogenous than other screening markets, meaning every market has different dynamics and different criteria that will be important. So we're very actively pushing that. On GeneReader, I'd really like to stick to the statement if I may – that I made before that we are confident we'll be back in 2017. And we'll provide further information on this hopefully shortly. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Thanks. And congrats on the nice quarter. I was hoping you could elaborate just on the new marketing team roles in optimizing the sales channels. Just what's changing there? It's nice to see the top-line begin to inflect. Just want to make sure there's no real disruption on that front. And then one on personalized medicine; could you just comment a little bit more on the assay growth and what the expectation is for the royalty payments in the next year? Thanks. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Sure. So marketing really changed compared to where it was 10 years ago in the sense that a lot of the activities, a lot of the value chain in marketing is increasingly digitalized and also can be shared across different product and customer classes, much better than you could a few years ago. And what we did was take marketing activities that were running the different areas – we had three business areas as you recall, one life sciences diagnostics and informatics and the foundational activities, be they the marketing analytics, the campaign management, demand generation. And these types of things were now integrated to serve all three of these areas to create enough critical mass and to bring in very high caliber talent that we have across the company that focus them on the execution of certain activities versus having them dedicated to the smaller revenue activities and therefore, typically sub-critical mass.

So we actually expect that this should further leverage our digital capabilities and also the ability to use those more effectively to get – to use the additional economy of scale to accelerate further revenue growth. In terms of the Companion Diagnostics portfolio, you saw growth rate was quite nice in the space again, and also the asset growth rate is doing quite well. We saw particular good growth rate in the blood cancer line and that's one that's often overlooked. It's quite a sizeable line. We have a 30%, 40% market share, in some cases more than 50% market share in certain assay, even blood cancer, actually globally. And that's a fantastic franchise that continues to be very important for us. The additional markers that are coming forth from Pharma, you will see some come forward potentially in the near term.

Schatz - QIAGEN NV So the question on Japan, good catch. So we definitely saw very strong growth in Japan after some weaker years, and it's way ahead of market growth. The Japanese market is primarily a applied testing research market. The diagnostic market, molecular diagnostics is actually a very small market in Japan. It's $100 million maybe in size, maybe a little larger, but we have several big products in the Japanese market, but the growth really came from the academic sales, but also some companion diagnostic sales where we have a very good position in Japan as well. Roland Sackers - QIAGEN NV And one the M&A side, of course we maintain our firepower here. It's again, there's all this opportunities for attractive deals, but of course they have to be financially attractive. And again, M&A as we said before, is part of our strategy. As you know in the past, we were clearly focusing on good deals around bolt-on acquisitions. I think we did very good acquisitions, not only the two last year's but just what we know on the performance from Exiqon on mobile. You see that acquisition's also overall an important contributor to our value generation. So we are clearly going to continue to focus again here the market going forward as well, and we do have flexibility to activate, create value for QIAGEN. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. Great. Thanks, and good evening. A couple of questions. I guess first is, just thinking about the adds to the QuantiFERON team you've made over the year, Peer, can you help us think about kind of how they are trending in terms of ramping up? You know, help us think maybe a little bit about their relative contribution in 2017. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Sure. So as you know, we started ramping up later in 2015 and into the second quarter of 2016. You know, the old rule that a sales rep is typically 20%, 30% productive in year one and 60% in year two and 100% in year three, it takes time to really ramp them up and for them to build the relationships. So we feel very comfortable with the resources we have onboard in the United States. We're looking at expansion in other countries as well. And this will not be like the sudden ramp-up that we saw between mid-2015 and mid-2016. This will more be a continual increase yet whilst probably getting a lot of leverage and economies of scale as we go. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. Got it. And then just a second question. Just thinking I guess about the restructuring plans that you've announced today, help us think about how much you're contemplating kind of beyond what you've mentioned in terms of the couple facilities. Are you looking kind of across different pieces of the organization? Is there some additional leverage you can drive here over the longer term? Thanks, Peer. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Sure. So the two examples of the sites, those are important pieces to several activities that we're doing, so we are clearly working across the organization and also looking at many different things. And the programs that we kicked off, they are forming initiatives, of which sites are one, marketing another one, and they are basically seeking leverage across the organization here. And we are doing this from a position of strength, which is maybe unusual, but it just shows our commitment to drive value going forward. We feel very comfortable about the top-line trajectory and that being able to continue, but we completely recognize that we also had to ask for patience while we were pushing the top line. And before we were able to enter into the phase now of focusing on the bottom line as well, we needed to accelerate that through initiatives around the portfolio, but also the commercial channels. That being behind us, we're moving into that next phase, and this is why this is the logical consequence. All this is built in our plan and we already were planning this early in this year. And so, this for us was something that we turned to when we saw that the top-line was accelerating and was sustainable. Operator And our last question for today comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Yeah, thanks very much for taking my questions. Excuse me. So, just one question on QuantiFERON. Certainly seems that the business is performing very well, and you highlight here about some recent recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and obviously more and more global activity and awareness surrounding this. So I just wondered if you could share thoughts. Is it beyond the realms of possibility that you accelerate growth further in this business given this increased global awareness and recommendation, or is that more difficult, given the relative size of the business now? If you could share thoughts there. And also, obviously you are in litigation with Oxford surrounding this product. We've seen how you've been potentially injuncted from one product in North America, albeit, hopefully temporarily. Is this is a risk that you see for this franchise that we should be aware of? Or perhaps you could share some thoughts about what the likely scenario is here. Thank you. Peer M. Schatz - QIAGEN NV Hey, Scott, thanks. Well, clearly QuantiFERON is a very important growth driver for us. And as I said before, we see a long trajectory in front of us with the vast market opportunities they need to be converting. We are constantly adding new market opportunities. Basically, as we speak, the ability to detect transition, or risk of transmission – transition from latent to active, these are completely new opportunities that provide us a new clinical value to the test and open up new segments in a much more meaningful way, and potentially accelerate also conversion from the skin tests even more. So, it's just execution from here going forward. And the team is executing extremely well. We have great new innovation in this area that we launched, just the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus product, that was kind of quietly introduced a couple years ago and actually forcefully introduced it in the markets is phenomenal. It's a complete game changer in terms of workflow, but also with new technological features that we think are just going to be extremely valuable and important going forward. Now, for some reason the litigation has emerged in this area, which is still – we are scratching our heads a little bit why this is being done. And we have hundreds, even thousands of IP positions that we're working on and litigation that we are in. And QIAGEN is not typically the company that is – it's typically the company that has always found ways to settle, but this is – we just don't understand this situation and we'll absolutely defend our freedom here. The ability to create an injunction is not in the pathway of this litigation. But I'd leave it at that. The real focus that we have is not really on that. That I think is noise by a competitor who are in the meantime now outgrowing, even though we have eight times more volume than they do and are just doing phenomenally better. And unfortunately, we are seeing people resort to all kinds of stuff. So, this is just the way of life, unfortunately. John Gilardi - QIAGEN NV With that, I'd like to hand back, end this conference call and thank you for your participation. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.

And I would like to welcome you all to this conference call. As you saw in the press release and in our presentation, our results for the fourth quarter and the full year show an accelerating performance during 2016. Our transformation is building momentum and we move ahead on a new growth trajectory and we are seeing the benefits of strengthening our position as a global leader for molecular Sample to Insight solutions. We are determined to build on this success and make significant progress in 2017.  Let me go through our key messages. First, we achieved our targets for the fourth quarter and for 2016. On a full-year basis, net sales rose 6% at constant exchange rates, which was in line with our guidance for 6% to 7% CER growth, and we’re up 4% at actual rates, due to the 2 percentage points of currency headwinds. Sales grew at a faster 8% CER rate when you exclude the declining sales of HPV test in the U.S.  In terms of adjusted diluted earnings per share at constant exchange rates they were $0.90 for the year or $1.14 per share, excluding the restructuring charge of $0.24 are recorded in the fourth quarter to deliver efficiencies, while sustaining our sales momentum. This was above our target for $1.10 to $1.11 per share at constant exchange rates.  For the fourth quarter, net sales were up 8% CER, but we face 3 percentage points of currency headwinds giving the significant year in shifts and rates. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding the restructuring charge were $0.41 at the constant exchange rates and the adjusted operating income margin, excluded the charge was 31%, which is among the best in the industry.  Second, QIAGEN's transformation is building momentum across our Sample to Insight portfolio. The results for the fourth quarter and also the accelerating performance during the year were important steps towards achieving the new goals we had set for QIAGEN to excel towards 2020 and that we announced at our Investor Day in November. These are for compound annual growth in net sales of about 7% to 9% CER from 2016 to 2020, and adjusted EPS growth of at least 12% CER during that same period. This positions QIAGEN as among the fastest growing companies in our sector.  During this transformation, we have placed priorities on several areas of high growth and differentiation within our portfolio to address urging customer needs. This includes the QuantiFERON latent TB test, a key growth driver. Our teams delivered worldwide growth above the 25% CER target for QuantiFERON and the fourth generation of this test was submitted for U.S. approval.  We’re also pleased to have reached our targets for 55 to 60 new placements of the GeneReader NGS System in the market segment system segment for benchtop NGS Systems, primarily for oncology applications. In fact, we exceeded our goal for at least 10% of new placements in this segment. This is a great result for a system that is primarily used in clinical and clinical research setting, which normally need long validation periods. We look forward to rolling out the comprehensive enhancements in new gene panels announced for 2017.  Related to our initiatives in next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics in January, we announced the acquisition of OmicSoft, a privately held company in the U.S. that complements our industry-leading bioinformatics portfolio. OmicSoft markets, a suite of tools that allow customers to analyze and manage very large NGS data sets in a research setting that increasingly benefits from the power of data sharing.  Third, we are committed to increasing returns and creating significant value. Our conviction about the power of this transformation was shown through our decision in 2016 to set a goal to return $300 million to shareholders by the end of 2017. The first tranche was completed in January with a return of about $245 million through the synthetic share repurchase and we intend to return the balance of the $300 million, through open market repurchases during the year. Finally, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2017 that we shared with you in November. On a full-year basis, we continue to expect about 6% to 7% CER sales growth and this incorporates the modest incremental contributions from the OmicSoft acquisition. Our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share also remains at $1.25 to $1.27 per share at constant exchange rates, excluding the anticipated $0.03 of restructuring cost for 2017.  As a last point, I would like to mention the leadership change mentioned in the quarterly report with the appointment of Thomas Schweins to be head of the Life Science Business Area. Thomas has been with QIAGEN since 2004 and has been an integral part of our Executive Committee during this period. Thomas has extensive industry experience based on this prior role as Head of Marketing and Strategy at QIAGEN where he was involved in managing our Global Life Science business for many years, and also through his previous experience at BCG, as well as Hoechst and Aventis.  Thomas is taking over from Brad Crutchfield, who unfortunately had to step down from his role for personal and family reasons and he is returning to California from his assignment at QIAGEN based in Germany. So on behalf of my colleagues and all of our employees around the world, I would like to wish Brad all the best for his future.  On Slide 5, I would like to now update you on some of the key developments in the fourth quarter. The QuantiFERON latent TB test reached an important milestone when the fourth-generation of the test was submitted for pre-market approval by the U.S. FDA in early January. The recent guidelines from the World Health Organization and the U.S. preventive services task force provide an important tailwind for us, and very recently QuantiFERON was selected in a major government tender in South Korea's part of a national strategy to eliminate TB.  We’re rolling out a comprehensive package of enhancements for the GeneReader NGS System further streamlining workflow efficiency enabling improved data output and shorter turnaround times, as well as significantly broadening our content offering featuring a range of oncology panels and most importantly a channel for customized panel design. I would like to now walk you through each of the key highlight areas in more detail.  I’m now on Slide 6 to give you an overview of the QuantiFERON latent TB test. QuantiFERON continues to be a very exciting opportunity for us and we saw growth accelerating to a new 25% CER pace for full-year 2016, and growing above this pace in the fourth quarter. The submission of the fourth generation test to the FDA is an important step in further driving the adoption of the test in its increased clinical benefits. This follows the successful 2016 launch of QuantiFERON-TB plus in more than 60 countries around Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Latin America.  The fact that we submitted the fourth-generation test in the United States is also a good indication that we were able to address the issues raised in an FDA warning letter, we discussed with you last year, and we believe this issue is now fully resolved. During 2017, we will continue to create more awareness around latent TB testing and to participate in new national initiatives to eliminate tuberculosis such as in South Korea.  In the latest milestone, QuantiFERON-TB has won a tender by the Republic of Korea Armed Forces for screening of about 340,000 recruits during this year. This is just one example of many such initiatives we are pursuing and working on around the world. We will also continue to strengthen our QuantiFERON sales team to further accelerate geographic expansion and to drive an even faster conversion of the market from skin test of QuantiFERON-TB.  I’m now on Slide 7 to update you on recent developments with the GeneReader NGS System, our complete Sample to Insight next-generation sequencing workflow. The GeneReader System is really the first purpose-built NGS platform for clinical panel testing and the reception in 2016 was extremely positive. We targeted to achieve about 10% of the clinical oncology benchtop sequencing market in the first year, and we were very proud to announce that we exceeded that target. We have now set a substantially increased target for 2017. GeneReader is the first fully integrated complete NGS clinical workflow with predictable cost, actionable insights, expertise and services. It also provides great flexibility and this allows even the lowest throughput customers to start NGS sequencing with great economics and also allows higher throughput labs to address their gene panel needs.  Our goal for 2017 is to further accelerate the positive commercialization momentum we reached in 2016 and to fully leverage the benefits of the new system enhancements and the vastly broaden menu capabilities. On Slide 8, you can now see a more detailed overview of the GeneReader enhancements we announced earlier this month. We are pleased to announce that the upgraded capabilities of GeneReader, which are spread across the new and vast content menu exceeds the competing solutions in terms of critical parameters that matter the most in this segment.  We introduced new panel variant types to now also include detection of copy number variations, large rearrangements, exon-skipping events, and gene fusions. With the introduction of our proprietary digital NGS technology, we have boosted accuracy of the GeneReader NGS System to Q60, meaning of 1000 fold lower bass call error rate than the current industry standard.  In addition, we can now detect even the most complex mutations and do so with both formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and liquid biopsy samples using the same gene panels. This eliminates the need for a specialist panel and significantly reduces the validation effort for every lab. More importantly, a customized channel will be offered for predesigned NGS sequencing assays, and this will open up unlimited panel content to meet the needs of our customers.  To support the integration of the self-designed panels within our Sample to Insight solutions, we will also make customization of our bioinformatics solutions available. The comprehensive upgrade package also includes new sequencing chemistry that will become available during the first quarter this year, higher data output per flow cell, 20% higher sample throughput capacity, and higher batch efficiency. This is an important next step and a successful rollout of the system one year after launch, keeping up-to-date with the evolution of the technology and we're confident the market is beginning to really understand the value proposition of the GeneReader NGS System as the first complete and economical Sample to Insight NGS System.  On slide 9, I would now like to give you an overview of our personalized healthcare franchise, in 2016 we successfully surpassed the milestone of 20 master collaboration agreements for companion diagnostics with pharmaceutical companies and on the left you can see our selection of our Pharma partners who are running multiple programs with us.  In personalized, we are leveraging our know-how experience and development expertise to bring forward new solutions for patient stratification to capture at least 50% of the available molecular companion diagnostic deals. Our ambition going into 2017 is not just to further increase the share, but also to expand our portfolio of tests beyond our current PCR and NGS focus.  We intend to broaden indications as well. As platforms in our companion diagnostic deals, and expand our track record in oncology and infectious disease and immune monitoring. One example of how we're doing this, is the recently announced partnership signed with Singulex, a U.S.-based next-generation immunodiagnostic company and this collaboration will leveraging new multimodal diagnostic solutions, and highly sensitive platform technologies for select Pharma partners to support clinical trial investigations for a number of disease areas that they are interrogating with immunoassay diagnostics such as cardiovascular diseases, immunology, and inflammation.  I’m now on Slide 10 to update you on the QIAsymphony automation system. We exceeded our 2016 goal of 1,750 cumulative placements and have again achieved solid double-digit consumable growth. Our strategy takes a geographic focus. In the United States, we are primarily targeting areas such as transportation testing, the needs of customers to automate laboratory developed tests, and higher volume sample processing with a wide installed base of many molecular detection message such as PCR and next-generation sequencing used downstream.  In Europe, we are leveraging our broad PCR test menu in addition to the opportunities for sample processing described before, and are adding new test that will create greater value for customers. Our goal is to maintain a solid annual placement rate and reach more than 2,000 cumulative placements by the end of 2017.  I’m now on Slide 11 to review highlights of our Sample to Insight portfolio of Life Science products and workflows that support innovations at cutting edge of research. Differentiated technologies refers to areas that we have identified in academia and other environments as core innovation areas that are building up critical mass and scientific research and have the potential to move into clinical use. One example we talked about often is liquid biopsies.  Today, our market share and processing liquid biopsy samples is well above 80%. At the core of this technology, is really a sample processing channel. We have an extremely strong position in this area for blood based on our workflows for unbiased DNA stabilization and purification with the PAXgene blood system and this has been launched for full automation on the QIAsymphony platform. We are now introducing new and highly specific QIAmp solutions for circulating free DNA that have an incredible DNA capturing efficiencies.  While our previous solutions are a strong liquid biopsy gold standard well ahead of the competitions, these new solutions exhibit for example a capturing efficiency at least three times higher than the performance of competing products in direct head-to-head comparisons. Microbiome is another area in which we have built-up capacities in 2016. In particular with the successful integration of MO BIO into our Sample to Insight portfolio. We have our market share here in sample processing well above 80%, and during 2016 we introduced dedicated assays and bioinformatics solutions to create seamless Sample to Insight workflows.  A further initiative is in single cell research, where we launched QIAscout in 2016 as a single cell selector that integrates very nicely with our sample processing product, as well as assays and bioinformatics solutions. This compact and very cost efficient devise enables a significant number of labs to get involved in this area. And that will further drive democratization of single cell technology. We are developing various technologies to add to this portfolio and we will keep you updated.  On Slide 12, I would like to introduce the latest addition to our bioinformatics franchise, OmicSoft, or small U.S.-based Company which we acquired in January 2017 and which further expands and complements our industry-leading portfolio of bioinformatics solutions. Bioinformatics represent a crucial asset and an integral part of our Sample to Insight portfolios and Life Sciences in molecular diagnostics, and is increasingly becoming a true competitive advantage.  The acquisition of OmicSoft further differentiates our capabilities for data management by adding a scalable and flexible software infrastructure that enables customer to effectively manage and share vast amounts of Omics and NGS primary datasets, analyze and visualize these data sets, and compare them to large and highly curetted publicly available multi-omics datasets.  Data management of these large datasets is very important for all genomes customers and in particular in the clinical community. Data sharing is emerging as an incredibly important need in this new age of genomic testing.  With that, I would like to hand over to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. Good afternoon to those of you in Europe and good morning to those of you in the U.S. I would like to review our financial performance for the first quarter and full year and also update you on our guidance for 2017. We achieved our goals for 2016 in terms of sales, adjusted earnings, and we are particularly pleased with the 22% increase in free cash flow to $267 million.  We have been taking targeted actions to support future sales growth and deliver operating margin improvements after a period of investments, and these results are an important step in setting the new growth trajectory towards 2020. Above all, the support our top priority to increase shareholder returns and create value.  For the fourth quarter, net sales holds 8% at constant exchange rates and were up 5% at extra rates to $366.5 million, due to an unexpectedly strong 3 percentage points of advanced currency movements. This happened later in the quarter with the search in the dollar against the euro and also against the yen to Turkish lira and other currencies.  As expected, about 3 percentage points of growth came from the acquisitions of MO BIO and Exiqon, while organic growth provided 5 percentage points. We also saw the headwinds fade in this quarter for U.S. HPV test sales, which were down largely in line with our 2016 target to about $33 million, compared to $46 million in 2015. To address the issue now, we expect about one percentage point of headwind in 2017.  About in any case these sales are expected to represent well below 2% of the total for QIAGEN in 2017. Among the product categories, we saw solid growth during the fourth quarter and full year for consumables and related revenues. Heavy [indiscernible] sales rise 8% constant exchange rate in the fourth quarter, which was above the full-year rate of 6% full-year growth and providing about 87% of full-year total sales.  Instrument sales also rose at a solid rate growing 6% CER in the fourth quarter and another for 5% CER growth rate for the full year, and providing about 30% of full-year sales. The stronger growth rate in the second half of the year, which led to full-year sales rise in 6% CER in-line with our guidance, reflects the impact of our transformation and the benefits of investments we made to step up commercialization of our growth drivers, and expand into new geographic markets.  So organic growth rates for 2016 was actually right at 4.5 CER had to absorb the U.S. HPV sales headwind. So this provides a good foundation to move into 2017. Moving down the income statement for the fourth quarter, the adjusted gross margin excluding the pre-tax restructurings was rose by a 50 basis points to 71.1% of sales, thanks to better product mix towards consumables.  Adjusted operating income was $44.5 million, but was $112.7 million, excluding the charge. This means, the underlying adjusted operating income margin for the fourth quarter was 31% of sales and in-line with the target we had said and this was due to overall significantly lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales.  As a reminder, the pre-tax restructuring charge was $79.1 million of which about $68 million [Audio Gap] For the full-year adjusted operating income, excluding this charge was 2% to $324.8 million, and the adjusted operating income margin, including the charge declined by about 50 basis points to 24.3% of sales from 24.8% in 2015. The main reason was the decline in the adjusted gross margin, which fell to 70.6% of sales from 71.2% in 2015.  Sales and marketing, as well as SG&A expenses were largely affected as a percentage of sales, while R&D investments declined modestly. Moving further down the income statement for the fourth quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding the charges was $0.39 at actual rates and $0.41 at constant exchange rates. The adjusted tax rate, excluding the charge was 15% of sales, which was slightly below our target of 17%.  On a full-year basis, in fact we came in ahead of our guidance with $1.14 per share as CER, excluding the charge and that was $1.11 at actual rates. Here again we had an adjusted tax rate of 16% of sales and in-line with our guidance for about 16% to 17%. I would like to now provide you with an overview of the performance among the customer classes. As noted earlier the acquisition of MO BIO on Exiqon supports the performance in all customer classes and the majority of the sales were in Academia, Pharma and Applied Testing.  Molecular diagnostics sales of products through these customers were up 11% CER in the fourth quarter and rising at a 12% CER rate when excluding the modest headwind from U.S. HPV sales in this period. These results shows the power of our portfolio and led to full-year sales rising 7% CEI molecular diagnostics and advancing 10% CER, excluding US HPV test sales.  Moving to the life science customer class, we saw robust 10% CER growth among applied testing customers in the fourth quarter, maintaining the double-digit CER growth trend from the second and third quarter of 2016. Sales for the year were up 7% CER and as we have noted, these results can be volatile on a quarterly basis, due to customer ordering patterns. After an outstanding performance in the third quarter of 2016, sales to Pharma customers maintained a solid mid-single digit pace in the first fourth quarter rising 5% CER and achieving a full-year rate of 7% CER growth. Here we are seeing solid consumables growth, but weaker trends in instrument sales and after modestly optimistic outlook going into 2017, given the expectations for increases in Pharma R&D spending. In Academia, sales were up 3% CER in the fourth quarter, thanks to higher consumables sales, but weaker instrument sales and in particular the soft trends in Europe. At the same time, sales for 2016 was 4% CER and we see positive company specific factors supporting our growth prospect for 2017.  I would like to now review our performance across the regions with all regions delivering growth for the fourth quarter and for the year. We were particularly pleased with the ongoing expansion in the top seven emerging markets, which grew 70% CER for the fourth quarter and provided 18% of sales and were up 90% CER for the year. China kept up the double-digit CER growth pace during the year, along with important contributions from South Korea, Turkey, India, and Brazil.  Emerging markets helped drives Asia Pacific, Japan region to the fastest growth rate with sales up 14% CER in the fourth quarter, and 11% CER for the year. China, South Korea, and India were among the key contributors and we saw good expansion in Thailand following our entry. The Americas region showed 5% CER growth for both the fourth quarter and for the year, moving beyond the U.S. HPV test headwinds, thanks to a higher sales of QuantiFERON-TB test, and improved conditions among life science customers.  Brazil also maintained a solid CER growth pace in the first quarter, while Mexico had growth for the year despite a drop in the fourth quarter due to the timing of national tenders. As a last point, the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region delivered 10% CER growth in the fourth quarter, returning to a stronger pace after software trends in the third quarter and resulting in sales for the full year rising 8% CER, and providing about one-third of our total sales. In this region we benefited from expansion in the markets such as France, the United Kingdom, Turkey, and the Middle East where we opened a new hub in Dubai. This helps to more than offset the software trends in Germany that we have seen during the second half of the year.  I would like to now give you an update on our balance sheet and cash flows, and also on the progress to return $300 million of capital to shareholders by the end of 2017. We had a goal for about $350 million of operating cash flow for 2016 and we came close with $342 million. This compares to $380 million in 2015 and an achievement especially given the currency headwinds against the dollar.  In fact, we had $100 million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2016 and this marks the first we have reached this quarterly ladder. Our balance sheet benefits from the improving cash flow and our leverage ratio stood at 1.2 times net debt to adjusted EBTIDA at the end of 2016, and this compares to 1.6 times at the end of 2015. We continue to pursue a disciplined capital allocation strategy to support internal business expansion, while also making targeted acquisitions as you saw with OmicSoft and also increasing returns to shareholders.  We just completed the strategic share repurchases on January 24 with a return of about $245 million. This reduced a total numbers of issued QIAGEN shares by approximately 3.7% to $230.8 million as of January 31, 2017 compared to $239.7 million at the end of 2016. We intend to return the balance of the $300 million commitment through traditional market purchases during the year.  Taking into account, the OmicSoft acquisition and the capital return plans the pro forma leverage would have been about 1.9 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of 2016. However, given our strong cash flow generation, we see this coming down quickly and we have an healthy balance sheet to take advantage of targeted strategic opportunities.  I would like to now review our guidance for 2017 and this remains unchanged from the initial perspectives we gave you in November 2016 at our investor event. We continue to expect about 6% to 7% CER sales growth for the full year and for underlying earnings of about $1.25 to $1.27 per share at constant exchange rates.  In terms of sales growth, we will return to using adjusted net sales due to the OmicSoft acquisition, which is common for IT related views to show the full sales and profitability impact and also what we did in the past with these types of deals. We are currently expecting about 5 to 6 percentage points of organic growth at about 1 percentage point contribution from acquisition of Exiqon, which was acquired in June 2016; and from OmicSoft, which was acquired in January.  For adjusted EPS, this target represents a significant increase from underlying $1.11 per share for 2016. This outlook includes about $0.03 of benefit from the planned $300 million return commitment and initial contributions from the efficiency initiative. It also takes into account an anticipated 18% adjusted tax rate, and excludes the expected $0.03 of dilution from restructuring charges in 2017.  I would like to also provide some estimates about anticipated adverse currency impacts given the swing scene at the end of 2016. Based on rates as of January 31, we expect pressure of about of about 2 percentage points on the full-year CER sales growth target and about $0.02 per share on the full-year adjusted EPS guidance at CER rates. You can find further information on anticipated currency impacts for 2017 based on rates as of January 31, 2017 in the appendix of this presentation.  On Slide 18, you will see information on the details and assumptions for our outlook for the full year and also for the first quarter of 2017. In terms of net sales for the first quarter, we have set a target for about $0.04 to $0.05 CER sales growth in adjusted net earnings. As we noted earlier, we anticipate about 1 percentage points of headwinds from the U.S. HPV sales for the full year, and this includes about 2 percentage points in the first quarter. We have set a target for adjusted diluted EPS of about $0.21 to $0.22 per share for the first quarter of 2017, at constant exchange rates and this also excludes the restructuring charge.  We anticipate about $0.02 to $0.03 per share of restructuring charges to be taken in the first quarter of 2017, and this is part of the full-year guidance for about $0.03 of charge. For the currency impact, based on currency rates as of January 31, 2017, we anticipate for the first quarter about 2 percentage points of headwind on sales at actual rates up to $0.01 on adjusted diluted EPS.  With that, I would like to hand back to Peer. Peer Schatz Yes, thank you Roland. I’m now on Slide 19 for a summary, before I move into Q&A. Let me review what we have announced. First in 2016, we achieved an inflection point for faster sales growth, and took steps to increase operating leverage for 2017 and years to come. Second, our Sample to Insight transformation makes QIAGEN a stronger, more differentiated leader with a momentum across a broad range of molecular testing. We have committed to higher returns and are delivering value creation to shareholders.  As I think you can see from our location of capital and actions to drive improvements in efficiency. Finally, we have affirmed the 2017 guidance we provided in November 2016 and we are executing on actions to deliver higher sales and adjusted EPS with targets to excel through to 2020.  With that, I’d like to hand back to the operator for the Q&A session. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg of UBS. Please go ahead. Jonathan Groberg Hi, thanks a million and congratulations on the end of the year. So, I just have two quick ones, one for you Peer and one for Roland. One, for Peer, can you appreciate some of the initial specifications on GeneReader which sound impressive, I’m wondering if you can give any more concrete expectations for 2017 financially that we might expect from that product? And then Roland for you, we have historically not talked much about as free cash flow, you had a 100% free cash flow conversion of your adjusted net income, I’m just curious is that a one-time phenomenon or is that something we can now expect going forward? Thanks. Peer Schatz Great, thanks Jonathan. So, to the first question, we announced the placements for 2016. We are just shy of 60 placements for the year. For 2017, we expect a significant increase, it’s not 20% or 30% increase, this is a significant increase in placements, but we really want to focus on the market share. We think there are about 500 to 600 systems that are replaced every year and benchtop oncology in 2016, we expect that segment to grow very rapidly over the next few years. And by the year 2020, we expect to have 20% overall market share in this market. So, we're going from a percentage of new placements to an overall market share in that time period. So this is a substantial expansion of the footprint.  We are not really going to see a lot of benefit or we don't really see a lot of benefit of not giving a concrete placement number for 2017 because it is clearly something that is very important competitive information. We will however shed further light on how the roll out improves going forward. It is part of our plan for 2017, you shouldn't expect percentage points of contributions to the overall revenue growth, but it will for the first time be measurable. So this focus that we have is more now in the year 2020 to target a 20% market share. Roland Sackers And the cash flow I think, absolutely I think the free cash flow for $267 million was clearly roughly 22% improvement compared to the year before and I would say also looking forward, we feel I would say quite good about our cash flow generation opportunity because on the one hand side, we I would say you have a nice operation globally where we could see still leverage opportunities and therefore no really significant need for a larger in general capital investments and therefore the cash conversion rates would stay above 100% and as you know we gave all the, I would say good commitment on operating cash flow for 2020 and we are working through that and that should also flow through down to free cash flow as well. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson Hi thanks., Couple on QuantiFERON, can you talk to the degree to which there are other major tenders out there like you saw in Korea? How penetrated is the U.S. market and what’s the impact you think from the new guidelines, and are you still making channel investments there in terms of building up the sales force? Peer Schatz So, the answer to the first part of the question is, yes there are and many countries around the world that are currently looking into segment specific or even broad-based screening efforts and the reason why we announced this tender, it is 350,000 tests it’s obviously a nice size, but wouldn't necessarily warrant publication more from the fact that this was done because this was a highly visible and highly anticipated tender.  Korea is one of the countries that has a higher prevalence of latent TB and at the same time has a very high standard of development clearly, and so this has been watched very closely because there is a very efficient and large-scale initiative underway in Korea to battle latent TB. But there are many other countries around the world, I could list at least a dozen that are currently looking at larger things and many more beyond that. And this was therefore important for us to announce because again as signaling effect, there is a signaling effect from this decision we believe.  In terms of the penetration, the U.S. market is still substantially under penetrated. We believe that it’s maybe a quarter penetrated in some of the are you penetrated segments, but we continue to see new segments emerge that are still at very low penetration levels, so the hospital workers, the healthcare workers is the highest penetration anywhere between 25% and 35%, but you still have even very advanced institutions still working on skin test, and that is why we continue to invest in the sales channels that educate the market and help continue and further accelerate this conversion. Roland? Roland Sackers Yes. I'm not sure if there was - I didn't get a second question for me sorry. Peer Schatz Okay. So, I misunderstood that. Okay. Shall we go to the next one? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve Beuchaw Hi, good morning and good afternoon and thanks for the time here. I wanted to ask just an open-ended question about the outlook for organic growth for 2017, but we’ve clearly seen a lot of improvement in organic growth profile, I think that is in part product and part execution, it seems like, based on the guidance for the second half of 2017, the implied guidance I should say, that it is quite a bit that you see in the funnel maybe it’s tender activity that gives you confidence and this continuing improvement in terms of organic growth. So, I wonder if you could speak to beyond QuantiFERON, which we understand has a really strong trajectory, what else do you see in the order funnel that gives you so much confidence in the acceleration on, let's call it a basis that considers tougher comps in the second half of the year? Thanks so much. Peer Schatz Sure thanks. Well, I think the growth going forward is driven on multiple pillars, so it’s much more differentiated growth engine than it was a few years ago, and that was one of our key goals in the transformation. So QuantiFERON is certainly just because of the size and the high growth of this franchise, a major contributor to the organic growth, but we also have other strong contributors, we mentioned GeneReader before which if you just sum up the numbers and look at the pull-through in terms of consumables that we outlined last time 150,000 to 200,000 in panel throughput per system, even on limited panels. That clearly gives you a good contribution to the overall organic growth.  And on top of that, we, over the last few years have invested heavily in invigorating and targeting our life science franchise to higher growth segments and that was actually a much more significant initiative that meets the eye and also visible from some of the new product launches and the attraction that they are getting and so there is a real exciting range of growth initiatives that are starting to generate significant momentum and contributions. So those would be three larger contributors that we would see you for 2017.  QIAsymphony just continues to be a star and we're winning tenders around the world also in infectious disease and just want to big HIV tender, yesterday and a big hepatitis tender couple of weeks ago. And so we have a very broad menu in Europe that we're marketing throughout all CE relevant regions and that is driving a lot of assay growth and consumables growth and the new capabilities QIAsymphony liquid biopsy just as an example is driving a lot of growth in the U.S. So that focus, the targeting of these on high growth initiatives was not only confined to these very high profile areas, but really is a philosophy that we mirrored into the whole organization. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Scott Bardo Yes, thanks for taking my questions. First one just relates to QIAsymphony; obviously encouraging to see you doing good placements there and you talking about double-digit consumable pull-through. I wonder if you could just give us an update actually as to what the absolute pull-through number is per box now. And really, specifically, if you could give us some sense of what the revenue base, what revenues per division roughly, is QIAsymphony? That would help us understand, or better understand that as a growth driver per the division. So, if you could give us some more color around that, appreciate it. Bigger picture question for Peer, and just with reference to beta sharing and bioinformatics. Obviously, this is a rapidly evolving field. You've seen Phillips now collaborate with Illumina, IBM Watson machine is aggressively moving into the space. So, what I wanted to understand was, do you as QIAGEN have enough, if you like, connectivity and data sharing capabilities to optimize this opportunity in population health and any other direction that this genomic information may take? Thank you. Peer Schatz Roland, do you want to take the QIAsymphony one? Roland Sackers Yes absolutely. And, hi Scott. For the pull-through as we said in November, as well QIAsymphony is the one 80,000 per machine and it is probably as well as an average for the full year at year end. And clearly, if you look on the number of placements, most of them are [indiscernible] so it is probably a little bit more than half. The second area where we had over the last two years of strong performance is clearly within life science applied testing area, and then it fully distributes in general into the Pharma part of the business as well. So, it’s, I would say a fair share in all areas, but more than half in molecular. Peer Schatz Scott you are asking a very good question. The bioinformatics market, well it is still very small is very, very fragmented, and the different tools are very synergistic. So what larger diversified healthcare companies, you mentioned one with Phillips are clearly trying to do, they are trying to create integrated software platforms where the various data creating instruments or units can feed their data into to create a centralized data management and basically also help guide diagnosis and improve outcomes. This is much more comprehensive and not an area that we would go into.  We are sticking to genomic analysis and in genomic analysis this is primarily our capabilities are an interpretation. And this area of interpretation there are several different strategies you can take. You can use literature and we have seen that even the most advanced and we have a lot of work in this area that most advanced artificial intelligence still does not come anywhere close to the curation by physicians and PhD's. And this is why we have an extremely elaborate creation process. We think it will take quite some time to get there and even more time to further establish and validate.  So the literature base, knowledge bases that we have, the algorithms that we’ve created, they can easily be translated to AI and we can upgrade them at some point in time in the future, but that is today an absolute go-to resource and this is why we have, these massive market shares in particular are some clinical interpretation, but also in the life sciences. And the second is, then the data sharing capabilities and to create these repositories and be able to data mine and OmicSoft surprisingly with a very small revenue base and size of a company has signed up the most prestigious institutions around the world to create these types of data repository and mining capabilities.  So our strategy is to be very, very focused and not venture out into areas that we think other companies in IT will be able to address and stay very close to our molecular Sample to Insight core philosophy and capabilities. And in those areas we have very high market shares. And that I think we see a lot of things happening are actually good for our industry because they will allow us to further plug into this increasing momentum that everybody is building. Operator Our next question from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank, please go ahead.  Daniel Wendorff  Thanks for taking my questions. Two small follow-ups, to be honest. One with regards to the QIAsymphony placement; you are targeting more than 2,000 total placements until the end of the year. I wonder if you could give us any idea of what the total amount might be you would be able to place. I think I recall from the past that you said something like 3,000, a bit more than 3,000, has this changed now? With NGS coming into play? And second question would be a follow-up question on the GeneReader. If you look at the numbers you placed in 2016, can you potentially quantify what were straight sales and what amount of machines you placed on your new PPI model? That would be helpful, thank you. Peer Schatz Right. The reason why I was struggling - sorry for interjecting - is because GeneReader continues just to be an extraordinary and we had once again a significant over performance in QIAsymphony in 2016 in head to head competitive wins across all of the different disease areas in Europe, and Europe is a totally different market than the United States in terms of what wins and what doesn't. And in the U.S. we have such an outstanding set of capabilities that we are continually also expanding and upgrading in terms of - we have today hundreds of protocols for QIAsymphony.  I think on cell-free DNA we think even have, I think there are 180 different variants that we are offering customers and because people have different downstream assays in different specifications. It is just such a versatile and broad capability system that we currently in our five-year projections do not see that this will significantly taper off over the next years and so what we get guided for was at least 200 systems on average per year over the next few years, and that I think was a conservative number that we are targeting through 2020, and thereafter I think this will continue.  I wouldn't be surprised if QIAsymphony is around another 10 years. It’s a very strong platform. In terms of the GeneReader just to, the majority are price per insight that has been very positively received model by our customers and so that that will start reflecting in our P&L once they start running the panels. Roland Sackers And I think it is also done, just to add on to that, to the question we had before in terms of revenue impact in 2016 and 2017, so as [indiscernible] Consumables the story, you can see the actuation is clearly something what was driven by the consumer one with all the close of 2016 and moving into 2018 and beyond. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin Hi good morning. Peer Schatz Good morning, Derik. Derik de Bruin  So a couple questions. One, can you quantify the OmicSoft revenues? And on the second point, what was the organic revenue growth number ex acquisitions in the academic market? Looks, by my calculation, looks like it was negative this quarter, and I guess could you sort of talk about what's going on in the academic world right now from your perspective? Obviously there's a lot of moving parts in terms of government funding both in the U.S. and abroad. Thanks. Peer Schatz Right. So for OmicSoft, we put in the press release that it would add maybe half a percentage point of revenue to 2017 because we bought it earlier in the year that would be pretty much a full year number. The reason why we are a little bit vague on it is because as always there are products within the portfolio that we might want to discontinue because the company is very close to what we are doing and some of the products might be an overlap and so this is something that we are currently evaluating if and how we should position that, but in general it’s not really material for the overall year, and with half a percentage point it would already be a very good number.  So, in terms of the academic markets, indeed the academic markets in particular in Europe, but also partly in the United States were choppy. We had continued weakness in the European Academia markets that we saw less so in the second and third quarter, more in the fourth quarter, but we attribute this more to temporary effects in Europe versus in the United States there is definitely an uneasiness in the U.S. academic markets. Also questioning what the long term trajectory of funding will be in this area and so there is some nervousness in the U.S. academic sector. That, those two factors led to a softer Q4 in Academia, but we don't see this as something that we would expect to have to continue into 2017. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Please go ahead. Brian Weinstein Hi guys, thank you for taking the questions. One short term and one longer term question. On the short term, I just want to make sure I understand the Q1 guide being kind of 4% to 5% CER in the full year, higher than that. As I understand, HPV is a bigger impact in Q1, but is there anything else that we should be specifically considering as a headwind in the first quarter? And then longer term, Roland, for you, you've done a nice job with cash flow, it's just around $350 million this year, but can you go over again how that bridges to the $600 million that you were expecting for 2020? Thank you.  Peer Schatz Roland? Roland Yes, let me start this second one on the cash flow generation, as you said, I would say it is clearly a good story in terms of both working capital improvements and I would say single biggest driver over the next year will be clearly inventory management, as you know especially 2016, I would say we were still not there. We would say an average year could be costs driven by transformations by transformations and in-sourcing of productions around QuantiFERON, so you work with the larger inventory stock. You clearly had a year with a significant instrumentation introduction, that also typically something what you want to increases inventory levels. So I would believe over time, our inventory levels from around 160 days can go down to 110 days and therefore I would say that it is one single, quite significant contributor first of all.  And second one is clearly a general cash conversion and those take a very positive as you have seen the results, an overall 12% CAGR on the EPS line until the 2012, including 2020. And if you just more or less take that as a basis, you can see and expecting a very reasonable CapEx spending what we're having right now want 4% that we would be getting there without any larger stretch and therefore I would say that is something where we have seen not only last year, especially in the fourth quarter, but also in the quarters before that the cash conversion ratio in cash is very positive and of course heavy mindset, of course I would say in the first two quarters. This year we will see some payouts from the restructuring, that were recorded last year, cash balances have been this year, but besides that impact I would say we are continuing to see it directly going forward as well. And your first question was on? Brian Weinstein First quarter. Roland Sackers First quarter, again, let me just remind you that in general we see a similar pattern that we have seen last year. We anticipate having about 47% of total in H1 versus 53 in the second part of the year and that is trends you have seen largely also in the last three years. So, I would say very well aligned and with the explanation Peer has given before there is clearly a lot of growth coming not only on QuantiFERON and GeneReader, but also the new production implementations within life science. We actually feel quite confident in moving into the year and I would say it is a little bit too early to increase that guidance before we even ask to the first quarter, but I would say the confidence level is good. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citi. Please go ahead. Dan Arias Good morning guys, thanks. Peer, just a follow-up on the answer - the answer to the question on QIAsymphony. Do you feel like the next tranche of placements this year kind of has the same geographic mix as what you've done to date, or are you expecting the U.S. proportion to be larger, or I guess maybe smaller giving the EU momentum? Just some curiosity on the regional expectations there. And then if I could ask a follow up, sounds like you're feeling pretty good about the comparative metrics on the GeneReader, do you feel like this is a year where it will start to see some published or presented data either on performance or cost relative to the other platforms, that kind of to your point drives home the message on the advantages of the platform? Thanks. Peer Schatz Right thanks Dan. So, first question on QIAsymphony, the mix and I have to go back to the exact numbers, but it is pretty much 40, 40, 20; I mean 40, US; 40, Europe; and 20, rest of the world and there is obviously volatility in that depending on larger orders and tenders and intra year trends. But the - so the placements of QIAsymphony are pretty even across the world. In Europe however it’s used as an integrated, fully integrated molecular diagnostic platform where people are running QIAGEN HIV tests, QIAGEN Hepatitis tests, and QIAGEN hospital-acquired infections and so on. And in the United States it is primarily running sample technologies. So, upfront to PCR, upfront to NGS, upfront to arrays, and - so the use is very different. In Asia, it is a targeted menu of approved tests as well, less broaden in Europe.  So the actual placements of the QIAsymphony SP front-end system is going to be pretty comparable I guess. The consumables turn is more weighted to Europe because we are adding in addition to the sample technology, also the test. In terms of the GeneReader, yes you have already seen in the fourth quarter, first papers come out demonstrating the performance, so there were presentations and posters, about a handful. And there are several conferences coming up now in the first quarter, and in 2016 what we did was an enormous enormously targeted launch only with one panel with a very targeted customer group, tightly controlling the message and many of them have been generating data. And this is what you will start seeing coming out.  And just maybe for the broader audience here QIAsymphony targets a segment of next-generation sequencing, but it does in this segment an extremely good job, it is not a whole genome or whole exome platform or more for exploratory sequencing, it is a purpose-built clinical panel sequence and in this area really excels. So, I think the number on the accuracy that I just noted and some of you might have noted that that we are now routinely demonstrating Q60 accuracies, which is really a substantial improvement and this is a combination of the sequence of the panel technology and Informatics, everything. So the two hour power of the fully integrated Sample to Insight solution coming to play. Operator And our last question for today comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan  Hi thanks for squeezing me in. Peer, could you discuss some of the trends you're seeing in the assay revenues within personalized medicine and any update of views you have on the reimbursement rate environment? And then for Roland, just any changes to the plan for headcount within sales organization investment? Investment there for the year? Thank you. Peer Schatz So you are right to point out that as an area that is very murky at the moment, difficult to interpret, and we have actually seen that as a positive because our well validated FDA approved CE marked highly validated tests where we actually did cost-effectiveness studies and have very solid reimbursements in most countries around the world. The therascreen PCR test, they are actually very solidly performing, and we are adding new test to the portfolio. We for instance launched a new Cal-R test, which is used in the area of blood cancer. So, we have a very strong franchise in Europe and the rest of the world also in the United States. And this is going to continue. So I think that religion war, will it be PCR assays or NGS assays? The two will be used concurrently and we are actually seeing customers run both of our families of products in parallel and for - and just basically optimizing the use of both.  I wouldn't expect a significant change for 2017 in this area, and the fact that we actually had the LDT guidance, get removed is possibly something that payers will have to deal with at some point. So, we see that the payers will probably prefer more validated test going forward if FDA is not going to regulate some of these tests. So, we don't see a negative for the existing franchise, we actually see a positive for some of our GeneReader assays where a lot of these platforms are used in combination with LDTs. Roland Sackers And on the sales and marketing expenses, it’s what I had said clearly are of course make dedicated and focused investments in areas we expect incremental growth. And as we said during the call, QuantiFERON is clearly one area where we expect it for quite a long time. At the same time it is quite obvious that they have other areas where we now will see, especially with efforts we have done over the last few weeks and months contributions going forward as well. And therefore I would say that relatively the costs are going to improve and therefore you will notice from the outside any investments, you would rather see it probably the absolute numbers stays quite fixed on the same absolute level over the next few quarters, but within that of course there is an ongoing allocation into areas where we expect an incremental growth going forward. Peer Schatz So with that I would like to close the call and as the last plan, I would like to mention that QIAGEN would be at the Association for Association for Molecular Pathology meeting in Berlin from April 3 to 5. There is going to be an important clinical genomics conference in Berlin. And look forward to any of you who are able to attend that conference and chance to meeting in person in Germany.  And with that, I would like to close this call and thank all of you for your participation. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Roland Sackers And the cash flow I think, absolutely I think the free cash flow for $267 million was clearly roughly 22% improvement compared to the year before and I would say also looking forward, we feel I would say quite good about our cash flow generation opportunity because on the one hand side, we I would say you have a nice operation globally where we could see still leverage opportunities and therefore no really significant need for a larger in general capital investments and therefore the cash conversion rates would stay above 100% and as you know we gave all the, I would say good commitment on operating cash flow for 2020 and we are working through that and that should also flow through down to free cash flow as well. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson Hi thanks., Couple on QuantiFERON, can you talk to the degree to which there are other major tenders out there like you saw in Korea? How penetrated is the U.S. market and what’s the impact you think from the new guidelines, and are you still making channel investments there in terms of building up the sales force? Peer Schatz So, the answer to the first part of the question is, yes there are and many countries around the world that are currently looking into segment specific or even broad-based screening efforts and the reason why we announced this tender, it is 350,000 tests it’s obviously a nice size, but wouldn't necessarily warrant publication more from the fact that this was done because this was a highly visible and highly anticipated tender.  Korea is one of the countries that has a higher prevalence of latent TB and at the same time has a very high standard of development clearly, and so this has been watched very closely because there is a very efficient and large-scale initiative underway in Korea to battle latent TB. But there are many other countries around the world, I could list at least a dozen that are currently looking at larger things and many more beyond that. And this was therefore important for us to announce because again as signaling effect, there is a signaling effect from this decision we believe.  In terms of the penetration, the U.S. market is still substantially under penetrated. We believe that it’s maybe a quarter penetrated in some of the are you penetrated segments, but we continue to see new segments emerge that are still at very low penetration levels, so the hospital workers, the healthcare workers is the highest penetration anywhere between 25% and 35%, but you still have even very advanced institutions still working on skin test, and that is why we continue to invest in the sales channels that educate the market and help continue and further accelerate this conversion. Roland? Roland Sackers Yes. I'm not sure if there was - I didn't get a second question for me sorry. Peer Schatz Okay. So, I misunderstood that. Okay. Shall we go to the next one? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve Beuchaw Hi, good morning and good afternoon and thanks for the time here. I wanted to ask just an open-ended question about the outlook for organic growth for 2017, but we’ve clearly seen a lot of improvement in organic growth profile, I think that is in part product and part execution, it seems like, based on the guidance for the second half of 2017, the implied guidance I should say, that it is quite a bit that you see in the funnel maybe it’s tender activity that gives you confidence and this continuing improvement in terms of organic growth. So, I wonder if you could speak to beyond QuantiFERON, which we understand has a really strong trajectory, what else do you see in the order funnel that gives you so much confidence in the acceleration on, let's call it a basis that considers tougher comps in the second half of the year? Thanks so much. Peer Schatz Sure thanks. Well, I think the growth going forward is driven on multiple pillars, so it’s much more differentiated growth engine than it was a few years ago, and that was one of our key goals in the transformation. So QuantiFERON is certainly just because of the size and the high growth of this franchise, a major contributor to the organic growth, but we also have other strong contributors, we mentioned GeneReader before which if you just sum up the numbers and look at the pull-through in terms of consumables that we outlined last time 150,000 to 200,000 in panel throughput per system, even on limited panels. That clearly gives you a good contribution to the overall organic growth.  And on top of that, we, over the last few years have invested heavily in invigorating and targeting our life science franchise to higher growth segments and that was actually a much more significant initiative that meets the eye and also visible from some of the new product launches and the attraction that they are getting and so there is a real exciting range of growth initiatives that are starting to generate significant momentum and contributions. So those would be three larger contributors that we would see you for 2017.  QIAsymphony just continues to be a star and we're winning tenders around the world also in infectious disease and just want to big HIV tender, yesterday and a big hepatitis tender couple of weeks ago. And so we have a very broad menu in Europe that we're marketing throughout all CE relevant regions and that is driving a lot of assay growth and consumables growth and the new capabilities QIAsymphony liquid biopsy just as an example is driving a lot of growth in the U.S. So that focus, the targeting of these on high growth initiatives was not only confined to these very high profile areas, but really is a philosophy that we mirrored into the whole organization. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Scott Bardo Yes, thanks for taking my questions. First one just relates to QIAsymphony; obviously encouraging to see you doing good placements there and you talking about double-digit consumable pull-through. I wonder if you could just give us an update actually as to what the absolute pull-through number is per box now. And really, specifically, if you could give us some sense of what the revenue base, what revenues per division roughly, is QIAsymphony? That would help us understand, or better understand that as a growth driver per the division. So, if you could give us some more color around that, appreciate it. Bigger picture question for Peer, and just with reference to beta sharing and bioinformatics. Obviously, this is a rapidly evolving field. You've seen Phillips now collaborate with Illumina, IBM Watson machine is aggressively moving into the space. So, what I wanted to understand was, do you as QIAGEN have enough, if you like, connectivity and data sharing capabilities to optimize this opportunity in population health and any other direction that this genomic information may take? Thank you. Peer Schatz Roland, do you want to take the QIAsymphony one? Roland Sackers Yes absolutely. And, hi Scott. For the pull-through as we said in November, as well QIAsymphony is the one 80,000 per machine and it is probably as well as an average for the full year at year end. And clearly, if you look on the number of placements, most of them are [indiscernible] so it is probably a little bit more than half. The second area where we had over the last two years of strong performance is clearly within life science applied testing area, and then it fully distributes in general into the Pharma part of the business as well. So, it’s, I would say a fair share in all areas, but more than half in molecular. Peer Schatz Scott you are asking a very good question. The bioinformatics market, well it is still very small is very, very fragmented, and the different tools are very synergistic. So what larger diversified healthcare companies, you mentioned one with Phillips are clearly trying to do, they are trying to create integrated software platforms where the various data creating instruments or units can feed their data into to create a centralized data management and basically also help guide diagnosis and improve outcomes. This is much more comprehensive and not an area that we would go into.  We are sticking to genomic analysis and in genomic analysis this is primarily our capabilities are an interpretation. And this area of interpretation there are several different strategies you can take. You can use literature and we have seen that even the most advanced and we have a lot of work in this area that most advanced artificial intelligence still does not come anywhere close to the curation by physicians and PhD's. And this is why we have an extremely elaborate creation process. We think it will take quite some time to get there and even more time to further establish and validate.  So the literature base, knowledge bases that we have, the algorithms that we’ve created, they can easily be translated to AI and we can upgrade them at some point in time in the future, but that is today an absolute go-to resource and this is why we have, these massive market shares in particular are some clinical interpretation, but also in the life sciences. And the second is, then the data sharing capabilities and to create these repositories and be able to data mine and OmicSoft surprisingly with a very small revenue base and size of a company has signed up the most prestigious institutions around the world to create these types of data repository and mining capabilities.  So our strategy is to be very, very focused and not venture out into areas that we think other companies in IT will be able to address and stay very close to our molecular Sample to Insight core philosophy and capabilities. And in those areas we have very high market shares. And that I think we see a lot of things happening are actually good for our industry because they will allow us to further plug into this increasing momentum that everybody is building. Operator Our next question from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank, please go ahead.  Daniel Wendorff  Thanks for taking my questions. Two small follow-ups, to be honest. One with regards to the QIAsymphony placement; you are targeting more than 2,000 total placements until the end of the year. I wonder if you could give us any idea of what the total amount might be you would be able to place. I think I recall from the past that you said something like 3,000, a bit more than 3,000, has this changed now? With NGS coming into play? And second question would be a follow-up question on the GeneReader. If you look at the numbers you placed in 2016, can you potentially quantify what were straight sales and what amount of machines you placed on your new PPI model? That would be helpful, thank you. Peer Schatz Right. The reason why I was struggling - sorry for interjecting - is because GeneReader continues just to be an extraordinary and we had once again a significant over performance in QIAsymphony in 2016 in head to head competitive wins across all of the different disease areas in Europe, and Europe is a totally different market than the United States in terms of what wins and what doesn't. And in the U.S. we have such an outstanding set of capabilities that we are continually also expanding and upgrading in terms of - we have today hundreds of protocols for QIAsymphony.  I think on cell-free DNA we think even have, I think there are 180 different variants that we are offering customers and because people have different downstream assays in different specifications. It is just such a versatile and broad capability system that we currently in our five-year projections do not see that this will significantly taper off over the next years and so what we get guided for was at least 200 systems on average per year over the next few years, and that I think was a conservative number that we are targeting through 2020, and thereafter I think this will continue.  I wouldn't be surprised if QIAsymphony is around another 10 years. It’s a very strong platform. In terms of the GeneReader just to, the majority are price per insight that has been very positively received model by our customers and so that that will start reflecting in our P&L once they start running the panels. Roland Sackers And I think it is also done, just to add on to that, to the question we had before in terms of revenue impact in 2016 and 2017, so as [indiscernible] Consumables the story, you can see the actuation is clearly something what was driven by the consumer one with all the close of 2016 and moving into 2018 and beyond. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin Hi good morning. Peer Schatz Good morning, Derik. Derik de Bruin  So a couple questions. One, can you quantify the OmicSoft revenues? And on the second point, what was the organic revenue growth number ex acquisitions in the academic market? Looks, by my calculation, looks like it was negative this quarter, and I guess could you sort of talk about what's going on in the academic world right now from your perspective? Obviously there's a lot of moving parts in terms of government funding both in the U.S. and abroad. Thanks. Peer Schatz Right. So for OmicSoft, we put in the press release that it would add maybe half a percentage point of revenue to 2017 because we bought it earlier in the year that would be pretty much a full year number. The reason why we are a little bit vague on it is because as always there are products within the portfolio that we might want to discontinue because the company is very close to what we are doing and some of the products might be an overlap and so this is something that we are currently evaluating if and how we should position that, but in general it’s not really material for the overall year, and with half a percentage point it would already be a very good number.  So, in terms of the academic markets, indeed the academic markets in particular in Europe, but also partly in the United States were choppy. We had continued weakness in the European Academia markets that we saw less so in the second and third quarter, more in the fourth quarter, but we attribute this more to temporary effects in Europe versus in the United States there is definitely an uneasiness in the U.S. academic markets. Also questioning what the long term trajectory of funding will be in this area and so there is some nervousness in the U.S. academic sector. That, those two factors led to a softer Q4 in Academia, but we don't see this as something that we would expect to have to continue into 2017. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Please go ahead. Brian Weinstein Hi guys, thank you for taking the questions. One short term and one longer term question. On the short term, I just want to make sure I understand the Q1 guide being kind of 4% to 5% CER in the full year, higher than that. As I understand, HPV is a bigger impact in Q1, but is there anything else that we should be specifically considering as a headwind in the first quarter? And then longer term, Roland, for you, you've done a nice job with cash flow, it's just around $350 million this year, but can you go over again how that bridges to the $600 million that you were expecting for 2020? Thank you.  Peer Schatz Roland? Roland Yes, let me start this second one on the cash flow generation, as you said, I would say it is clearly a good story in terms of both working capital improvements and I would say single biggest driver over the next year will be clearly inventory management, as you know especially 2016, I would say we were still not there. We would say an average year could be costs driven by transformations by transformations and in-sourcing of productions around QuantiFERON, so you work with the larger inventory stock. You clearly had a year with a significant instrumentation introduction, that also typically something what you want to increases inventory levels. So I would believe over time, our inventory levels from around 160 days can go down to 110 days and therefore I would say that it is one single, quite significant contributor first of all.  And second one is clearly a general cash conversion and those take a very positive as you have seen the results, an overall 12% CAGR on the EPS line until the 2012, including 2020. And if you just more or less take that as a basis, you can see and expecting a very reasonable CapEx spending what we're having right now want 4% that we would be getting there without any larger stretch and therefore I would say that is something where we have seen not only last year, especially in the fourth quarter, but also in the quarters before that the cash conversion ratio in cash is very positive and of course heavy mindset, of course I would say in the first two quarters. This year we will see some payouts from the restructuring, that were recorded last year, cash balances have been this year, but besides that impact I would say we are continuing to see it directly going forward as well. And your first question was on? Brian Weinstein First quarter. Roland Sackers First quarter, again, let me just remind you that in general we see a similar pattern that we have seen last year. We anticipate having about 47% of total in H1 versus 53 in the second part of the year and that is trends you have seen largely also in the last three years. So, I would say very well aligned and with the explanation Peer has given before there is clearly a lot of growth coming not only on QuantiFERON and GeneReader, but also the new production implementations within life science. We actually feel quite confident in moving into the year and I would say it is a little bit too early to increase that guidance before we even ask to the first quarter, but I would say the confidence level is good. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citi. Please go ahead. Dan Arias Good morning guys, thanks. Peer, just a follow-up on the answer - the answer to the question on QIAsymphony. Do you feel like the next tranche of placements this year kind of has the same geographic mix as what you've done to date, or are you expecting the U.S. proportion to be larger, or I guess maybe smaller giving the EU momentum? Just some curiosity on the regional expectations there. And then if I could ask a follow up, sounds like you're feeling pretty good about the comparative metrics on the GeneReader, do you feel like this is a year where it will start to see some published or presented data either on performance or cost relative to the other platforms, that kind of to your point drives home the message on the advantages of the platform? Thanks. Peer Schatz Right thanks Dan. So, first question on QIAsymphony, the mix and I have to go back to the exact numbers, but it is pretty much 40, 40, 20; I mean 40, US; 40, Europe; and 20, rest of the world and there is obviously volatility in that depending on larger orders and tenders and intra year trends. But the - so the placements of QIAsymphony are pretty even across the world. In Europe however it’s used as an integrated, fully integrated molecular diagnostic platform where people are running QIAGEN HIV tests, QIAGEN Hepatitis tests, and QIAGEN hospital-acquired infections and so on. And in the United States it is primarily running sample technologies. So, upfront to PCR, upfront to NGS, upfront to arrays, and - so the use is very different. In Asia, it is a targeted menu of approved tests as well, less broaden in Europe.  So the actual placements of the QIAsymphony SP front-end system is going to be pretty comparable I guess. The consumables turn is more weighted to Europe because we are adding in addition to the sample technology, also the test. In terms of the GeneReader, yes you have already seen in the fourth quarter, first papers come out demonstrating the performance, so there were presentations and posters, about a handful. And there are several conferences coming up now in the first quarter, and in 2016 what we did was an enormous enormously targeted launch only with one panel with a very targeted customer group, tightly controlling the message and many of them have been generating data. And this is what you will start seeing coming out.  And just maybe for the broader audience here QIAsymphony targets a segment of next-generation sequencing, but it does in this segment an extremely good job, it is not a whole genome or whole exome platform or more for exploratory sequencing, it is a purpose-built clinical panel sequence and in this area really excels. So, I think the number on the accuracy that I just noted and some of you might have noted that that we are now routinely demonstrating Q60 accuracies, which is really a substantial improvement and this is a combination of the sequence of the panel technology and Informatics, everything. So the two hour power of the fully integrated Sample to Insight solution coming to play. Operator And our last question for today comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan  Hi thanks for squeezing me in. Peer, could you discuss some of the trends you're seeing in the assay revenues within personalized medicine and any update of views you have on the reimbursement rate environment? And then for Roland, just any changes to the plan for headcount within sales organization investment? Investment there for the year? Thank you. Peer Schatz So you are right to point out that as an area that is very murky at the moment, difficult to interpret, and we have actually seen that as a positive because our well validated FDA approved CE marked highly validated tests where we actually did cost-effectiveness studies and have very solid reimbursements in most countries around the world. The therascreen PCR test, they are actually very solidly performing, and we are adding new test to the portfolio. We for instance launched a new Cal-R test, which is used in the area of blood cancer. So, we have a very strong franchise in Europe and the rest of the world also in the United States. And this is going to continue. So I think that religion war, will it be PCR assays or NGS assays? The two will be used concurrently and we are actually seeing customers run both of our families of products in parallel and for - and just basically optimizing the use of both.  I wouldn't expect a significant change for 2017 in this area, and the fact that we actually had the LDT guidance, get removed is possibly something that payers will have to deal with at some point. So, we see that the payers will probably prefer more validated test going forward if FDA is not going to regulate some of these tests. So, we don't see a negative for the existing franchise, we actually see a positive for some of our GeneReader assays where a lot of these platforms are used in combination with LDTs. Roland Sackers And on the sales and marketing expenses, it’s what I had said clearly are of course make dedicated and focused investments in areas we expect incremental growth. And as we said during the call, QuantiFERON is clearly one area where we expect it for quite a long time. At the same time it is quite obvious that they have other areas where we now will see, especially with efforts we have done over the last few weeks and months contributions going forward as well. And therefore I would say that relatively the costs are going to improve and therefore you will notice from the outside any investments, you would rather see it probably the absolute numbers stays quite fixed on the same absolute level over the next few quarters, but within that of course there is an ongoing allocation into areas where we expect an incremental growth going forward. Peer Schatz So with that I would like to close the call and as the last plan, I would like to mention that QIAGEN would be at the Association for Association for Molecular Pathology meeting in Berlin from April 3 to 5. There is going to be an important clinical genomics conference in Berlin. And look forward to any of you who are able to attend that conference and chance to meeting in person in Germany.  And with that, I would like to close this call and thank all of you for your participation. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer, Greg Maffei. Please go ahead. Greg Maffei Hi, it’s Greg Maffei, good morning and thanks for joining us today. We remained busy in Q3 and we’ve had several ups and downs over the past three months and I am looking forward to sharing them with you this morning. Today, I am going to talk a little bit about those recent events at Liberty and also discuss briefly the operating performance the assets and business has attributed to the LINTB and LCAPB tracking stocks. On the call today, we have our Chairman, John Malone; QVC's CEO Mike George and CFO Dan O'Connell; Starz’s Chairman and CEO, Bob Clasen; President and COO Bill Myers; and EVP and CFO, Glen Curtis. And we also have several of my fellow senior Liberty Executives who will also be available to answer questions after the prepared remarks portion of the call.  Our first speaker on the call is going to be our Controller at Liberty Chris Shean is going to describe Liberty Interactive's result and Liberty Capital's results and also the liquidity picture of both of the attributed tracking stock. Then we will have QVC's CEO Mike George talk about recent developments at QVC, followed by Starz CEO Bob Clasen talk about recent events at Starz.  But I am going to highlight a couple of the other developments at the corporate level and some of you may remember we on October 23rd our shareholders approved the issuance of two new tracking stocks.  The first to be Liberty Entertainment has attributed assets that include our expected 40% stake in DirecTV, three regional sports networks those being in the Northwest, Rocky Mountain in Pittsburgh, Starz Entertainment, FUN Technologies are 53% of FUN Technologies, our 50% interest in GSN formerly the Game Show Network, and our approximately 33% interest in WildBlue satellite company.  In addition the Liberty Entertainment tracker will have about 551 of attributed exchangeable debt and about $1.87 billion of cash. So thinking about that new Liberty Entertainment attributed equity I want to first highlight how pleased we are with the excellent performance at DirecTV. They had a very strong quarter, growth adds up, churn down, net adds up, ARPU up. Clearly, the move to high-def and DVRs is requiring capital, but it's paying off with high quality subs. And we expect at the direct management team, that hardware costs are going to continue to fall, reducing the cost of upgrades and that they are working and will be successful to reduce the cost of truckloads and installs. The regional sports networks, they were also going to be receiving in the expected News Corp. deal are also performing well. Good ratings of the (inaudible) performance and the Rockies performance. I think most importantly related to these assets, we are looking forward to closing that deal and moving towards the next phase of Liberty Entertainment. The new Liberty Capital will have the remaining attributed assets, business and liabilities that were previously attributed to Liberty Capital, other than those that I just mentioned that are being attributed to Liberty Entertainment. These new trackers are expected to be issued immediately after the completion of our exchange with News Corp. Just to highlight again, the purpose of these trackers is, first, to reduce complexity, particularly at Liberty Entertainment. To allow investors to further focus their capital in the equity that they find most attractive. To create a currency, particularly Liberty Entertainment, for enhanced dimensional flexibility and to further concentrate our remaining non-core assets at the new Liberty Capital. Couple of other highlights to note during the quarter. Yesterday, at FUN Technologies we reached a definitive agreement to acquire the outstanding 43%. That agreement was unanimously approved by the independent directors. Turning now to some of the operations at Liberty Capital. Revenue growth at Starz and the ongoing reduction of programming costs led to very satisfying increases in OCF. We are very pleased with that. We are also pleased with strong operating results in several of our other Liberty Capital affiliates, including the Braves. At Liberty Interactive, just to highlight first we are not yet planning any changes today in the Liberty Interactive tracking stock and they are not impacted. Liberty Interactive's tracking stock is not impacted by any of the creation of the two new tracking stocks at Liberty Capital. On an operating basis, clearly, we are disappointed with the continued soft QVC. QVC US had weak performance across many product categories in a difficult market. QVC International had good performance then UK, quite strong quarter. But, weaker performance in Germany and Japan, which continue to encounter difficulties. Mike George will talk about those business in far more detail in a moment. While we are disappointed with those operations, we remained quite appreciative of the free cash flow generation capabilities in that Q. During the quarter, driven primarily by that, we repurchased about $500 million of equity since Q2 ended at Liberty Interactive. Today we estimate that excluding the public stakes that are in Liberty Interactive and taking those stakes at market, Q is trading at above 8 times expected 2008 EBITDA and this doesn't take account of obviously its larger free cash flow generation capabilities which are very positive, relative with EBITDA stream. Since we issued those tracking stocks, the initial set back in May of '06, we bought back more than 14% of the common stock at Liberty Interactive. And recently our Board authorized a purchase of up to an additional $1 billion. We still have under 4 times leverage on a net debt, both trailing and on pro forma at Liberty Interactive. So, we are enthused about the opportunity to potentially shrink more equity. We also at Liberty Interactive had saw the operating growth year-to-date at Provide, Backcountry and BUYSEASONS, our three e-commerce businesses. And lastly to talk about a development at Liberty Interactive, I think we are quite pleased with Barry Diller's plan split up of IEC. I think first that highlights the value of the components there, which we don't think had been fully recognized in the marketplace, and I think it will allow us to begin a dialogue with IC about how we are going to work together in the next phase of our relationship, not sure where that's going to turn out, but expect it will be positive. So, with those comments, let me turn it over to Chris to talk more about the operations. Chris Shean Thanks, Greg. Let's start by taking a look at Liberty Interactive. This quick snapshot of the third quarter revenue and OCF performance, indicates that Liberty Interactive's attributed businesses continued at a slower pace of revenue growth and experienced a decline in operating cash flow during the third quarter. QVC is the principal driver performance among Liberty Interactive's attributed assets and its performance was sluggish. This was primarily driven by the continuation of difficult market conditions, challenging comparisons to last year's strong results from the same period and continuing operational challenges at QVC's international businesses, most notably in Japan and Germany. I'll talk a bit more about this shortly. Looking more closely at Liberty Interactive, overall, LINTA's businesses achieved 4% revenue growth and experienced a 1% decline in operating cash flow. As I will discuss in a bit more detail in a moment. The pace of revenue growth remains slow at QVC and operating cash flow declined during the third quarter. Provide Commerce and BUYSEASONS which were acquired in 2006, experienced modest year-over-year revenue growth during the period had shown solid year-to-date revenue in operating cash flow gains. Backcountry which was acquired in June and is included in the third quarter result, doubled it's revenue during the quarter, I guess as compared to it's pre-acquisition prior year quarter and has experienced strong year-to-date gains in revenue and operating cash flow.  As Greg mentioned earlier, we continue to repurchase Atlanta shares during the quarter we bought back 14.9 million shares for $289 million. This coupled with our repurchases in October brings our total repurchases for the year to more than 46 million shares and over $1 billion. Since inception of the Atlanta share repurchase program, we have now reacquired over 14% of the outstanding shares.  We continue to believe in share repurchase as a solid means of enhancing shareholder value and will continue to evaluate opportunity to cost effectively shrink Atlanta equity. To that end, our Board recently approved the repurchase of an additional $1 billion Liberty Interactive stock buyback announcement. Taking a closer look at the quarterly performance of QVC. QVC experienced consolidated revenue growth of 2% to $1.69 billion during the quarter and 1% decline in the OCF to $364 million. Domestic revenue grew 2% in the second quarter to $1.17 billion. The slower growth reflects softness across most major product categories. Total unit shift increased 1% for the quarter to $28 million while the average selling price grew 1% to $45.89. Domestic OCF increased 2% for the quarter to $278 million, while the OCF margin was largely unchanged at 23.7%. Dot-com sales continue to grow as a percentage of overall domestic sales, rising from 19% in the third quarter last year to 21% this year. International revenue increased 2% to $512 million for the quarter, while OCF declined 8% to $86 million. The revenue growth was due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates in the UK and Germany, partially offset by lower average selling prices in all the QVC internationals markets. Operational challenges in Germany and the ongoing affect of changes in the enforcement of Japan's regulation of the marketing of health and beauty aids in that country. The operating cash flow decline, was due to lower gross margins that were the result of higher product distribution costs and higher operating costs in the areas of commissions, customer service and SG&A expenses. Excluding the affect of exchange rates international revenue declined 3%, while OCF declined 10%. QVC Germany and Japan as expected continue to experience challenges. The German business was affected by productivity challenges across most categories. Those contributed to a modest decline in the ASP, average selling price and a reduction in unit's shift that resulted in an 11% local currency revenue decline. QVC Germany also experienced a lower gross margin and higher operating cost percentage. Lower gross margin percentage was due to a lower initial product margin and higher product distribution costs. QVC Japan experienced a 3.2% local currency revenue reduction as lower ASPs were partially offset by unit increases. QVC Japan management continue to ship product away from the health and beauty category to the apparel and accessories categories; home and jewelry, and experienced productivity gains in each of these categories to which it receive ship the product. On more positive note we continue to experience improved results in the UK where QVC produced 9.3% local currency revenue growth and even larger gains in operating cash flow.  Before I walk through the Liberty Interactive liquidity picture I am going to turn the call over to QVC's President and CEO Mike George who will discuss QVCs operation in more detail and talk a bit about some of the new initiatives the company launched in the third quarter. Mike? Mike George Thanks Chris. As Chris mentioned I'll provide a little additional background on the Q3 result and then give you a brief update on some of the growth initiatives that we've been driving. In the US as Chris described we saw continuation of the soft business trend that began in late April. With most merchandised categories underperforming our expectations. However, while the sales results were clearly sub par consistent with our long-term approach to the business, we avoided turning the pricing or promotions to artificially inflate the top line. As a result we were able to keep gross margin rates relatively flat for last year, contain expenses and grow EBITDA consistent with sales. And even if this soft business trend continues we are committed to sustain out of the promotional fray in the holiday season and believe we can maintain stable gross margin rates in this environment. With the weak retail environment in the US clearly impacting our result, we need to raise our game to outperform. We are focused on that, we are focused on continuing to enhance our assortments and brands, creating engaging programming and dot-com experiences, and most importantly, ensuring strong day-to-day execution of the business fundamentals. And of course, we will continue to focus on tight expense and inventory management to avoid any significant fluctuations in our margin rates and profitability. Turning to Germany. The results were poor on both the top-line and the bottom-line. Sales were hurt by our efforts to reduce reliance on a small number of core brands that have been over rotated. And ASPs and margins were impacted by some markdowns we needed to take to clear up underperforming inventory, especially in the apparel zone. In Germany, as we have discussed on prior calls, we are focused on the fundamentals of cleaning up the inventory, diversifying the product and programming mix, we had been overly dependent on a few categories in the past, and moving our business away from promotional price points. And we remain confident that we will make progress against those goals over the next several months. However, as I mentioned in our last call, I don't want to try to predict the timings of a turnaround until we know we can deliver on it. So, we'll stay focused on key milestones and just moving the business towards a healthier long-term model for the business. The Japan story remains largely the same as the last two quarters. We are focused on replacing the businesses that have come under increased regulatory scrutiny. When I first shared the regulatory challenges with you in our Q1 call, I told you that I probably would anniversary of the issue by next March, which is when the regulatory impact first hit us. However, over the course of the summer, several additional products came under regulatory scrutiny. As a result, we continue to withdraw from key product lines in our health and exercise categories over the course of Q2 and Q3. We believe that as of the end of October, we have addressed all known regulatory issues. Although, we can't rule out the possibility of further impacts down the road, but we don't think they are likely.  As a result of these actions, we did see continued sales erosion in both Q2 and in Q3, and again, we won't fully anniversary the impact of having pulled out these products, until Q4 of '08. So, we do need to get past October to be completely anniversaried of all these known impacts. Now having said that, I am actually encouraged by Japan. We are making more progress than we anticipated, growing our apparel, accessories, and jewelry lines at accelerated rates to compensate for the significant reduction in the help and exercise business. So, those businesses are growing faster. On the flip side, the regulatory challenges were even greater than we anticipated when we last talked. So, while we are not seeing it on the top-line yet, we believe this business is fundamentally healthy and will show strong results once we anniversary these regulatory issues.  Finally, as Chris mentioned, the UK was a bright spot in the quarter with solid revenue growth and very strong EBITDA results. Looking forward, we will remain focused on the core initiatives we have been discussing over the last year. For example, we will continue to add top-tier destination brands and innovative key items into our assortments. Our recent launches of Samsung, Garmin, Acer, Sharp, Oplus blackened in the US home category, as one example, have exceeded our expectations. As you know, we launched the new QVC logo and branding in late September to very good reviews and positive customer feedback. We believe this is a strong step forward in updating our image and broadening our appeal and we'll provide important benefits over the long-term. We have been migrating our customers to the new QVC.com site over the course of October. We now have all customers on the new QVC.com and while there is always some short-term negative impact when you convert customers from a site that they new well to a new site, we are very excited about the new QVC.com. We think it provides a strong foundation for future growth and we will be launching many new features early next year, and including more integrated video applications to continue to bring the value of our video skills to the internet. Finally, we also announced this morning that we will be simulcasting our US program in high definition by Q2 of next year, and we are currently talking with all of our major distribution partners about carrying a second QVC channel in the HD tier. Now, we believe this will broaden the range of customers we reach. And with that, I'll hand it back to Chris. Chris Shean Thanks Mike. Let's take a quick look at the LINTA liquidity picture. We continue to maintain a strong capital structure with good liquidity the business has attributed to Liberty Interactive. Has attributed cash and public investments of $5.2 billion and has $7.1 billion in attributed debt. The increase in the debt balance during the quarter was primarily the result of ongoing Liberty Interactive share repurchases during the quarter. Excluding the value of the investment positions in Expedia and IAC, Liberty Interactive's quarter ending attributed net debt of just under $6.4 billion equates to a multiple of approximately 3.7 times annual operating cash flow. As previously stated, we will be comfortable sustaining net debt levels 4 to 5 times OCF. As a result the Liberty Interactive businesses had significant liquidity to grow organically and through acquisition and to continue to shrink net equity as appropriate. Now lets move on to Liberty Capital businesses. As Greg mentioned earlier late last month we received shareholder approval to -- upon completion of the News Corp exchange to reclassify our Liberty Capital tracking stock in to two separate series of tracking stocks, one called Liberty Entertainment, the other Liberty Capital. We believe this will produce reduced complexity, greater focus of assets, stronger currencies for financial flexibility, an increased concentration of our remaining non-core assets.  Overall during the quarter Liberty Capital reported a 52% revenue gain while OCF increased by robust 438% primarily as a result of some new businesses that we acquired. LCAPA's largest attributed operating assets Starz Entertainment which does not include Starz Media is continuing to strengthen its cash flow. During the quarter its revenue grew more than 11% to 282 million while it experience a 96% OCF growth to $88 million. I'll take about this more shortly. Now let's take a closer look at Liberty Capital events during the second quarter. As I mentioned LCAPA's attributed revenue grew 52% in the quarter while OCF more than a tuple. Revenue growth resulted from strong revenue growth at Starz and the inclusion of Starz Media and the Atlanta Braves partially offset by lower GAAP revenue at true position which has been required to differ revenue recognition until its delivered all the software features required pursuant to one of its major contract.  The sharp increase in OCF is principally driven by strong growth at Starz also and the inclusion again of the Braves offset by a decrease in OCF at true position and operating cash flow deficit at Starz’s Media. As we continued our efforts to complete the News Corp exchange during the quarter, we do not use any of the significant capital resources attributed to Liberty Capital to repurchase its common stock. Since the issuance of the LCAPA attractive stock we have repurchased approximately 8.2% of the LCAPA shares outstanding. We continue to hold large cash reserves attributed to LCAPA and a final issuance of the new tracking stocks will continue to evaluate share repurchases as a means of enhancing shareholder value as our liquidity position warrants. As I mentioned a moment ago, we continue to work on the completion of the News Corp exchange and hope to close that transaction during the fourth quarter. We are also evaluating numerous other transactions and report on those as they arise. Now let’s take a quick look at Starz. Starz continued to experience solid subscriber growth in the first quarter, as Starz average subs increased 7% while Encore's grew 9%. For the quarter, this subscriber growth along with a higher effective rate due to the retroactive recognition of revenue related to the short-term expense of our DirecTV contract combined to drive an 11% overall revenue growth. We had a couple of revenue growth mitigating items during the quarter including changes in the rate at which certain customers are paying under expired contracts that are under negotiation for renewal, and the shift of former Adelphia subscribers to the lower rate Comcast and Time Warner contracts. Starz’s operating expenses declined 7% from the quarter largely as the result of a decline in programming expense and the reversal on the accrual for moving copy right fees. The reduction in programming cost resulted from lower effective rates for the movie shown in the quarter partially offset by increased costs from a higher ratio of first-run movie exhibitions versus library product expenses. Starz's SG&A expense was largely unchanged for the quarter.  Now, we've going to have Bob Clasen to say a few words about Starz Entertainment and Starz Media. Bob Clasen Thanks, Chris. Once again, we are pleased to report that subscriptions to Starz and Encore continue to grow in the fourth quarter, for the third quarter for the fourth quarter in a row reaching 16 million for Stars and seeing Encore past 13 million homes. These gains coupled with higher effective rates and a continued decline in programming costs serve to drive significant operating cash flow gains.  However, we have several expired affiliate agreements, the completion of negotiations of new mutually beneficial carriage agreements that will allow our business to continue to grow, remain a top year jump priority. I am also pleased to report that we are nearing the launch of the first original series ever shown on the Starz channels. These two half hour comedies at Kayson Hollywood residential will begin airing in January, so be sure to tune in.  Starz Media revenue increased again this quarter versus the same quarter a year ago. The company has began production on eight live action made for TV movies and four television series for first-run on basic cable programming networks and it continues to do animation works for the Simpson's and King of the Hill.  During the quarter, our Toronto Animation Studio began work for hire on two major CG theatrical films after completing the VeggieTales pirate movie that Universal will release in the first quarter of 2008.  Our Overture Films unit continues to add to its slate with the acquisition of the Visitor, winner at the Rome Film Festival and announced that it's first film Mad Money staring Queen Latifa, Katie Holmes and Diane Keaton, will premiere in theatres nationwide on January 18th. I'd be remiss not to make a quick statement on the writers strike. As most of you know the Writers Guild of America initiated a work stoppage this past weekend. Our current movies and series are fully scripted and either in production or set for production, so for the near-term its business as usual at Starz. Should the work stoppage be protracted, we will make adjustments as necessary, but the impact, certainly on the fourth quarter appears to be minimal. Now, I'll turn it back over to Chris. Chris Shean Thanks Bob. Taking a quick look at Liberty Capital's liquidity situation. The LCAPA business has remained in a position of financial strength. At quarter end, and including our News Corp. stake, LCAPA was attributed with approximately $16.9 billion of public investments and derivatives. This is largely unchanged from the second quarter. In addition to our public holding, Liberty Capital has attributed cash and liquid investments of just over $2.7 billion at quarter end. Total cash and public holdings approximate $19.6 billion and are only partially offset by $5.3 billion base amount of attributed debt. This provides Liberty Capital with significant flexibility to grow its businesses and will play an important role in the strategic direction of these assets going forward. Now, with all that said I'll turn the call back over to Greg, who's going to quickly recap the third quarter and talk about what's ahead for us in the remainder of the year. Greg Maffei So, thanks Chris and thank you, Mike and Bob for the updates on your businesses. So, as you can see it was another busy quarter. At Liberty Capital, we had strong operating performance in Starz and most of the other affiliates. We talked about the approval received for the issuance of our new trackers, and we are working to close the news exchange agreement. At Liberty Interactive, we were disappointed with the growth. We believe management has got a firm handle on it and we remain optimistic about the long-term performance of the business. And we were fairly pleased with the performance of other internet affiliates. And as you know, we continue to buyback stock, having brought back almost or more than 14% of the stock since we issued this trackers. Looking ahead, I think as you know we are first going to move to close that news deal. We are going to look to issue those trackers and we are not continuing to think about ways to optimize our non-strategic assets over the Liberty Capital. And put together synergistic operating businesses at Liberty Interactive and Liberty Entertainment. Create as much financial flexibility as possible to think about consolidating various assets, and above all, focus on trying to grow shareholder value. So with that let me turn it over to the operator and open it for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Absolutely. (Operator Instructions). And we'll go first to Robert Peck with Bear Stearns. Robert Peck - Bear Stearns Hi I have two quick questions. The first, Greg, is for you. Could you give us little more color around the IAC spend and what the implications are for Liberty. Are there any sort of tax implication that was going to stop any deal being done for a swap for HSN? And could you also talk about how your voting rights would be applied to be various businesses? Then I have a follow up for Mike. Greg Maffei Thank you Robert. I think to a large degree many of the answer to those questions are all no. I don't believe there are any tax implications from the spin itself. A question of how we redeemed or traded our stock for positions in one or the other of operating businesses including potentially HSN, it could be more attractive. We can't really do that before a spin. You can come up lots of scenarios. But, we know we played our hand and had our dialog with Barry about potential transactions prior to the spin and haven't reached provision. So, we'll continue that dialog heading into the spin and see where we end up. As far as where our super vote goes and where Barry's proxy goes, it's complicated. It's somewhat related to where Barry is still CEO and what we negotiate with him. So, I have to tell you that I think we are going to a negotiation phase, and where we come at the other side, I can't predict which businesses will be ultimately owned, consolidated, held at all by Liberty or frankly by CREs. So, I think the fact that it's happening will create opportunities, but I don't know exactly where they are going to go in from the relationship. Mostly, I think it's going to show and continue to increase the value at IAC and that's a positive for us. John, you want to add anything on that. John Malone No, I think it's terrific for us. Each one of these businesses will now have clear dependant management for the most part and whether we increase, decrease or what relationship Liberty has with each one of these units will be determined, I would guess, over the next six months. But, I think it represents great opportunity for Liberty and frankly for IAC shareholders generally to focus their investment and their interests in the areas that they think closer than the most. It also creates the possibility of capital structures in each one of these businesses to take advantage of their particular cash flow and tax faster.  So, I think it goes a long way towards resolving much long time than the mild disagreement between Mr. Diller and myself about the appropriate use of leverage in each of these businesses. Some of these clearly will have superior economic returns based upon leveraged balance sheet.  Robert Peck - Bear Stearns Okay, great. So just to be clear than post spin with HSM, with any HSM deal therefore then be taxable? Chris Shean Well, I don't think so. Other way to look at it would be to say that there would be more trust issues related to a change in either involving or equity ownership in excess of 50% from the existing shareholder group, since we already have 56% I believe as above.  Mike George Take it now 58 but it is something like that, yes. Chris Shean We can't violate more stress by changing our voting relationship. We might be to some degree limited for some period of time and how much of the equity we could own in a cash transaction, but who knows that it depends on the capital structure with which this business is ultimately expand.  Robert Peck - Bear Stearns Shifting gears for Mike then, Mike in HSN actually had a pretty good quarter up about 5% or so, could you talk a little about the differences that QVC is seeing and do you think you can start from emulating sum of that growth rate you are sensing?  Mike George Compare with HSN I asked, we don't know any more details than you all know in terms of what’s behind that. We also had a very strong record of growth for number of years and we had a very different place in terms of our profitability rate which is roughly four times HSN. So have chosen our path that we think is the most positive for the shareholders which is to maintain our margins and avoid heavy promotional activity is attraction of HSNs and we think that’s best for the long-term. When you are in a period of copy the number of year's of high growth and in a period where there is some skittishness in the economy and in retail spend as we saw with yesterdays announcements. Yes, it will have an impact on us. We haven't been able to rise above it, so we are just going to stay focused on our business. We think there are enormous growth opportunities we have in front of us in terms of product categories and then in terms of great day-to-day executions. So we rip apart the business everyday. We try to find ways to create more exciting experiences for the customer, bring in new brands. We think that's right for the long-term, but when the business is fundamentally healthy we don' think we need to go to the pricing lever, we'd rather just keep working on as a fundamentals of exciting that core customer with great product. And I think we will over the long run we are very comfortable that that will get us to growth that we need. Greg Maffei Yeah. Robert, I'd like to -- this is Greg. I'd like to comment on the some of the premises of the question frankly, because if you are -- and look we are big shareholder and I see I hope they could see it very well but the comparison of somebody who has had very weak comps for long period, invested heavily in a lot of promotional items, in a lot of promotional inventory and then when that bar is lower enough hurdles over it at least only in the revenue line but doesn't reach at anywhere nearly on the profitability or free cash flow line it’s a little bit of an unfair comparison to say wow homerun. So I think we would be very happy and are very happy with the relative long-term performance and continued cash flow generation capabilities at Q relative to H. Robert Peck - Bear Stearns Thanks everybody. Operator And we'll go to Imran Khan with JP Morgan. Bridget Wyshar - JP Morgan Hi this is Bridget Wyshar in for Imran. Quick question about domestic QVC, given that weaken retail environment and your non-promotional stands have you seen any changes in your inventory levels there? Greg Maffei Yeah, Bridget I think we have been actually very pleased with our ability to manage our inventories. We are always challenging when the sales come in below your expectations but we have been able to keep inventory on plan and for the most part we feel very comfortable with [Technical Difficulty] inventories. Bridget Wyshar - JP Morgan Great. And then a question on Japan. Can you give us any insight into how much of the business is now under regulatory environment in terms of product percentage? Greg Maffei Yeah. Clearly the biggest impact is in the health category. Health category we will give feel for that. If you look at that combined, the combined health category fell from about 21% of our business a year ago to a little less than 9% this year. So what was, you know, not quite a quarter of the business that is reduced to less than half of its current size. There are some impacts in a few of the home categories, primarily in the exercise fitness area. And so that's having an impact, but it's a smaller impact. Again, as I mentioned earlier, what's encouraging to us is we had 20%, 30%, 40% kinds of growth rates in apparel, accessories and jewelry, although it's a more airtime. So we feel good that those businesses are growing, but we've got about a quarter of the business that really is in a very challenged state. Bridget Wyshar - JP Morgan Great. Thanks a lot.  Operator And we'll next go to Jessica Cohen of Merrill Lynch Jessica Cohen - Merrill Lynch Thanks and also QVC related question. I was just wondering back to HSN, if you could be more specific on the pros and cons of combining with HSN from both a revenue and a cost perspective, because we've heard previous QVC management have -- we've heard many views expressed on that? And then, also could you comment on how much jewelry is of the business right now and the impact with gold prices increasing? John Malone Sure. On jewelry, of course, the jewelry is about a quarter of our business in the US. As we've mentioned on prior calls, the gold component of that business has continued to struggle. And unfortunately, we thought we might see some stabilization, but obviously, gold has reaccelerated and we don't see any end in sight. So our gold business is in negative territory, and gold is roughly a quarter to a third of the total jewelry business. There are other parts of jewelry that are doing reasonably well, gemstone business is particular strong. So, while gold is a bit of an anchor in the business, the rate of decline has probably slowed and there are other things working in jewelry, so that we think over the long-term we can manage around that issue. On HSN, I guess I'll make a couple of comments, and then Greg wants to add to it. What we've said in the past on HSN is, at the right value, we certainly think there is some benefit to ownership of the two companies, but we don't think the hard synergies are significant. By hard synergies I mean clear cost takeout. So you'd have to run to largely independent businesses and the real costs are around the product and the operation of the channel. So I think you'd see fairly modest hard synergies and wildcard or kind of the softer benefits of being able to perhaps counter program the two channels, leverage, share vendors in the right way, or other approaches to sort of present a more unified phase to the customer. But those are fairly untested. So you certainly wouldn't want to pay a premium to get those benefits. So at some costs, we think there is value in HSN. But the hard synergies are just not that significant. Greg Maffei Next question? Operator And our next question will come from Jason Bazinet with Citigroup. Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Thanks. Two quick questions. Can you just go back to the stated objectives with the new trackers of Liberty Capital? I'm still sort of hung up on this 551 exchangeable over at Liberty Entertainment, because it seems like there is a risk that it reduces the amount of Holco discount that will be reduced by sort of muddying up the story a bit. And so my question is, is that designed to give you the flexibility to convert to an asset-backed security at some point in the future? In other words, is that why you put that there at all? And then my second question on Q and H, do you think there is an opportunity to sort of -- if you get control of the asset to go after a very different demographic at H as opposed to sort of going after the same demo, which I think you are broadly today? Thanks. Greg Maffei Well, Jason, I'll kind of the first one, and then let Mike handle the second. Obviously, we hope not to muddy the water, and given the amount of cash that we sent over with the exchangeable, I don't think that is an issue. There were some, I would say, relatively tax motivated reasons we thought that it would be better to leave the exchangeable within or rather put it in the new tracker. I would actually say it's probably the reverse of what you're suggesting in terms of a hard spin, because while one doesn't know exactly how our hard spin would work if one did a hard spin, that 551 via comp exchangeable is an obligation of the parent, which really is old Liberty Capital and would likely either need to be transferred or attributed back or paid off depending on whatever set of circumstances you can imagine. So Liberty Entertainment is unlikely, if it ever were hard spun, ever end up with that debt per se. Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Okay. Greg Maffei So I don't think that's the motivation. Hopefully, we'll be able to walk through and explain in clarity what the balance sheet of Liberty Entertainment, which is very underleveraged, theoretically, it looks like, given its got net cash of about almost $600 million, $550 million, hopefully, we would be able to walk through and explain that. Mike, you want to address the second? Mike George Sure. That is a kind of a general statement. We've found that it's hard to be too targeted or too narrow in the demographic reach that we go after and get the kind of revenue level that you need to support a national channel. Our approach has always been to try to appeal to the broadest range of demographics that we can. And we do find even with in Q that the demographics for Bare Essentials beauty hour is wildly different as you might expect than a NASCAR hour to pick two extremes. So, typically the way our business works, and I suspect H is the same way, it needed diversity of programming that appeals to a broad range of demographics. And then the demographics vary a lot throughout the course of the day or week or month. That said, there is some opportunity to more sharply differentiate the two formats on some dimensions. There might be, I can't honestly say that I have studied it carefully to give you a really thoughtful response. So, there certainly maybe some targeting opportunity. But as a general statement, you typically need to reach for fairly broad audience to drive the kind of revenue we need to make the format work. Jason Bazinet - Citigroup That's great. Thank you very much. Operator And we will go to Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley Hey, guys, its Ben Swinburne. How are you? Chris Shean  Hi, Ben. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley Hey. Couple of questions. Greg, you made a comment upfront. I just wanted a get a clarification on the LCAPA, you didn't buyback stock in LCAPA during the quarter. Was that due to a restriction? Or just by choice? And then on the QVC business, Mike you talked about at the Analyst day or Investor Day about new markets. Any change or update there based on the performances in Germany and Japan on sort of where you are focused and what the timing might be? And then maybe lastly for John and Greg, you guys could give us your completely unbiased view of the cable and satellite results this quarter, I would appreciate it. Greg Maffei Why don't we do the Q first, then I will go right into the LCAPA and SAT versus cable. Do you want to talk about Q international markets Mike? Mike George Thanks Ben. No new news on international expansion. As we did talked at Investors Day we remain interested and are in active, I would characterize it as active discussions with potential partners in a few different markets. And as I mentioned, there is nothing imminent on the horizon. And to the point you called out, Ben, we would be cautious about taking on another market until we are confident that not only do we have the right opportunity, but we have the management depth to take it on. Clearly, David Fry and our international leadership team are very focused on addressing the issues in Germany and Japan. We want that to be there overwhelming focus and we don't want to create a lot of distraction by trying to start another market. But having said that, we are in active discussions, and if the right opportunity presented itself to us and we were confident that was a good long-term opportunity, we would go after it. But, we will do it in a measured way and make sure that it doesn't distract from driving the kind of results we need to see in the three existing markets. Greg Maffei So, Ben, on the stock question. I don't think we call out what did or didn't usually did it, or drove rather our purchase or lack of purchase decisions. I think we've been relatively consistent in saying Liberty Interactive has an enormous free cash flow generating assets in QVC. So, one would expect, all things being equal, systematic shrink is the most logical way for us to do that. To the degree we don't have opportunity that we see to add synergistic e-commerce and brand assets and brand businesses, which we've done some of, but typically we can't consume all that free cash flow. It's likely that we will continue to repurchase stock, and given especially, under leveraged really above, the fact that we are sub 4 and we believe four to five is achievable on a net debt basis and manageable. It's likely we'll continue to shrink systematically to get to that target and take advantage of that free cash flow.  Alright. Now at LCAPA we have done one big shrink in the form of a self tender, but our progress there has been what we call episodic. Meaning, if there is a transaction which generates capital and frankly in 2006 and in 2007 we had several of those including, the Time Warner exchange, the sale On Command, the sale of Court, we'll consider cash flow utilized or utilized in a cash rather from those transactions then repurchasing stocks, but there is no sort of episodic or rather there is no continuing shrink there. And frankly, there was nothing in the quarter that we did which generated significant cash at Liberty Capital. There was the free cash flow generation at Starz, but it is relative to the scale of what Q does and relative to the scale of Liberty Capital it's not the same. So, that's where the logic and mentality of it. And frankly, until we know where we end post the subsequent trackers or new trackers, we are going to probably watch and see how those trade and we are going to watch and see the free cash flow generation capability that Direct has what our access to that capital is and how we utilize that probably before we make any dramatic moves. As far as the progress of satellite versus cable, I think we are very gratified on several levels. We believed when we were looking at becoming shareholders in DirecTV that the market probably had overreacted to the power of the bundle that mentioned what clearly bundle has positives but much of what it could do and how it would hurt DirecTV, with already being absorbed and DirecTV had ways to go directly to customers and create bundles with telcos that will provide an effective means to get into customers.  And offsetting that we saw and we endorsed what management was doing with it's focus on HD. It's focused on going for the best customers in the marketplace for video or in the DVR segment as well. And it's focused on the TV experience and content. And I think we are gratified that they have executed very well in that plan. They continue to show upside and they appeared to have run rooms, satellite appears to have run room in the marketplace. We believe that competing on that differentiated experience; better video, more choice in video, more choice in content, a great TV experience. All of those are very attractive and they're going to give us some run room here. Will it be forever? Who knows, but I think satellite has got several more quarters of good growth relative to the cable choices and we are gratified that it's working that way. John do you want to ad anything? John Malone Yeah. I mean, just looking at quarterly results, the cable guys are still eating into the telcos and data telephony. The video side seems to be favoring satellite at the moment. I think primarily driven by more choice in high definition which is clearly an edge at the moment in virtually all markets, so DirecTV over any of its competitors and I think also Direct has done an excellent job of differentiating itself in the sports. So now if they have high-def sports but have -- they can -- its actually the high end, it's at the high road in differentiated sports, so whether its investment in Sunday ticket or what they do on NASCAR in terms of multiple channels, when the races are on. They have done an excellent job of exploiting differentiated content, Hi-Fi definition that’s given the public rather accelerating take up of high definition now on a larger screen its pretty clear. I use the analogy the other way, I have got a treadmill and my wife brought me a large screen TV that's three feet away from the treadmill and DirecTV which we have at home is currently offering most of their high-def channels back-to-back with their standard definition channels, so you can by clicking back and forward you can see the football game in high-def from standard def and its dramatic to the point where, if I could only watch at standard def I probably would be very unhappy and thus seek an alternate supplier. And I think that that is starting to impact the high end of the marketplace in favor of DirecTV and as Greg says, it's hard to project how long it will take cable to be able to come up with something equivalent.  But I don't believe that switch digital which is essentially the technological solutions that the cable industry is hanging their hat on will be adequate to close the gap and certainly not adequate on ubiquitous spaces. So that these opportunities to differentiate on high def wire power will persist for an extended period of time and at least part of the country and it's satellite will be able to exploit that and simply DirecTV.  So obviously, we are thrilled with current results and we think that they press which is pretty strong potential in the exploitation of video. I wouldn’t try for the cable, I mean they are doing extremely well, with higher margin of products that they are eating into the telcos. Greg Maffei And going forward, I guess going back, we had a period where we see cable had a big advantage because of bundle and they do. They, as John notes are generating lots of RGUs even at a perhaps with slow rate versus telcos, but they generate a lot of RGUs and taking telco share. During that time people were quite negative about DirecTV, many people and we saw and frankly followed what the management team there did. We are not going to claim credit, but we saw they were doing endorsers of it in terms of their bet on the video capabilities and the video experience, and we see that paying off. As John notes, how long that will go on, this is the constant game of innovation, and the key is to find niches where you can be the leader and be providing a differentiated experience. And we think Direct's got lots of room to do that. For now in HD, and I think down the road, in content and the TV experience, what they have planned could be very interesting and very powerful. The last thing I'd note is the opportunity created by having a national business, the one offset that we appreciate. And I think if the Direct team, it's management team is smarter, we can help is way to think about exploring the fact that we have national business. The guys who are hurrying the most are the ones who ended buyer from the strongest telco product and where the telcos have been strong, and obviously, particularly where they have files, that is a tough product to compete against, particularly given the amount of marketing and dollars that is being invested by the telcos. And we're lucky to have a balanced business that can absorb, a), one of the areas where we were strongest, DirecTV; b) we have an ability to grow another market. John Malone I think I would add to what Greg is saying about ubiquity. When you have a national business, your services are ubiquitously available. It gives you enormous opportunities in content that frankly TCI and cable never had because of the vulcanization of the cable footprint. So that is a very important ingredient long-term that favors the satellite footprint over the cable footprint; i.e. the ability to make a decision on content and have that content available ubiquitously across the whole country. A cable operator, even one as big as Brian, I think you know, is still limited to a footprint that may be 35% of the country. And then, only if all of these facilities are equally capable of adding an incremental service as DirecTV, if they have room to add an incremental service, it automatically is incrementally available on a national scale. This is a huge advantage for satellite over cable. And really when I've been on the other side of the equation, I used to worry about that a great deal. Greg Maffei Cable has lots of advantages by being regional, and they are doing quite well. And the best case for everybody would probably be if people gravitate towards their respective strengths and to some degree that's happening. We'll see how it plays. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley Thanks, guys. Operator And we will move next to Jeff Shelton with Natexis. Jeff Shelton - Natexis Thanks. Just one quick IAC follow-up question. At this point do you guys have any hard blocking rights over the ultimate IAC spin-off structure? Greg Maffei That's a legal question. Chris Shean Yeah. I think we would argue that there are restrictions on what IAC can do and not do, but we'll have some of that dialogue with IAC. Greg Maffei But as announced, the answer is yes. Jeff Shelton - Natexis Does there need to be another Board vote or not? Greg Maffei Yeah. There will have to be many Board deliberations at IAC before the actual spin-off can be implemented, and it will have to be a resolution of these open issues relative to the relationship between Barry and Liberty. Jeff Shelton - Natexis Thank you. Chris Shean Maybe two more questions. Operator Okay. We'll go to April Horace with Janco Partner. April Horace - Janco Partner Hi. Thanks. Quick question on QVC. I was wondering are you guys exploring, moving to more of an interactive platform, similar to what HSN did with Dish, and do you think that would add incrementally to the revenue streams? Mike George April, we do explore it. We had tested interactive applications a few years ago, and didn't see a lot of benefit at that time. As you may know, we have an interactive application in the UK, which we've had for over five years. So we can't pioneer that concept in our UK business. And so I think we know a fair amount about it from our learning's in the UK. At a high level, we don't see it being much of a revenue driver. And certainly, our five years of experience in the UK as well as our testing that we did in the US, in neither of those experiences do we feel that it materially added to revenue. But it can save some expenses, depending on whether people use that application versus a live operator or an automated voice response unit or the internet. So depending on what ordering mechanism it substitutes for, there can be a modest cost saving. So we remain interested in it, and as the technologies mature and as it becomes an easier experience for customers, I think it's probably likely that we will adopt interactive application. For us, the upside is to look down the road and to see whether beyond just simplifying new ordering mechanism, there are really value-added applications that create a superior experience for the customer, and I don't think that technology is quite there yet. But it will probably come. We're going to be testing a number of really interesting applications in our UK business next year on this platform. That will basically give the customer a choice of watching the live show, or watching a video-on-demand channel, or watching shows that had aired earlier in the day, so that it gives the customer more choice and control over what she is watching on TV. So, obviously that platform is different in the UK than what we have in the US market. So, long we are saying, we think it's interesting, we know quite a bit about it. At the right time in the US we'll probably do something. Do we see it as being a significant revenue adder? Maybe in the long-term if some of these value-added applications are merged. So, not yet, but potentially down the road. John Malone I think one of the most interesting potential applications, as you know DVRs are exploding in terms of take up rate. The ability to push video into the DVR and make it randomly accessible by the consumer could well be the application that ultimately benefits QVC in terms of broadening its audience and giving better access to selected products or something of that nature. So, I have longed been proponent of interactive television. If the opportunities are still there the technology has not quite matured on the video side, the way it has on the Internet side, when it finally does, I think the ability to sell products to mass audiences on an impulse basis will turn out to be huge. The only place that we've ever seen it demonstrated are what you call per inquiry type adds, which is actually a pretty big industry by the way of somewhat [sloppy] products and still generating some huge amount of revenue both for network owners, as well as for proprietors. And that's sort of a demonstration of the fire power if you can put an offer in front of the large audience. And the opportunity to do that which may not be QVC's specific as much as it is a benefit say to do DirecTV eventually or anybody who can network and preload make video-on-demand a reality on a real-time basis and then cross promote it. I think it still remains unexploited, but very large opportunity.  Chris Shean Great. Last question please. Operator And your last question will come from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Yes, good morning. I wanted to know, if you could talk a little bit more about Starz Media. How big the feature film slate is going to be, the impact on OpEx and synergies other parts of Liberty?  Chris Shean Hey, Bob do you want to comment?  Bob Clasen Sure. Overture Films is looking at 40 titles, a whole slate of films over the next five years, so eight to 10 each year. They've already announced the first eight films and we would expect that there will be about seven or eight released in 2008. And again, these films are typically in a negative cost range anywhere from $5 million to north of $50 million. Although, our focus is acquiring only US rights. And so as we've reported we are looking to have an average acquisition price or production price of only about $15 million. We are actually thrilled with their initial slate that includes Righteous Kill with Al Pacino and DeNiro, very highly anticipated, and just wrapped. We are just finishing an Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman film in London, and of course, the Mad Money story is almost everywhere from People Magazine to Oprah. So, there is an awful lot of excitement about that that will be released in January. Our view of this, of course, as we have said before, is that Starz Entertainment acquires about a 110 new output titles each year to fuel our viewer ship on the Starz channels. And that buying eight or 10 of those a year from ourselves and our affiliate companies seem to make a lot of sense, and we think there are other synergies to our home entertainment business through Anchor Bay, that will distributing these domestically as they come to that market, also digitally. We have a company now that division within Starz Media that sells to everyone from Netflix to AOL to Amazon and we will be very active, moving product to the new digital technology, so they become available. So, we think it works very well on an integrated basis, and will give us very high quality films to anchor our entertainment channels. And then of course go into our library after they have gone through their broadcast window and so on and they will be available for us over the next 10, 15, 20 years. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Do your current suppliers feel any kind of competitive pressure from you at all? Bob Clasen Well, that's a great question. I remember for the first time meeting, with Universal a few years ago, and they actually took the other position at Universal and I think that Sony. We think differently, if you also produce product as opposed to just being a passive distributor, and our relationships, I think, with most of our major studio partners, and the Disney lawsuit aside, are very positive and there are a number of studios who are concerned, obviously, about status of their pay TV deals. And we have become over the last few year the largest acquirer of independent films because of all the channels we have to fill for the premium space and are looking to actually acquire even more rights for those for your home video and even for domestic television which will give us another spin anchored by our ability to put them on a pay television service. And I think that we are exploring with the number of the other studios, things that we might do together on a production basis that would give them some access to Starz pay business but also give us an opportunity to leverage their tremendous production capacity and creative environments. So, I think the synergies are kind of popping out all over the place frankly. Mike George Well I think Overture and Starz Media open up a whole bunch of options. Bob has noted that I think we are just beginning to explore hopefully over the next couple of years we really be able to take advantage of. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Hey. Great thank you. Greg Maffei Thank you, operator and everybody who listened in and asked questions and we look forward to talking to you at the end of Q4, if not before.

And we'll go first to Robert Peck with Bear Stearns. Robert Peck - Bear Stearns Hi I have two quick questions. The first, Greg, is for you. Could you give us little more color around the IAC spend and what the implications are for Liberty. Are there any sort of tax implication that was going to stop any deal being done for a swap for HSN? And could you also talk about how your voting rights would be applied to be various businesses? Then I have a follow up for Mike. Greg Maffei Thank you Robert. I think to a large degree many of the answer to those questions are all no. I don't believe there are any tax implications from the spin itself. A question of how we redeemed or traded our stock for positions in one or the other of operating businesses including potentially HSN, it could be more attractive. We can't really do that before a spin. You can come up lots of scenarios. But, we know we played our hand and had our dialog with Barry about potential transactions prior to the spin and haven't reached provision. So, we'll continue that dialog heading into the spin and see where we end up. As far as where our super vote goes and where Barry's proxy goes, it's complicated. It's somewhat related to where Barry is still CEO and what we negotiate with him. So, I have to tell you that I think we are going to a negotiation phase, and where we come at the other side, I can't predict which businesses will be ultimately owned, consolidated, held at all by Liberty or frankly by CREs. So, I think the fact that it's happening will create opportunities, but I don't know exactly where they are going to go in from the relationship. Mostly, I think it's going to show and continue to increase the value at IAC and that's a positive for us. John, you want to add anything on that. John Malone No, I think it's terrific for us. Each one of these businesses will now have clear dependant management for the most part and whether we increase, decrease or what relationship Liberty has with each one of these units will be determined, I would guess, over the next six months. But, I think it represents great opportunity for Liberty and frankly for IAC shareholders generally to focus their investment and their interests in the areas that they think closer than the most. It also creates the possibility of capital structures in each one of these businesses to take advantage of their particular cash flow and tax faster.  So, I think it goes a long way towards resolving much long time than the mild disagreement between Mr. Diller and myself about the appropriate use of leverage in each of these businesses. Some of these clearly will have superior economic returns based upon leveraged balance sheet.  Robert Peck - Bear Stearns Okay, great. So just to be clear than post spin with HSM, with any HSM deal therefore then be taxable? Chris Shean Well, I don't think so. Other way to look at it would be to say that there would be more trust issues related to a change in either involving or equity ownership in excess of 50% from the existing shareholder group, since we already have 56% I believe as above.  Mike George Take it now 58 but it is something like that, yes. Chris Shean We can't violate more stress by changing our voting relationship. We might be to some degree limited for some period of time and how much of the equity we could own in a cash transaction, but who knows that it depends on the capital structure with which this business is ultimately expand.  Robert Peck - Bear Stearns Shifting gears for Mike then, Mike in HSN actually had a pretty good quarter up about 5% or so, could you talk a little about the differences that QVC is seeing and do you think you can start from emulating sum of that growth rate you are sensing?  Mike George Compare with HSN I asked, we don't know any more details than you all know in terms of what’s behind that. We also had a very strong record of growth for number of years and we had a very different place in terms of our profitability rate which is roughly four times HSN. So have chosen our path that we think is the most positive for the shareholders which is to maintain our margins and avoid heavy promotional activity is attraction of HSNs and we think that’s best for the long-term. When you are in a period of copy the number of year's of high growth and in a period where there is some skittishness in the economy and in retail spend as we saw with yesterdays announcements. Yes, it will have an impact on us. We haven't been able to rise above it, so we are just going to stay focused on our business. We think there are enormous growth opportunities we have in front of us in terms of product categories and then in terms of great day-to-day executions. So we rip apart the business everyday. We try to find ways to create more exciting experiences for the customer, bring in new brands. We think that's right for the long-term, but when the business is fundamentally healthy we don' think we need to go to the pricing lever, we'd rather just keep working on as a fundamentals of exciting that core customer with great product. And I think we will over the long run we are very comfortable that that will get us to growth that we need. Greg Maffei Yeah. Robert, I'd like to -- this is Greg. I'd like to comment on the some of the premises of the question frankly, because if you are -- and look we are big shareholder and I see I hope they could see it very well but the comparison of somebody who has had very weak comps for long period, invested heavily in a lot of promotional items, in a lot of promotional inventory and then when that bar is lower enough hurdles over it at least only in the revenue line but doesn't reach at anywhere nearly on the profitability or free cash flow line it’s a little bit of an unfair comparison to say wow homerun. So I think we would be very happy and are very happy with the relative long-term performance and continued cash flow generation capabilities at Q relative to H. Robert Peck - Bear Stearns Thanks everybody. Operator And we'll go to Imran Khan with JP Morgan. Bridget Wyshar - JP Morgan Hi this is Bridget Wyshar in for Imran. Quick question about domestic QVC, given that weaken retail environment and your non-promotional stands have you seen any changes in your inventory levels there? Greg Maffei Yeah, Bridget I think we have been actually very pleased with our ability to manage our inventories. We are always challenging when the sales come in below your expectations but we have been able to keep inventory on plan and for the most part we feel very comfortable with [Technical Difficulty] inventories. Bridget Wyshar - JP Morgan Great. And then a question on Japan. Can you give us any insight into how much of the business is now under regulatory environment in terms of product percentage? Greg Maffei Yeah. Clearly the biggest impact is in the health category. Health category we will give feel for that. If you look at that combined, the combined health category fell from about 21% of our business a year ago to a little less than 9% this year. So what was, you know, not quite a quarter of the business that is reduced to less than half of its current size. There are some impacts in a few of the home categories, primarily in the exercise fitness area. And so that's having an impact, but it's a smaller impact. Again, as I mentioned earlier, what's encouraging to us is we had 20%, 30%, 40% kinds of growth rates in apparel, accessories and jewelry, although it's a more airtime. So we feel good that those businesses are growing, but we've got about a quarter of the business that really is in a very challenged state. Bridget Wyshar - JP Morgan Great. Thanks a lot.  Operator And we'll next go to Jessica Cohen of Merrill Lynch Jessica Cohen - Merrill Lynch Thanks and also QVC related question. I was just wondering back to HSN, if you could be more specific on the pros and cons of combining with HSN from both a revenue and a cost perspective, because we've heard previous QVC management have -- we've heard many views expressed on that? And then, also could you comment on how much jewelry is of the business right now and the impact with gold prices increasing? John Malone Sure. On jewelry, of course, the jewelry is about a quarter of our business in the US. As we've mentioned on prior calls, the gold component of that business has continued to struggle. And unfortunately, we thought we might see some stabilization, but obviously, gold has reaccelerated and we don't see any end in sight. So our gold business is in negative territory, and gold is roughly a quarter to a third of the total jewelry business. There are other parts of jewelry that are doing reasonably well, gemstone business is particular strong. So, while gold is a bit of an anchor in the business, the rate of decline has probably slowed and there are other things working in jewelry, so that we think over the long-term we can manage around that issue. On HSN, I guess I'll make a couple of comments, and then Greg wants to add to it. What we've said in the past on HSN is, at the right value, we certainly think there is some benefit to ownership of the two companies, but we don't think the hard synergies are significant. By hard synergies I mean clear cost takeout. So you'd have to run to largely independent businesses and the real costs are around the product and the operation of the channel. So I think you'd see fairly modest hard synergies and wildcard or kind of the softer benefits of being able to perhaps counter program the two channels, leverage, share vendors in the right way, or other approaches to sort of present a more unified phase to the customer. But those are fairly untested. So you certainly wouldn't want to pay a premium to get those benefits. So at some costs, we think there is value in HSN. But the hard synergies are just not that significant. Greg Maffei Next question? Operator And our next question will come from Jason Bazinet with Citigroup. Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Thanks. Two quick questions. Can you just go back to the stated objectives with the new trackers of Liberty Capital? I'm still sort of hung up on this 551 exchangeable over at Liberty Entertainment, because it seems like there is a risk that it reduces the amount of Holco discount that will be reduced by sort of muddying up the story a bit. And so my question is, is that designed to give you the flexibility to convert to an asset-backed security at some point in the future? In other words, is that why you put that there at all? And then my second question on Q and H, do you think there is an opportunity to sort of -- if you get control of the asset to go after a very different demographic at H as opposed to sort of going after the same demo, which I think you are broadly today? Thanks. Greg Maffei Well, Jason, I'll kind of the first one, and then let Mike handle the second. Obviously, we hope not to muddy the water, and given the amount of cash that we sent over with the exchangeable, I don't think that is an issue. There were some, I would say, relatively tax motivated reasons we thought that it would be better to leave the exchangeable within or rather put it in the new tracker. I would actually say it's probably the reverse of what you're suggesting in terms of a hard spin, because while one doesn't know exactly how our hard spin would work if one did a hard spin, that 551 via comp exchangeable is an obligation of the parent, which really is old Liberty Capital and would likely either need to be transferred or attributed back or paid off depending on whatever set of circumstances you can imagine. So Liberty Entertainment is unlikely, if it ever were hard spun, ever end up with that debt per se. Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Okay. Greg Maffei So I don't think that's the motivation. Hopefully, we'll be able to walk through and explain in clarity what the balance sheet of Liberty Entertainment, which is very underleveraged, theoretically, it looks like, given its got net cash of about almost $600 million, $550 million, hopefully, we would be able to walk through and explain that. Mike, you want to address the second? Mike George Sure. That is a kind of a general statement. We've found that it's hard to be too targeted or too narrow in the demographic reach that we go after and get the kind of revenue level that you need to support a national channel. Our approach has always been to try to appeal to the broadest range of demographics that we can. And we do find even with in Q that the demographics for Bare Essentials beauty hour is wildly different as you might expect than a NASCAR hour to pick two extremes. So, typically the way our business works, and I suspect H is the same way, it needed diversity of programming that appeals to a broad range of demographics. And then the demographics vary a lot throughout the course of the day or week or month. That said, there is some opportunity to more sharply differentiate the two formats on some dimensions. There might be, I can't honestly say that I have studied it carefully to give you a really thoughtful response. So, there certainly maybe some targeting opportunity. But as a general statement, you typically need to reach for fairly broad audience to drive the kind of revenue we need to make the format work. Jason Bazinet - Citigroup That's great. Thank you very much. Operator And we will go to Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley Hey, guys, its Ben Swinburne. How are you? Chris Shean  Hi, Ben. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley Hey. Couple of questions. Greg, you made a comment upfront. I just wanted a get a clarification on the LCAPA, you didn't buyback stock in LCAPA during the quarter. Was that due to a restriction? Or just by choice? And then on the QVC business, Mike you talked about at the Analyst day or Investor Day about new markets. Any change or update there based on the performances in Germany and Japan on sort of where you are focused and what the timing might be? And then maybe lastly for John and Greg, you guys could give us your completely unbiased view of the cable and satellite results this quarter, I would appreciate it. Greg Maffei Why don't we do the Q first, then I will go right into the LCAPA and SAT versus cable. Do you want to talk about Q international markets Mike? Mike George Thanks Ben. No new news on international expansion. As we did talked at Investors Day we remain interested and are in active, I would characterize it as active discussions with potential partners in a few different markets. And as I mentioned, there is nothing imminent on the horizon. And to the point you called out, Ben, we would be cautious about taking on another market until we are confident that not only do we have the right opportunity, but we have the management depth to take it on. Clearly, David Fry and our international leadership team are very focused on addressing the issues in Germany and Japan. We want that to be there overwhelming focus and we don't want to create a lot of distraction by trying to start another market. But having said that, we are in active discussions, and if the right opportunity presented itself to us and we were confident that was a good long-term opportunity, we would go after it. But, we will do it in a measured way and make sure that it doesn't distract from driving the kind of results we need to see in the three existing markets. Greg Maffei So, Ben, on the stock question. I don't think we call out what did or didn't usually did it, or drove rather our purchase or lack of purchase decisions. I think we've been relatively consistent in saying Liberty Interactive has an enormous free cash flow generating assets in QVC. So, one would expect, all things being equal, systematic shrink is the most logical way for us to do that. To the degree we don't have opportunity that we see to add synergistic e-commerce and brand assets and brand businesses, which we've done some of, but typically we can't consume all that free cash flow. It's likely that we will continue to repurchase stock, and given especially, under leveraged really above, the fact that we are sub 4 and we believe four to five is achievable on a net debt basis and manageable. It's likely we'll continue to shrink systematically to get to that target and take advantage of that free cash flow.  Alright. Now at LCAPA we have done one big shrink in the form of a self tender, but our progress there has been what we call episodic. Meaning, if there is a transaction which generates capital and frankly in 2006 and in 2007 we had several of those including, the Time Warner exchange, the sale On Command, the sale of Court, we'll consider cash flow utilized or utilized in a cash rather from those transactions then repurchasing stocks, but there is no sort of episodic or rather there is no continuing shrink there. And frankly, there was nothing in the quarter that we did which generated significant cash at Liberty Capital. There was the free cash flow generation at Starz, but it is relative to the scale of what Q does and relative to the scale of Liberty Capital it's not the same. So, that's where the logic and mentality of it. And frankly, until we know where we end post the subsequent trackers or new trackers, we are going to probably watch and see how those trade and we are going to watch and see the free cash flow generation capability that Direct has what our access to that capital is and how we utilize that probably before we make any dramatic moves. As far as the progress of satellite versus cable, I think we are very gratified on several levels. We believed when we were looking at becoming shareholders in DirecTV that the market probably had overreacted to the power of the bundle that mentioned what clearly bundle has positives but much of what it could do and how it would hurt DirecTV, with already being absorbed and DirecTV had ways to go directly to customers and create bundles with telcos that will provide an effective means to get into customers.  And offsetting that we saw and we endorsed what management was doing with it's focus on HD. It's focused on going for the best customers in the marketplace for video or in the DVR segment as well. And it's focused on the TV experience and content. And I think we are gratified that they have executed very well in that plan. They continue to show upside and they appeared to have run rooms, satellite appears to have run room in the marketplace. We believe that competing on that differentiated experience; better video, more choice in video, more choice in content, a great TV experience. All of those are very attractive and they're going to give us some run room here. Will it be forever? Who knows, but I think satellite has got several more quarters of good growth relative to the cable choices and we are gratified that it's working that way. John do you want to ad anything? John Malone Yeah. I mean, just looking at quarterly results, the cable guys are still eating into the telcos and data telephony. The video side seems to be favoring satellite at the moment. I think primarily driven by more choice in high definition which is clearly an edge at the moment in virtually all markets, so DirecTV over any of its competitors and I think also Direct has done an excellent job of differentiating itself in the sports. So now if they have high-def sports but have -- they can -- its actually the high end, it's at the high road in differentiated sports, so whether its investment in Sunday ticket or what they do on NASCAR in terms of multiple channels, when the races are on. They have done an excellent job of exploiting differentiated content, Hi-Fi definition that’s given the public rather accelerating take up of high definition now on a larger screen its pretty clear. I use the analogy the other way, I have got a treadmill and my wife brought me a large screen TV that's three feet away from the treadmill and DirecTV which we have at home is currently offering most of their high-def channels back-to-back with their standard definition channels, so you can by clicking back and forward you can see the football game in high-def from standard def and its dramatic to the point where, if I could only watch at standard def I probably would be very unhappy and thus seek an alternate supplier. And I think that that is starting to impact the high end of the marketplace in favor of DirecTV and as Greg says, it's hard to project how long it will take cable to be able to come up with something equivalent.  But I don't believe that switch digital which is essentially the technological solutions that the cable industry is hanging their hat on will be adequate to close the gap and certainly not adequate on ubiquitous spaces. So that these opportunities to differentiate on high def wire power will persist for an extended period of time and at least part of the country and it's satellite will be able to exploit that and simply DirecTV.  So obviously, we are thrilled with current results and we think that they press which is pretty strong potential in the exploitation of video. I wouldn’t try for the cable, I mean they are doing extremely well, with higher margin of products that they are eating into the telcos. Greg Maffei And going forward, I guess going back, we had a period where we see cable had a big advantage because of bundle and they do. They, as John notes are generating lots of RGUs even at a perhaps with slow rate versus telcos, but they generate a lot of RGUs and taking telco share. During that time people were quite negative about DirecTV, many people and we saw and frankly followed what the management team there did. We are not going to claim credit, but we saw they were doing endorsers of it in terms of their bet on the video capabilities and the video experience, and we see that paying off. As John notes, how long that will go on, this is the constant game of innovation, and the key is to find niches where you can be the leader and be providing a differentiated experience. And we think Direct's got lots of room to do that. For now in HD, and I think down the road, in content and the TV experience, what they have planned could be very interesting and very powerful. The last thing I'd note is the opportunity created by having a national business, the one offset that we appreciate. And I think if the Direct team, it's management team is smarter, we can help is way to think about exploring the fact that we have national business. The guys who are hurrying the most are the ones who ended buyer from the strongest telco product and where the telcos have been strong, and obviously, particularly where they have files, that is a tough product to compete against, particularly given the amount of marketing and dollars that is being invested by the telcos. And we're lucky to have a balanced business that can absorb, a), one of the areas where we were strongest, DirecTV; b) we have an ability to grow another market. John Malone I think I would add to what Greg is saying about ubiquity. When you have a national business, your services are ubiquitously available. It gives you enormous opportunities in content that frankly TCI and cable never had because of the vulcanization of the cable footprint. So that is a very important ingredient long-term that favors the satellite footprint over the cable footprint; i.e. the ability to make a decision on content and have that content available ubiquitously across the whole country. A cable operator, even one as big as Brian, I think you know, is still limited to a footprint that may be 35% of the country. And then, only if all of these facilities are equally capable of adding an incremental service as DirecTV, if they have room to add an incremental service, it automatically is incrementally available on a national scale. This is a huge advantage for satellite over cable. And really when I've been on the other side of the equation, I used to worry about that a great deal. Greg Maffei Cable has lots of advantages by being regional, and they are doing quite well. And the best case for everybody would probably be if people gravitate towards their respective strengths and to some degree that's happening. We'll see how it plays. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley Thanks, guys. Operator And we will move next to Jeff Shelton with Natexis. Jeff Shelton - Natexis Thanks. Just one quick IAC follow-up question. At this point do you guys have any hard blocking rights over the ultimate IAC spin-off structure? Greg Maffei That's a legal question. Chris Shean Yeah. I think we would argue that there are restrictions on what IAC can do and not do, but we'll have some of that dialogue with IAC. Greg Maffei But as announced, the answer is yes. Jeff Shelton - Natexis Does there need to be another Board vote or not? Greg Maffei Yeah. There will have to be many Board deliberations at IAC before the actual spin-off can be implemented, and it will have to be a resolution of these open issues relative to the relationship between Barry and Liberty. Jeff Shelton - Natexis Thank you. Chris Shean Maybe two more questions. Operator Okay. We'll go to April Horace with Janco Partner. April Horace - Janco Partner Hi. Thanks. Quick question on QVC. I was wondering are you guys exploring, moving to more of an interactive platform, similar to what HSN did with Dish, and do you think that would add incrementally to the revenue streams? Mike George April, we do explore it. We had tested interactive applications a few years ago, and didn't see a lot of benefit at that time. As you may know, we have an interactive application in the UK, which we've had for over five years. So we can't pioneer that concept in our UK business. And so I think we know a fair amount about it from our learning's in the UK. At a high level, we don't see it being much of a revenue driver. And certainly, our five years of experience in the UK as well as our testing that we did in the US, in neither of those experiences do we feel that it materially added to revenue. But it can save some expenses, depending on whether people use that application versus a live operator or an automated voice response unit or the internet. So depending on what ordering mechanism it substitutes for, there can be a modest cost saving. So we remain interested in it, and as the technologies mature and as it becomes an easier experience for customers, I think it's probably likely that we will adopt interactive application. For us, the upside is to look down the road and to see whether beyond just simplifying new ordering mechanism, there are really value-added applications that create a superior experience for the customer, and I don't think that technology is quite there yet. But it will probably come. We're going to be testing a number of really interesting applications in our UK business next year on this platform. That will basically give the customer a choice of watching the live show, or watching a video-on-demand channel, or watching shows that had aired earlier in the day, so that it gives the customer more choice and control over what she is watching on TV. So, obviously that platform is different in the UK than what we have in the US market. So, long we are saying, we think it's interesting, we know quite a bit about it. At the right time in the US we'll probably do something. Do we see it as being a significant revenue adder? Maybe in the long-term if some of these value-added applications are merged. So, not yet, but potentially down the road. John Malone I think one of the most interesting potential applications, as you know DVRs are exploding in terms of take up rate. The ability to push video into the DVR and make it randomly accessible by the consumer could well be the application that ultimately benefits QVC in terms of broadening its audience and giving better access to selected products or something of that nature. So, I have longed been proponent of interactive television. If the opportunities are still there the technology has not quite matured on the video side, the way it has on the Internet side, when it finally does, I think the ability to sell products to mass audiences on an impulse basis will turn out to be huge. The only place that we've ever seen it demonstrated are what you call per inquiry type adds, which is actually a pretty big industry by the way of somewhat [sloppy] products and still generating some huge amount of revenue both for network owners, as well as for proprietors. And that's sort of a demonstration of the fire power if you can put an offer in front of the large audience. And the opportunity to do that which may not be QVC's specific as much as it is a benefit say to do DirecTV eventually or anybody who can network and preload make video-on-demand a reality on a real-time basis and then cross promote it. I think it still remains unexploited, but very large opportunity.  Chris Shean Great. Last question please. Operator And your last question will come from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Yes, good morning. I wanted to know, if you could talk a little bit more about Starz Media. How big the feature film slate is going to be, the impact on OpEx and synergies other parts of Liberty?  Chris Shean Hey, Bob do you want to comment?  Bob Clasen Sure. Overture Films is looking at 40 titles, a whole slate of films over the next five years, so eight to 10 each year. They've already announced the first eight films and we would expect that there will be about seven or eight released in 2008. And again, these films are typically in a negative cost range anywhere from $5 million to north of $50 million. Although, our focus is acquiring only US rights. And so as we've reported we are looking to have an average acquisition price or production price of only about $15 million. We are actually thrilled with their initial slate that includes Righteous Kill with Al Pacino and DeNiro, very highly anticipated, and just wrapped. We are just finishing an Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman film in London, and of course, the Mad Money story is almost everywhere from People Magazine to Oprah. So, there is an awful lot of excitement about that that will be released in January. Our view of this, of course, as we have said before, is that Starz Entertainment acquires about a 110 new output titles each year to fuel our viewer ship on the Starz channels. And that buying eight or 10 of those a year from ourselves and our affiliate companies seem to make a lot of sense, and we think there are other synergies to our home entertainment business through Anchor Bay, that will distributing these domestically as they come to that market, also digitally. We have a company now that division within Starz Media that sells to everyone from Netflix to AOL to Amazon and we will be very active, moving product to the new digital technology, so they become available. So, we think it works very well on an integrated basis, and will give us very high quality films to anchor our entertainment channels. And then of course go into our library after they have gone through their broadcast window and so on and they will be available for us over the next 10, 15, 20 years. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Do your current suppliers feel any kind of competitive pressure from you at all? Bob Clasen Well, that's a great question. I remember for the first time meeting, with Universal a few years ago, and they actually took the other position at Universal and I think that Sony. We think differently, if you also produce product as opposed to just being a passive distributor, and our relationships, I think, with most of our major studio partners, and the Disney lawsuit aside, are very positive and there are a number of studios who are concerned, obviously, about status of their pay TV deals. And we have become over the last few year the largest acquirer of independent films because of all the channels we have to fill for the premium space and are looking to actually acquire even more rights for those for your home video and even for domestic television which will give us another spin anchored by our ability to put them on a pay television service. And I think that we are exploring with the number of the other studios, things that we might do together on a production basis that would give them some access to Starz pay business but also give us an opportunity to leverage their tremendous production capacity and creative environments. So, I think the synergies are kind of popping out all over the place frankly. Mike George Well I think Overture and Starz Media open up a whole bunch of options. Bob has noted that I think we are just beginning to explore hopefully over the next couple of years we really be able to take advantage of. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Hey. Great thank you. Greg Maffei Thank you, operator and everybody who listened in and asked questions and we look forward to talking to you at the end of Q4, if not before.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Maffei.  Gregory B. Maffei Thank you, and thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in Liberty Media. We’ve had another active year to report on, and I’m going to discuss a little bit today with some help from others.  We’re going to talk about our operational performance at our controlled subsidiaries. We’re going to talk about some transactions that we announced and/or completed during the year, and I’m going to talk to you a little about some recent developments that have happened after the end of the calendar year and a little bit about what we expect to be doing or attempting to do in 2008.  On the call with me today, I have QVC’s CEO Mike George and CFO Dan O’Connell; Starz Chairman and CEO Bob Clasen; President and COO Bill Myers, and EVP and CFO Glenn Curtis. Several other senior Liberty Media executives are on the call as well, including Chris Shean, our Controller, who’s going to discuss some of the results. So, let me start by talking about LCAPA. Finally, and I emphasize that word, we closed our exchange with News Corp. It does not seem like just yesterday we did that deal. It seems like a long time ago. But we’re very happy to have it done. We’re thrilled to have Chase Carey and the entire DirecTV team joining part of the Liberty family. We’re excited about the prospects of working together. There were certainly doubters at the time we did that deal; people who thought that we were getting the lesser of the bargain; we were being forced into this trade. You can come up with whatever analogy or suggestion you want.  We believed and do believe that DTV’s management was absolutely on the right track. We believe in the strength of satellite as a video platform. We believe there would be good demand for HD and video breadth.  We believe in the power of sports and other unique content, and we believe that there would be or could be slowing demand for the triple play. Fortunately, those things have come to pass, and DirecTV had a fabulous 2007 and looks to be continuing forward in 2008. This is a great deal for Liberty on several fronts. First, since we announced the deal, it has accreted substantially. On the basis of just sort of the raw numbers in the swap, we’re up about $3 billion.  Secondly, we have a substantially increased tax basis, and you know that matters to Liberty. We’re up about $5 billion in terms of the tax basis of the assets that we receive versus the assets we gave.  We have enormously increased financial flexibility given the underleveraged balance sheet of DirecTV, where it’s currently got less than one times debt just looking at the consolidated subsidiaries there. And as I said, we continue to be impressed with the strong performance of DirecTV. As they outlined in their investor presentation this morning, DTV’s sub growth continues, its churn is down, its ARPU is up and it seemingly has not been affected by economic conditions. It’s outperformed its peers substantially. And that doesn’t even look at the hidden gems in there like Latin America, which had another fabulous year. So, we’re very excited about what DirecTV is doing and we’re excited about how we can work together and how it can create a strategic center for Liberty Entertainment and really for Liberty Media as a whole. The next phase of our efforts at Liberty Capital will be the issuance of the Liberty Entertainment tracker. We expect that to begin trading Tuesday morning. In the fourth quarter, the shareholders approved Liberty Entertainment, as you know, and in Liberty Entertainment we’ll have the following attributed assets: 41% of DirecTV; all of Starz Entertainment and our three regional sports networks in Seattle, Denver and Pittsburgh; our 50% interest in the Game Show Network, GSN; and our 100% interest in FUN and our equity interest in WildBlue.  We’ll be attributing $550 million of exchangeable debt and about $1 billion dollars of cash. Liberty Capital, and let’s call it new Liberty Capital for this purpose, will have all the attributed assets, businesses and liabilities that were previously in Liberty Capital, except for those that I’ve just mentioned that are going into Liberty Entertainment. Why are we doing this? The purpose of these new trackers is hopefully to continue to reduce complexity at Liberty Entertainment in particular; to allow investors to further focus their investment in the vehicle that is most attractive to them; to create a currency we hope for enhanced financial flexibility, and to further concentrate what we consider our non-core assets at that new Liberty Capital. So, during 2007, we did a whole host of 355 transactions and other transactions which had the impact of reducing flexibility and tax-efficiently reducing our exposure. We exchanged our interest in CBS for a CBS affiliate in Green Bay and cash. We exchanged a portion of our interest in Time Warner for the Atlanta Braves, Leisure Arts, and cash. And in the fourth quarter, we also purchased the balance of FUN Technologies to bring our interest up to 100%. During the year, LCAPA had good performance in its operating units led by Starz, which had truly spectacular operating cash flow growth. Chris is going to cover a little bit more about that later, and Bob Clasen will talk to you about how they’re doing this year.  But there were good results at several other Liberty Capital businesses, and I already mentioned the strong results at DirecTV. Finally, looking at Liberty Capital, we bought back about 11.5 million shares for $1.3 billion. Turning to LINTA, Liberty Interactive, operating results were more challenged in a difficult retail environment, and QVC’s growth in particular was slowed. We are and remain confident in the long term outlook and strategy at QVC, and you’ll hear more about that from Mike George. We also had good to very good growth at our e-commerce companies and affiliates. And Chris Shean will cover more of those details momentarily. We made additional e-commerce acquisitions. Backcountry, a leading provider of ski and other outdoor gear, had a tremendous year and is continuing to do very well in 2008. And Bodybuilding.com, which we closed right at year-end, had a very good finish and continues to look like a great business that we’re very happy to be involved with.  Both of these businesses fit well with our e-commerce businesses that we already had, Provide and BUYSEASONS. Why? Great growth, good strategic fit, leaders in niche categories with great management teams and exciting growth prospects, so we’re very happy with those. Finally, rounding out on the balance sheet side a little bit, we continued to repurchase shares at Liberty Interactive. We bought back 56 million shares during the year for $1.2 billion. That represents just about 16% of the shares outstanding since we began Liberty Interactive or it began trading in May of 2006. And we still have financial flexibility with leverage just under four times on the operating units, both on a trailing and pro forma basis.  And finally, to finish on Liberty Interactive, we purchased 14 million additional shares of IAC. Obviously, due to the pending litigation with IAC, I’m going to be limited in what I can comment upon. So, with that, let me turn it over to Chris and let him talk about Liberty Capital’s results first. Christopher W. Shean Thanks, Greg. The current slide is a quick snapshot of Liberty Capital’s results for the fourth quarter and full year. During 2007, Liberty Capital’s revenue increased 26% to just over $1.6 billion, while operating cash flow declined 56% to $45 million.  LCAP’s largest attributed operating asset, Starz Entertainment, which I point out does not include Starz Media, is continuing to strengthen its cash flow. Meanwhile, the addition of some new business units materially impacted both revenue and operating cash flow.  During the fourth quarter, Liberty Capital experienced 4% revenue growth, while operating cash flow decreased due to a modest decline at Starz Entertainment and the addition of new business units. Taking a closer look at Liberty Capital, as I just mentioned, its attributed revenue grew 4% in the fourth quarter and 26% in 2007, while OCF declined in both periods.  Revenue growth in both periods resulted from modest revenue growth at Starz Entertainment, coupled with the inclusion of Starz Media and the Atlanta Braves, partially offset by lower GAAP revenue at TruePosition, which we had mentioned in previous calls has had some revenue recognition problems from an accounting standpoint that continued to impact its accounting treatment.  The decline in OCF was primarily driven by the inclusion of a sizable full year operating flow cash deficit at Starz Media and losses at TruePosition, again, partially offset by significant growth of Starz Entertainment and the inclusion of the Atlanta Braves. Fourth quarter decline in OCF was due primarily to Starz Media and TruePosition. As Greg mentioned a few minutes ago, we’re pleased to have completed the exchange transaction with News Corp. and are now finalizing the reclassification of the Liberty Capital tracking stock, which was approved by our shareholders in October.  We also made further progress during the year monetizing some of our non-controlled or non-strategic equity stakes through section 355 exchanges with both Time Warner and CBS. As we continued our efforts to complete the News exchange during the second half of the year, we did not use any of the significant capital resources attributed to Liberty Capital to repurchase common stock.  Earlier in the year, we repurchased 11.5 million shares of LCAPA, representing approximately 8.2% of the shares outstanding. Upon issuance of the new trackers, we expect to hold large cash reserves and have access to capital at both the Liberty Capital Group, I guess we should say the new Liberty Capital Group, and the soon to be formed Liberty Entertainment Group. Now, taking a quick look at Starz, Starz Entertainment continued to experience solid subscriber growth during 2007 as Starz’ average subscribers increased 8% while Encore’s grew 9% for the year.  This subscriber growth, along with a higher effective rate due to the retroactive effects of revenue recognition on our DirecTV contract extension, resulted in 3% revenue growth. Our growth for the year was partially mitigated by the fixed rate agreement Starz has entered into in recent years, and the shift of former Adelphia subscribers to lower rate Comcast and Time Warner affiliation agreements.  Starz’ operating cash flow increased 42% in 2007, as programming cost reductions of 7% were only modestly offset by higher SG&A expenses. Starz also was aided on the operating expense side by the third quarter reversal of an accrual or a reserve that it set up for music copyright fees in which we had a more favorable settlement.  This reduction in programming costs during 2007 resulted from the lower effective rates for the movies that were shown, partially offset by increased costs from a higher ratio of first run movie exhibitions.  In the fourth quarter, revenue continued its full year trend, growing 3%, primarily due to subscriber growth, partially diluted by the previously mentioned fixed rate agreements. Operating expenses grew 5% during the quarter, as the company increased its marketing activity, resulting in a 4% decline in operating cash flow.  Now, Bob Clasen would like to say a few words about Starz Entertainment and Starz Media. Robert B. Clasen Starz Entertainment did have a strong year in 2007 with an increase in our cash flow by $78 million at 42%, that Chris referred to, largely because of reduced costs for movies and because of continued growth in subscribers.  This year we’ve begun to roll out our first efforts in the original programming arena. This will provide us with exclusive proprietary programming that can run on our channels and generate future revenue through home video and syndication.  We’ve premiered our first two half-hour original comedy series in January. In September, we will premiere our first hour-long original drama, Crash, based on the academy award winning best picture. This is a joint project with Lions Gate. We expect to continue to increase the amounts of original programming on our channels at a modest but steady pace over the coming years.  We are also launching this year a nationwide branding campaign to generate increased consumer awareness for our originals and for the Starz brand. On the Starz Media side, in 2007 we realized losses associated with the start-up of Overture Films and costs related to projects that had been green-lit prior to our acquisition of the company in August 2006.  As a result of the production and marketing costs at Overture and Starz Media for this year, we expect the losses to continue as we create a library of product for our various distribution networks.  Overture has assembled an impressive slate of films for 2008 and released the first one, Mad Money, in January. Now, it will be a great product for our Anchor Bay home video division and for the Starz and Encore channels later this year.  The next Overture film, Sleepwalking, with Charlize Theron and Dennis Hopper will premiere March 14. And then the third film, The Visitor, will premiere on April 11. In other theatrical initiatives, our Starz Media Toronto animation studios last year contracted for work on three animated theatrical films and our Film Roman studio performed the animation for the hit, Simpsons Movie, which was released last summer, and it continues to produce the television series, as well as the new Simpsons ride at Universal Studios.  Anchor Bay Entertainment continued to release limited theatrical films which then go to home video. Our next one, The Grand, starring Woody Harrelson, will premiere in theaters March 21. On the television side, Starz Media during 2007 produced television movies for Lifetime and Sci Fi and found additional overseas market for the hit animated children’s series Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! which is aired on Nick Jr. and Noggin here in the United States.  We’re pleased with the progress that we’ve made on all fronts last year and we look forward to more of the same in 2008. I’ll now return it back to Chris. Christopher W. Shean Thanks, Bob. Let’s now take a quick look at Liberty Capital’s liquidity situation. The LCAPA businesses remained in a position of financial strength. At year-end, LCAPA was attributed with approximately $15.6 billion in public investments and derivatives. This represented about a $1.25 billion decline from the end of the third quarter, largely due to market value decreases in our News Corp. position.  In addition to its public holdings, Liberty Capital had attributed cash and liquid investments of about $2.7 billion at year-end. Total cash and public holdings approximated $18.3 billion, and were only partially offset by $5.3 billion face amount of attributed debt.  Upon the issuance of the new tracking stocks, approximately $1 billion of cash and $550 million of LCAPA debt will be attributed to the Liberty Entertainment Group, with the new LCAPA retaining the balance of the cash and debt.  The DirecTV investment and the RSNs received in the News Corp. exchange will be attributed to the Liberty Entertainment Group. Both Liberty Entertainment and Liberty Capital will have significant financial flexibility which will play an important role in the strategic direction of both groups going forward. Now, let’s take a look at Liberty Interactive’s businesses. This quick snapshot of the fourth quarter and full year revenue and OCF performance indicates that Liberty Interactive’s attributed businesses continued a slower pace of revenue growth and experienced flat operating cash flow for the year and a decline in OCF during the fourth quarter.  QVC is the principal driver of performance among the Liberty Interactive attributed assets, and its performance slowed in 2007. This was primarily driven by the continuation of difficult retail market conditions, challenging comparisons with last year’s strong results for the same periods, and continuing operational challenges at QVC’s international businesses, most notably, Japan and Germany. We’ll talk a bit more about this shortly. Looking more closely at Liberty Interactive, for the year, Liberty Interactive’s businesses achieved 6% revenue growth while operating cash flow was largely flat. As I will discuss in a bit more detail in a moment, the pace of revenue growth slowed at QVC in 2007 and operating cash flow remained at prior-year levels.  Provide Commerce and BUYSEASONS, which were acquired in 2006, experienced modest fourth quarter revenue growth and delivered solid full-year revenue gains.  Backcountry, which was acquired in June, experienced 60% revenue expansion during the quarter and 68% growth for the year, coupled with strong gains in operating cash flow.  At year-end, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Bodybuilding.com, which is a leading sports nutrition electronic retailer, and is the most visited body building and fitness site in the world.  We’re pleased to add Bodybuilding to our existing group of e-commerce businesses and are excited about its prospects. Bodybuilding’s results will be consolidated beginning in the first quarter of this year, and the business will be attributed to the Liberty Interactive Group. As Greg mentioned earlier, we repurchased a significant number of Liberty Interactive shares during the year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 20 million shares for $403 million. In total, we repurchased more than 56 million shares in 2007 for $1.2 billion.  Since inception of the Liberty Interactive share repurchase program, we have now reacquired nearly 16% of the original outstanding share count. We continue to believe in share repurchases as a good means of enhancing shareholder value, and we’ll continue to evaluate opportunities to cost effectively shrink Liberty Interactive equity. Now, let’s take a closer look at QVC’s 2007 performance. QVC experienced consolidated revenue growth of 5% to $7.4 billion in 2007, while OCF was largely unchanged at $1.65 billion.  Revenue growth, while slower than 2006 levels, was achieved without promotional efforts, and we believe the business is poised for long-term health. Operating cash flow comparisons were impacted by a one-time $15 million reversal of franchise tax reserves, which increased OCF in the fourth quarter of 2006 and comparatively lowered gross margins stemming from changes in product mix in the fourth quarter of 2007.  Domestic revenue grew 5% in 2007 to $5.2 billion, mainly due to a product mix shift away from jewelry to the home and apparel and accessories categories. Total units shipped in 2007 increased 2% to $122.2 million, while the average selling price grew 3% to $46.05.  Domestic OCF increased 1% for the year to $1.24 billion, while the operating cash flow margin declined 80 basis points to 23.9%, primarily due to difficult comparisons stemming from the previously mentioned 2006 franchise tax reserve reversal.  QVC.com sales continued to grow as a percentage of overall domestic sales, rising from 20% in 2006 to 22% this year.  International revenue increased 5% to $2.2 billion for the year while OCF declined 4% to $408 million. Revenue growth was due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates in the U.K. and Germany, partially offset by operational challenges in Germany and the ongoing effect of changes in the enforcement of Japan’s regulation of the marketing of health and beauty aids.  The operating cash flow decline was due to lower gross margins that were the result of higher inventory obsolescence provisions; higher commission expense as a percentage of net revenue; and costs associated with the opening of the new distribution center in Japan.  Excluding the effect of exchange rates, international revenue declined 1% in 2007, while OCF declined 9%. International operating cash flow margins declined 170 basis points during the year to 18.6%. As we’ve discussed throughout the year, QVC’s German and Japanese operations faced market challenges in 2007. The German business was impacted by revenue declines across all product categories, as average selling price and units shipped declined, resulting in a 6% local currency revenue decline.  The German business also experienced a lower gross margin percentage, primarily due to a higher inventory obsolescence provision and, to a lesser extent, lower initial product margins. Japan’s revenue in local currency decreased 2% for the year as businesses faced heightened regulatory focus on the market of HBA product.  QVC management in Japan has continued to shift product away from the health and beauty category to jewelry and fashion and is experiencing productivity gains in these areas. QVC U.K. continued to show improved results with revenue increasing 7% in local currency during the year. Now, let’s examine QVC’s fourth quarter results. Their fourth quarter results showed a continuation of the slower growth that was experienced throughout the year. Consolidated revenue for the quarter grew 4%, while OCF declined 5%.  Domestically, QVC experienced 4% revenue growth and a 5% decline in OCF. Revenue growth was primarily due to increased sales of electronics in the home category, while the operating cash flow decline was largely the result of difficult comparisons stemming from the previously mentioned franchise tax reserve adjustment in the prior year.  QVC.com accounted for 22.5% of the sales in the fourth quarter. QVC’s international revenue grew 4% during the quarter, while operating cash flow declined 4%. Revenue growth stemmed from favorable exchange rates in all markets, partially offset by the continued challenges in Germany and Japan.  The operating cash flow decline was due to lower gross margins that were the result of higher inventory obsolescence provisions; higher commission expense as a percentage of net revenue; and costs associated with opening the new distribution center in Japan.  Excluding the effect of exchange rates, international revenue declined 4% in the quarter while OCF declined 11%. International operating cash flow margins declined 160 basis points during the quarter to 20.5%.  Before I review the Liberty Interactive liquidity picture, I’m going to turn the call over to QVC’s President and CEO, Mike George, who will discuss QVC in a bit more detail.  Michael A. George Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned, we saw a modest sales rebound in the U.S. from the low levels of Q3, I think a solid result versus the rest of the retail marketplace but clearly below the levels that we would like to see.  We saw continued softness in the jewelry category, which has been a challenge all year, and some softness in our apparel business as well. The bright spot was consumer electronics; we saw a very high take rate in categories like GPS units, LCD TVs and personal computers.  And as Chris mentioned, our OCF was also very challenged in the U.S., primarily for reasons of margin mix and these one-time benefits that we did not anniversary, as Chris mentioned. So, the mix shift out of apparel and jewelry into consumer electronics clearly had a big negative impact on our margin rate in the quarter. One of the things we’ve talked about on prior calls is that we try to maintain very stable margins; we do not move to do a lot of promotional activity when sales are weak.  We maintained that philosophy in the quarter; we did not take excessive markdowns or add heavy promotions. So, what you see in the OCF result really is an outcome of this mix shift into the home electronics category. That’s something we’ll watch but we’re not overly concerned about it.  Over time we think we can continue to maintain relatively stable margins, but to the extent that those categories are growing quickly, they will have some depressive effect on net margins, but we think the Q4 result was really exaggerated from what we would normally expect to see.  There’s also a modest impact of us opening the new distribution center in Florence, which also weighed down our OCF in the quarter, and we’ll anniversary that middle of next year. We did keep a tight control on expenses and maintained fairly clean inventory levels given the general softness in the market, so we don’t have any big concerns in those areas.  We launched our new brand identity and brand campaign in Q4 which we felt very good about and launched a complete makeover of the web site in early November, which we think gives us a lot to build on, although it did slow the rate of growth in the Internet in Q4 as customers got used to the new site, but we think that’s more of a one-time issue with the transition to the new site. We felt very good about the business in the U.K. They’ve continued to improve their results all year, and if anything, the results are a little bit better than they appear because there was a protracted Royal Mail strike in October, so we had very tough results in October due to the mail strike, and then a very nice rebound in November and December.  We did see a little bit of a decline in OCF yield in U.K. primarily due to the signing of a new long-term contract for DTT carriage, and also just some of the one-time expenses associated with this mail strike, but overall feel very good about our business in the U.K. Germany, on the other hand, continues to be a challenge. The story is consistent with past calls. Our top line results were weak, especially in the jewelry category, and also in apparel, although we saw a little bit of strengthening in the home store.  Despite the poor overall results, though, we did feel that we’ve made some positive steps in the turnaround program. We have been focusing on trying to move much more to an everyday pricing strategy as opposed to a more promotional orientation, which that business had adopted in the prior couple of years.  And we’ve made some progress there, we reduced the amount of business done at promotional prices, increased the everyday price business and stabilized our initial margins. So, our initial margins were much healthier than in Q3 and again much less promotional activity. Our second priority in Germany is to continue to add new programs and brands to diversify the mix, and we added over 40 new concepts in the quarter. That’s a big increase from prior quarters, and I think that bodes well for the future.  Both of those initiatives did hurt the top line velocity, so this is something that is going to take awhile to build, but as you know, we’re committed to rebuilding the business in a very methodical way, and are trying to develop an approach that will be healthy for the long term. Japan, as Chris mentioned, also continued to struggle due to these regulatory issues. We began discussing those in Q1. They have continued to build through the course of the year as we had to take more and more products off of the channel to meet regulatory requirements in health, beauty, and fitness.  We probably reached the low water mark in around October. So, this has created an increasing level of challenges as we’ve gone through the year. But we do feel good about our progress offsetting those losses with very strong gains in apparel, accessories and jewelry.  If anything, we’re probably a little bit ahead of schedule in growing those businesses and, on the flip side, the impact of the regulations has been even more severe than we had anticipated when we first started discussing it.  So it will take us until October of 2008 to fully anniversary the pullback in those categories, although the comparisons start to get a little bit easier in March, but not fully offset until October.  And with that, I’ll turn it back to Chris. Christopher W. Shean Thanks, Mike. Let’s take a look at some Liberty Interactive balance sheet metrics. We continue to maintain a strong capital structure and good liquidity at the businesses attributed to Liberty Interactive.  The Group has attributed cash and public investments of $4.8 billion, and has $7.2 billion of attributed debt. Excluding the value of the positions in Expedia and IAC, Liberty Interactive’s year-ending attributed net debt of just over $6.6 billion equates to a multiple of approximately 3.9 times annual operating cash flow. As previously stated, we would be comfortable sustaining net debt levels of four to five times OCF. As a result, the Liberty Interactive businesses are approaching optimal leverage, but we do feel like we have remaining capacity to pursue growth in capital structure management objectives. Now, with that, I think Greg would like to quickly recap the year and talk about what’s ahead for 2008. Gregory B. Maffei Thanks, Chris. I think you’ve heard all this: active year; got the News deal which took far longer from a regulatory perspective than we had anticipated or hoped, but we got it done. You, the shareholders, were kind enough to approve our new tracking stock. We did get some complexity out of Liberty Capital, we hope to do more, and we had good operating results at Starz as Bob Clasen and Chris both talked about. And we got a large shelf tender done. At Liberty Interactive, in what is a very difficult retail environment, and some self-inflicted issues, we performed okay. We’re still, as we said, very confident about the business, and we believe management has a firm handle on what was wrong and where we’re headed.  We added two strong complementary e-commerce businesses that fit perfectly our profile. We’d love to add a whole bunch more like that. Unfortunately, they don’t exist, or it’s certainly not at any price we’re willing to pay, but we’ll be judicious and look at them going forward.  We bought the additional IAC shares, and we made significant share repurchases at Liberty Interactive of its own stock.  So, let me turn to the last slide and talk a little about where we’re headed. As we said, we’re imminently about ready to introduce our new tracker, expected to become official Monday at 5:00 p.m. and start trading Tuesday morning. At LMDIA, Liberty Entertainment, we’re going to develop and implement a strategy for our new DirecTV holding. We really just closed that yesterday. We have some ideas about where we want to go but they’re still in formation and we’re going to be talking quite a lot more with the Direct management team about that.  We do hope to utilize some of the financial flexibility at Liberty Entertainment, LMDIA, to make strategic acquisitions, and we’re going to look at ways to optimize that capital structure. At LINTA, Liberty Interactive, we’re hoping for improved operational performance at QVC, and targeting that, we will be seeking additional strategic e-commerce acquisitions, but, if you look at where we’ve spent the capital at Liberty Interactive since its formation, the vast, vast majority has gone to share repurchase, and I expect that over 2008, you’ll get more of the same.  I will be out there looking for strategic acquisitions, we won’t find the number that we wish or the size that we wish at the price that we’re willing to pay, and therefore, much of the excess free cash flow will go to share repurchase.  We’ll work to perfect, and that sounds like a nice neutral word, perfect our IAC and Expedia stakes, and we will continue to actively manage the capital structure. And lastly, at new Liberty Capital, which will be the RevCo of leftover businesses, we’re going to continue our efforts to reduce complexity and transition out of the passive assets that we have in there to more operating assets and cash.  So, with that, let me thank you for listening, and if myself or the management team can answer questions, we are happy to do so.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator Our first question today comes from Kit Spring - Stifel. Kit Spring - Stifel  Could you talk about what assets you might potentially want out of Sprint, Motorola or Time Warner, and which of those you think are most likely? And then maybe also talk a little bit about the value of the derivatives hedging those positions; if there have been any changes that you can discuss? Thanks. Gregory Maffei Because there surely will be confusion. All of those positions and all of those derivatives will be in new Liberty Capital, and all of those positions are hedged to some degree or other. So, looking at what’s in Sprint that might be interesting, we’ve had some preliminary discussions, mostly, frankly, with the old management team at Sprint, not too much with the new.  They understandably might not look at us as their first priority, settling out with what we want to do. They’ve got other challenges, which we understand, and there are certainly some spectrum assets or some, perhaps, the long distance fiber business, which would be worth talking about.  Are they highly strategic to us? No, that’s part of the reason why this is a Liberty Capital deal, and you’d have to figure that out whether they would actually qualify as a good operating business, for the example in the case of some of the spectrum. So on Motorola, had very limited conversations with Motorola about some kinds of swaps, very limited, and really, that’s harder to see, just because they’re not a company that has been selling a lot of businesses, and I guess that potentially could change. There’s talk of change at Motorola, we’ll see. Time Warner, in some ways, it’s a company we’ve already done one transaction with and a company that is likely a seller or potentially a seller of businesses, and we being able to offer them tax-free transactions, I would think that’s the one where you would have the highest likelihood.  And while nothing is imminent, you could imagine they being a seller of assets that we might like, and frankly might understand better or might be able to run better, given the media characterization and nature of them, than other businesses that are out there, for example, than a Motorola would probably be a more technology-oriented business.  Neal Dermer, Vice President of Finance, do you want to make some general comments about what’s happened to the derivatives? Neal Dermer They’ve gone up in value as the stocks have gone down, so that’s really the only change there’s been, other than some positions expiring. Operator We’ll hear next from Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley  Since we’re effectively talking, I think, about three trackers, I’ll ask three questions, one for each so each one gets some attention. Maybe, Mike, on QVC, just to give us a sense for the exposure on the jewelry side and what’s happening with commodity prices, particularly gold, this continues to be an issue every quarter. Could you put into context maybe how big the jewelry business is in each of your big markets, and what the gross margin differential is so we can understand that mix shift trend over time going forward? And then, Greg, at RevCo, you’ve got a Time Warner call put in the next couple months. What do you want to do with that position? Do you want to go effectively naked long? I don’t think there’s a hedge on that stock at all anymore, or at least not on the majority of it. Any thoughts on what you want to do with the Time Warner position?  And then last but not least, on LMDIA with DirecTV, do you think it creates value at that tracker to consolidate the DirecTV business? Is that something that you believe investors will look at as a consolidated asset and assign less of a discount? Michael George I won’t get into real specific numbers on the jewelry mix, but I’ll try to frame it. So, jewelry as a general statement across our markets typically runs as a percent of the total business in the low 20s percent, although gold, as a portion of jewelry, is going to be maybe 25%, let’s say, of the jewelry business.  So, when you just focus on gold, where we’re getting the biggest impact of the commodity increases, that’s just a portion of that 20%, 25% jewelry mix. Again I won’t reveal specific margins, the jewelry margin is a little bit higher than the company average as is the apparel margin. But also to put it in context, the jewelry business has been soft in the U.S., let’s say, flat to up 2%. It’s actually rebounded and was positive in the U.K. and was positive in Japan; positive meaning growing as fast or faster than the base business. Germany, it’s soft, and the U.S. it’s soft.  So, it’s soft in two of the four markets. It’s in the low 20s as a percent of the business, and it’s our goal, again, to try to maintain stable margins. So even with that softness, I’m not giving up on us being able to keep our margin rates fairly flat over time. What hurt us in Q4 was a little bit of a unique combination of particular weakness in jewelry and apparel and very high strength in consumer electronics, which is substantially lower margin than the rest of our businesses.  And it was really that combination that caused a big margin swing. Over a long period of time, we don’t anticipate that overall margins will decline in any material way due to the jewelry issue. Gregory Maffei Great. So, on the Time Warner exchangeables, for those who are not as aware, there’s an upcoming opportunity for the holders of that debt to put that debt to us. We recently, I think it was last week, issued a press release saying that if they did put that debt to us, we would intend to pay it off with cash rather than Time Warner stock or Liberty Media, one of our trackers, both alternatives which were available to us. I don’t anticipate that actually is going to get put to us, because based on where that debt is currently trading, given the strength of the convertible market and where the Time Warner stock is, unless things change dramatically, my understanding is the bonds are trading at well above par and more unlikely to get put, but if it gets put to us, we’re likely to sell it in cash and consider other ways to raise capital as needed, when needed, against the Time Warner stock.  Now, we today effectively are hedged against any run in the Time Warner stock because we have sufficient Time Warner stock to settle that issue if we choose in Time Warner stock, but we don’t choose to. On the DirecTV and Liberty Entertainment, LMDIA, what will we do there? I think that really will depend. We love the business, we have been, as I mentioned earlier, very impressed with the management team, their strategy and what is going on there.  It was fascinating to read The Wall Street Journal today suggest we had all these major challenges in front of us, when that was what was suggested pretty much 18 months ago or 15 months ago when it was first rumored and then struck and the business has performed, as I’ve mentioned already, far better than its peer group, better than the other major satellite player, better than any of the major cable players.  So, we’re very happy with where they’re going, and what we will do going forward will be dependent on price, and how we formulate and complete our strategy. So, I don’t think we’re ready to say that today, but we like the business, we’re enthused about it, and I think we’ll likely try and work with them more closely over time. Operator We’ll now move on to Andy Baker - Jefferies & Company. Andy Baker - Jefferies & Company  Just two questions. One for Bob, just a couple years ago you said you were going to get this business up to $275 million of operating cash flow and everyone stared at you with blank faces and, you did it now.  The question is, how does growth come going forward, now that arguably some of the easy lifting has been done and especially as you roll out more content that you’re creating yourself?  And then for Greg, forgive me, I’ve been out of the loop a little bit, but are you still standing by on the LINTA side, the long-term guidance of low double digit operating cash flow growth? Robert Clasen The answer, I think, comes in four or five different areas. First of all, we think we’ve just scratched the surface with what to do with digital work, both with our affiliates and with consumer electronics; the market certainly has jumped up around us, and we think that there is an opportunity for us, given especially the long-term movie deals that we have, to continue to look for ways to capitalize on that, the Internet and digital. The whole entrance into originals is also an opportunity to move the top line. As I said, this first project is a joint venture with Lions Gate. So, we’re not just licensing content anymore, we’re actually owning content, and we’re developing, of course, in Starz Media some of our own.  But from Liberty Entertainment’s perspective, this is a chance to use the content to sell overseas, to sell through our own home video company, have our own people at Media syndicate it, so we think that there are some synergies there. And we think that there is an opportunity in short form, and we’re doing a lot, looking at our own movie libraries, we’re looking at the Internet and we’re looking with our affiliates to see ways that in mobile, as well as on their own affiliate web site, the ways that we should provide content for them that’s this short form that lets us generate some revenue.  So, it’s around the edges; we have a gigantic, reasonably stable business, and now it’s a matter of looking outside the core to these other opportunities. Andy Baker - Jefferies & Company  And does this pressure the cost side? Robert Clasen On the cost side, we expect that we’re going to be more efficient buyers over time of content. Both Sony and Disney, wisely for them, extended their agreements last year, and I think it’s four and five years from now that they still have content coming to us under those old agreements.  We think that as we look to the market today, we’d like other content put around that at 40% and 50% and 60% less than we would have been paying even three and four years ago. Gregory Maffei One way to look at this is we are having a very positive tailwind of reduced costs in programming, largely driven by declining prices of films. And in fact, our level is artificially high for a period because of those long-term contracts we have with Sony and Disney. So, there’s actually pent-up further decline based on when those move to a larger market rate or a more market rate.  And what Bob and his team are doing is reinvesting a portion, a relatively small portion of that programming (inaudible) and that programming budget in more originals and more ways to reach (inaudible) for the channel and the properties overall, and we think it’s a great strategy. Robert Clasen Another point about the cost side is that about 10% of the new output movies, which is the bulk of our expense, we’re now buying from ourselves through Overture films. Gregory Maffei And, Andy, on the second part, do we stand by the long-term growth rate for LINTA? Yes. But I’ll embellish a teeny bit. Obviously the largest variable there has been QVC. QVC looks like a wave cycle in terms of its growth.  If you look back 4 years ago, it was 4%, then it was 8%, then it was 12%, then it was 8%, and where it looks like we’re obviously in a down year on 2007 against that, but we have no reason to believe fundamentally there is variation in the long-term growth rate, that it’ll be cyclical, it will move around, that’s why we don’t give quarterly guidance or even annual guidance, but we’re comfortable with that long-term rate. Andy Baker - Jefferies & Company  When can you get back in the market now that you’ve reported results for buying stock at LINTA? Gregory Maffei I don’t believe we actually make public our trade windows. Operator Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet - Citi. Jason Bazinet - Citi  I was wondering if you could just remind us of the flexibility and the mechanism by which you would, if you chose to do so, convert Liberty Media and the new Liberty Capital into asset-backed securities? Thank you. Gregory Maffei Jason, there are a bunch of issues around that, how we did that. The most important of which is obviously ensuring that there’s continuity on all sides so that if there were hard spins, then those became asset-backed. If they were five-year triggered or businesses that we’ve owned, substantially owned in their entirety for five years on all of those, and I’m not sure, candidly, right now if we would qualify for that, but there’s judgments in all of those. Jason Bazinet - Citi  And does that have to include Liberty Interactive? Gregory Maffei If you’re asking, could we imagine a scenario where we just spun Liberty Entertainment away on its own? Jason Bazinet - Citi  Correct. Gregory Maffei That’s certainly a doable scenario. Not necessarily suggesting it’s one we plan on doing. There’s no reason you can’t spin one of the three hard. Jason Bazinet - Citi  Okay. Thank you. Operator We’ll move now to Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank  Just one question for Greg. So, the current Liberty Capital stock price still reflects a pretty large discount to asset value despite anticipation of the entertainment tracker next week… Gregory Maffei Arguably massive. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank  Arguably massive. So, while I know, there’s always going to be a lot of moving parts, but if Dr. Malone charged you with raising as much cash as possible at Liberty Capital and at Liberty Entertainment to repurchase shares, could you just walk us through the potential sources of cash in each of those trackers? I know it’s attribution, but in each of those trackers? Gregory Maffei Liberty Entertainment has attributed to it $550 million of exchangeable debt which is long term. It needs to be serviced, but it’s probably not a current issue about trying to handle the maturity. It has roughly $1 billion dollars of cash. You could imagine coming up with some sort of a Reg U loan, probably not anywhere near the maximum of what a Reg U loan could do against the DirecTV stock at Liberty Entertainment, but that is a source of capital. But I would heavily discount, it’s not certainly a 50% source of capital.  And the second is, what borrowings we could generate against Starz Entertainment, which has a healthy cash flow and certainly could generate some capital in this marketplace, less than in some, but still we’re comfortable if we needed to borrow against Liberty Entertainment.  There’s at least those two sources, as well as its own cash. Liberty Capital will also come out with a substantial cash load, just shy of $2 billion, and it will have borrowing capacity really only against the derivatives that are in there.  There are no operating businesses that probably generate substantial amounts. You can maybe get a little out of the Braves, given the major league facilities that they have in place, et cetera, but they’re not substantial. The big one would be borrowing its derivatives, and that could also be several billion dollars, depending on the conditions, maybe up to two. Doug, just to be clear, I should not leave that comment without noting, we have never been very enthusiastic about borrowing against those kind of positions when you don’t have takeouts and liquidity or taxable exits. Why we felt better about borrowing against Liberty Interactive is, you have a cash flow generating business that can repay the debt.  Theoretically, you don’t have to sell an asset, potentially pay taxes, to repay the debt. So, if you took that metric, you’re really left with only the cash at Liberty Capital and you’re left with only the cash and the borrowing capacity against Starz at Liberty Entertainment and that would substantially reduce your borrowings. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank  And one other source of cash could be if DirecTV paid a dividend. Gregory Maffei If any operating business that we own a piece of pays a dividend we would receive our pro rata share. We are a substantial holder at DirecTV and we talked about their ability to potentially have more leverage, but it’s not something certainly we can dictate. We’d like to think that we’ll have positive dialog and influence, but they have a Board that of which we will be a minority, and they have obligations to all their shareholders. Operator Our next question today comes from Jeff Seidel - Acuity Asset Management. Jeff Seidel - Acuity Asset Management  I just wanted to circle back on the Liberty Time Warner exchangeable for a moment. Just back in the envelope, looking at it here, we think that the day past the put date, the value of the bond will drop below par, at least the fair value of the bond would drop below par, which would probably induce most holders of the convertible debt to put them later in March.  I just wanted to get your thoughts, perhaps strategically in terms of the hedge, I think the convertible bond is the hedge for the Time Warner piece, the put would leave you long Time Warner shares that underlie that entire bond.  And in addition, I would just like to understand how you think strategically about the exchangeable debt in light of some of the recent IRS challenges to the tax features that are embedded in, I think, all of those exchangeables. Thank you. Gregory Maffei So, you know, we will see where the marketplace takes the debt, and whether it’s put, I think I mentioned already our expectation is that we would settle in cash. W e would then be long some amount, either ranging from $1 dollar to a $1.7 billion, if you took it to the max, $1.6 billion something of Time Warner stock. And we would consider at the time whether we thought Time Warner stock was undervalued, fully valued, a good source of liquidity if we needed liquidity in lieu of debt. We are not obligated to go out and find a source of liquidity, because for handling that, we really have three sources of liquidity: the cash on the balance sheet that is already in new Liberty Capital; the borrowings that we could bridge either temporarily against the Sprint position and the Motorola position, those derivatives that we talked about earlier; and the potential to do a longer term facility if we so chose against the Time Warner, then would be free and clear Time Warner stock.  And our understanding, and we’ve done a little bit of homework because the convert market is pretty good, and the opportunities for us to refinance are pretty good if we so chose, and I think we’d weigh that at the time. As far as any IRS issues, and what that does, I think we’re very comfortable with where we’re going on that, and I don’t think that will be a factor in our decision making. Operator We’ll move now to April Horace - Janco Partners. April Horace - Janco Partners  I was wondering, DTV has said now that the transaction has been closed, that they were going to address their balance sheet expeditiously and I was wondering if you had anything in mind as to what he might have meant or could expand on that, as well as now that Time Warner Inc. is talking about breaking up, does that speed up the urgency to potentially change or expedite a transaction with Time Warner? Gregory Maffei I’m sorry, April, I’ll answer the first one, and then you can repeat the first part of the second one because I missed that. No, I think I only heard secondhand, I didn’t listen to the entire investor presentation with Chase and his team, but I understand, they’re going to move on it expeditiously, and we will hopefully be part of that dialog. We literally joined the Board yesterday. Neither Dr. Malone nor I have been to any Board meetings. We’re hoping to be joined by a third colleague on the Board in due process. So, I think on the normal Board cycle, we’ll talk about alternatives and hopefully we’ll be a positive voice in that discussion.  You asked something about what changes with Time Warner and I’m afraid I didn’t catch the first part. April Horace - Janco Partners  Yes, I apologize. Time Warner, Inc. is talking about breaking themselves up, and I think they were talking about spinning out Time Warner Cable. They’ve also talked about maybe breaking up AOL into two pieces and I was wondering if you had stepped up conversations with Time Warner Inc. so that you don’t find yourself in the same kind of position with IACI? Gregory Maffei I’m not sure those are exactly comparable positions, but because of those exchangeables that we talked about earlier, we’re enthusiastic in having the Time Warner stock go up. So, we’re all for that. So, any of these restructuring actions announced or planned or discussed restructuring actions that they take that have a positive impact on the stock, we’re all for it. Secondarily, we and Time Warner went through a very difficult process and difficult in the sense that it was harder to navigate between baseball’s rules, the IRS’s rules, our desires and their desires, got through it, and would love to find a way, I think both parties, to do another transaction for an asset if they were sellers and we were buyers. Because I think we could work well through that.  So, as they do that process, if there are things that they do sell, which would be attractive, and we could do another 355 exchange that would generate cash and/or an attractive asset, tax-free to both parties, allow it to get out of our Time Warner stock in a tax efficient manner, that’s a positive for both parties and something that we have had preliminary dialog about ideas but nothing substantive today.  And so, I don’t think anything else changes given the restructuring other than perhaps helping us with our exchangeables and maybe freeing up more assets. Operator We have time for one last question. We will move now to Victor Anthony - Bear Stearns.   Victor Anthony - Bear Stearns Just had two quick questions. One, your e-commerce acquisitions have been rather diverse. Wonder if you could give us a sense of your e-commerce M&A strategy, for example, what verticals are you targeting, the size of the acquisitions, et cetera, and how are you leveraging those acquisitions across each other at QVC?  And second, I was wondering if there was anything that actually prevents you, maybe some tax issues, from converting LINTA back into Liberty Capital stock, considering where the share price performance over the past two months. Simply I just wanted to know whether or not that’s crossed your mind. Thanks. Gregory Maffei So, on e-commerce M&A, I think we’ve talked to some degree about this in the past at our Investor Day and the like. There are a couple of strategies here. First and foremost, to find attractive businesses with good growth prospects, good protection, the so-called Warren Buffett moat, have good growth characteristics, as I mentioned, with strong management teams, and are attractively valued and priced given their growth prospects on a standalone basis. And I think we found that in most of those businesses and most are performing well. In addition, we think there are some synergies that run both across those e-commerce businesses in terms of not only cross promotion and sharing best practices around things like paid and natural search but around content strategies, around procurement, around a host of other areas where those teams are working together.  And frankly, there are things that Backcountry has done, for example, with being a trusted voice, which is a powerful influence against, perhaps, what Bodybuilder can do given its strength with body space and content that can be shared well across with Provide being more of a content site for Flowers, and Provide’s strength in understanding how to attract customers, and they are very sophisticated at customer acquisition costs, can be shared across the others. So there’s really been some good synergies and I think that’s a positive for all of them. The other synergy we look for is one where we can see video promotion or the potential promotion from not only QVC.com but the linear TV site, QVC. And we’ve had some success at that, first and foremost, with Provide. We’ve fiddled with the formula and I think have been doing better recently.  So, while that is not the basis alone on which we buy these businesses, that’s the second set of upside. And we really look for that probably more at ProFlowers in certain times of the year, for example, or BUYSEASONS, which has also been promoted at QVC, the costumes aspect, than probably for Backcountry, which is more of an outdoors sale and not necessarily as logical fit with the QVC audience. So, that’s kind of where we’re going. As far as verticals we’re fairly wide open. Our first choice would be one that we thought could be promoted on QVC, but we’re certainly not going to be limited by that. As far as size, I think anything from $50 million to $5 billion. That having been said, while that sounds like an enormous range, if you start looking at how many attractive, independent, standalone, e-commerce businesses on reasonable valuations there are that fit that criteria, the field narrows quickly.  So, as I said, we’ve done four, one that was actually done just before we did the spin or rather the creation of the tracker for LINTA. And still 90% of our cash flow has gone to share repurchase, not acquisition, excluding that first one. As far as bringing LINTA back in, I don’t know why we would bring LINTA into new LCAPA. New LCAPA, as I said, the rump of what’s left, the pieces that frankly are less strategic, that are harder to unwind, and that’s going to be a long-term project that will keep people here occupied for a while.  We’re hoping to get more clarity, more focus, stronger operating businesses that are logical and fit together at Liberty Interactive, and the same at Liberty Entertainment. So, it would sort of be counter to our strategy, I don’t think it would be positive for either of those stocks to be merging it back in. So, I don’t see that as our current plan. Of course, things could change, but that’s not where we’re headed today. Gregory B. Maffei So, operator, that’s it, so I want to thank everybody for joining us today, and for your interest in Liberty Media, and we’ll look forward to seeing you again soon or on the next call.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Our first question today comes from Kit Spring - Stifel. Kit Spring - Stifel  Could you talk about what assets you might potentially want out of Sprint, Motorola or Time Warner, and which of those you think are most likely? And then maybe also talk a little bit about the value of the derivatives hedging those positions; if there have been any changes that you can discuss? Thanks. Gregory Maffei Because there surely will be confusion. All of those positions and all of those derivatives will be in new Liberty Capital, and all of those positions are hedged to some degree or other. So, looking at what’s in Sprint that might be interesting, we’ve had some preliminary discussions, mostly, frankly, with the old management team at Sprint, not too much with the new.  They understandably might not look at us as their first priority, settling out with what we want to do. They’ve got other challenges, which we understand, and there are certainly some spectrum assets or some, perhaps, the long distance fiber business, which would be worth talking about.  Are they highly strategic to us? No, that’s part of the reason why this is a Liberty Capital deal, and you’d have to figure that out whether they would actually qualify as a good operating business, for the example in the case of some of the spectrum. So on Motorola, had very limited conversations with Motorola about some kinds of swaps, very limited, and really, that’s harder to see, just because they’re not a company that has been selling a lot of businesses, and I guess that potentially could change. There’s talk of change at Motorola, we’ll see. Time Warner, in some ways, it’s a company we’ve already done one transaction with and a company that is likely a seller or potentially a seller of businesses, and we being able to offer them tax-free transactions, I would think that’s the one where you would have the highest likelihood.  And while nothing is imminent, you could imagine they being a seller of assets that we might like, and frankly might understand better or might be able to run better, given the media characterization and nature of them, than other businesses that are out there, for example, than a Motorola would probably be a more technology-oriented business.  Neal Dermer, Vice President of Finance, do you want to make some general comments about what’s happened to the derivatives? Neal Dermer They’ve gone up in value as the stocks have gone down, so that’s really the only change there’s been, other than some positions expiring. Operator We’ll hear next from Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley  Since we’re effectively talking, I think, about three trackers, I’ll ask three questions, one for each so each one gets some attention. Maybe, Mike, on QVC, just to give us a sense for the exposure on the jewelry side and what’s happening with commodity prices, particularly gold, this continues to be an issue every quarter. Could you put into context maybe how big the jewelry business is in each of your big markets, and what the gross margin differential is so we can understand that mix shift trend over time going forward? And then, Greg, at RevCo, you’ve got a Time Warner call put in the next couple months. What do you want to do with that position? Do you want to go effectively naked long? I don’t think there’s a hedge on that stock at all anymore, or at least not on the majority of it. Any thoughts on what you want to do with the Time Warner position?  And then last but not least, on LMDIA with DirecTV, do you think it creates value at that tracker to consolidate the DirecTV business? Is that something that you believe investors will look at as a consolidated asset and assign less of a discount? Michael George I won’t get into real specific numbers on the jewelry mix, but I’ll try to frame it. So, jewelry as a general statement across our markets typically runs as a percent of the total business in the low 20s percent, although gold, as a portion of jewelry, is going to be maybe 25%, let’s say, of the jewelry business.  So, when you just focus on gold, where we’re getting the biggest impact of the commodity increases, that’s just a portion of that 20%, 25% jewelry mix. Again I won’t reveal specific margins, the jewelry margin is a little bit higher than the company average as is the apparel margin. But also to put it in context, the jewelry business has been soft in the U.S., let’s say, flat to up 2%. It’s actually rebounded and was positive in the U.K. and was positive in Japan; positive meaning growing as fast or faster than the base business. Germany, it’s soft, and the U.S. it’s soft.  So, it’s soft in two of the four markets. It’s in the low 20s as a percent of the business, and it’s our goal, again, to try to maintain stable margins. So even with that softness, I’m not giving up on us being able to keep our margin rates fairly flat over time. What hurt us in Q4 was a little bit of a unique combination of particular weakness in jewelry and apparel and very high strength in consumer electronics, which is substantially lower margin than the rest of our businesses.  And it was really that combination that caused a big margin swing. Over a long period of time, we don’t anticipate that overall margins will decline in any material way due to the jewelry issue. Gregory Maffei Great. So, on the Time Warner exchangeables, for those who are not as aware, there’s an upcoming opportunity for the holders of that debt to put that debt to us. We recently, I think it was last week, issued a press release saying that if they did put that debt to us, we would intend to pay it off with cash rather than Time Warner stock or Liberty Media, one of our trackers, both alternatives which were available to us. I don’t anticipate that actually is going to get put to us, because based on where that debt is currently trading, given the strength of the convertible market and where the Time Warner stock is, unless things change dramatically, my understanding is the bonds are trading at well above par and more unlikely to get put, but if it gets put to us, we’re likely to sell it in cash and consider other ways to raise capital as needed, when needed, against the Time Warner stock.  Now, we today effectively are hedged against any run in the Time Warner stock because we have sufficient Time Warner stock to settle that issue if we choose in Time Warner stock, but we don’t choose to. On the DirecTV and Liberty Entertainment, LMDIA, what will we do there? I think that really will depend. We love the business, we have been, as I mentioned earlier, very impressed with the management team, their strategy and what is going on there.  It was fascinating to read The Wall Street Journal today suggest we had all these major challenges in front of us, when that was what was suggested pretty much 18 months ago or 15 months ago when it was first rumored and then struck and the business has performed, as I’ve mentioned already, far better than its peer group, better than the other major satellite player, better than any of the major cable players.  So, we’re very happy with where they’re going, and what we will do going forward will be dependent on price, and how we formulate and complete our strategy. So, I don’t think we’re ready to say that today, but we like the business, we’re enthused about it, and I think we’ll likely try and work with them more closely over time. Operator We’ll now move on to Andy Baker - Jefferies & Company. Andy Baker - Jefferies & Company  Just two questions. One for Bob, just a couple years ago you said you were going to get this business up to $275 million of operating cash flow and everyone stared at you with blank faces and, you did it now.  The question is, how does growth come going forward, now that arguably some of the easy lifting has been done and especially as you roll out more content that you’re creating yourself?  And then for Greg, forgive me, I’ve been out of the loop a little bit, but are you still standing by on the LINTA side, the long-term guidance of low double digit operating cash flow growth? Robert Clasen The answer, I think, comes in four or five different areas. First of all, we think we’ve just scratched the surface with what to do with digital work, both with our affiliates and with consumer electronics; the market certainly has jumped up around us, and we think that there is an opportunity for us, given especially the long-term movie deals that we have, to continue to look for ways to capitalize on that, the Internet and digital. The whole entrance into originals is also an opportunity to move the top line. As I said, this first project is a joint venture with Lions Gate. So, we’re not just licensing content anymore, we’re actually owning content, and we’re developing, of course, in Starz Media some of our own.  But from Liberty Entertainment’s perspective, this is a chance to use the content to sell overseas, to sell through our own home video company, have our own people at Media syndicate it, so we think that there are some synergies there. And we think that there is an opportunity in short form, and we’re doing a lot, looking at our own movie libraries, we’re looking at the Internet and we’re looking with our affiliates to see ways that in mobile, as well as on their own affiliate web site, the ways that we should provide content for them that’s this short form that lets us generate some revenue.  So, it’s around the edges; we have a gigantic, reasonably stable business, and now it’s a matter of looking outside the core to these other opportunities. Andy Baker - Jefferies & Company  And does this pressure the cost side? Robert Clasen On the cost side, we expect that we’re going to be more efficient buyers over time of content. Both Sony and Disney, wisely for them, extended their agreements last year, and I think it’s four and five years from now that they still have content coming to us under those old agreements.  We think that as we look to the market today, we’d like other content put around that at 40% and 50% and 60% less than we would have been paying even three and four years ago. Gregory Maffei One way to look at this is we are having a very positive tailwind of reduced costs in programming, largely driven by declining prices of films. And in fact, our level is artificially high for a period because of those long-term contracts we have with Sony and Disney. So, there’s actually pent-up further decline based on when those move to a larger market rate or a more market rate.  And what Bob and his team are doing is reinvesting a portion, a relatively small portion of that programming (inaudible) and that programming budget in more originals and more ways to reach (inaudible) for the channel and the properties overall, and we think it’s a great strategy. Robert Clasen Another point about the cost side is that about 10% of the new output movies, which is the bulk of our expense, we’re now buying from ourselves through Overture films. Gregory Maffei And, Andy, on the second part, do we stand by the long-term growth rate for LINTA? Yes. But I’ll embellish a teeny bit. Obviously the largest variable there has been QVC. QVC looks like a wave cycle in terms of its growth.  If you look back 4 years ago, it was 4%, then it was 8%, then it was 12%, then it was 8%, and where it looks like we’re obviously in a down year on 2007 against that, but we have no reason to believe fundamentally there is variation in the long-term growth rate, that it’ll be cyclical, it will move around, that’s why we don’t give quarterly guidance or even annual guidance, but we’re comfortable with that long-term rate. Andy Baker - Jefferies & Company  When can you get back in the market now that you’ve reported results for buying stock at LINTA? Gregory Maffei I don’t believe we actually make public our trade windows. Operator Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet - Citi. Jason Bazinet - Citi  I was wondering if you could just remind us of the flexibility and the mechanism by which you would, if you chose to do so, convert Liberty Media and the new Liberty Capital into asset-backed securities? Thank you. Gregory Maffei Jason, there are a bunch of issues around that, how we did that. The most important of which is obviously ensuring that there’s continuity on all sides so that if there were hard spins, then those became asset-backed. If they were five-year triggered or businesses that we’ve owned, substantially owned in their entirety for five years on all of those, and I’m not sure, candidly, right now if we would qualify for that, but there’s judgments in all of those. Jason Bazinet - Citi  And does that have to include Liberty Interactive? Gregory Maffei If you’re asking, could we imagine a scenario where we just spun Liberty Entertainment away on its own? Jason Bazinet - Citi  Correct. Gregory Maffei That’s certainly a doable scenario. Not necessarily suggesting it’s one we plan on doing. There’s no reason you can’t spin one of the three hard. Jason Bazinet - Citi  Okay. Thank you. Operator We’ll move now to Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank  Just one question for Greg. So, the current Liberty Capital stock price still reflects a pretty large discount to asset value despite anticipation of the entertainment tracker next week… Gregory Maffei Arguably massive. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank  Arguably massive. So, while I know, there’s always going to be a lot of moving parts, but if Dr. Malone charged you with raising as much cash as possible at Liberty Capital and at Liberty Entertainment to repurchase shares, could you just walk us through the potential sources of cash in each of those trackers? I know it’s attribution, but in each of those trackers? Gregory Maffei Liberty Entertainment has attributed to it $550 million of exchangeable debt which is long term. It needs to be serviced, but it’s probably not a current issue about trying to handle the maturity. It has roughly $1 billion dollars of cash. You could imagine coming up with some sort of a Reg U loan, probably not anywhere near the maximum of what a Reg U loan could do against the DirecTV stock at Liberty Entertainment, but that is a source of capital. But I would heavily discount, it’s not certainly a 50% source of capital.  And the second is, what borrowings we could generate against Starz Entertainment, which has a healthy cash flow and certainly could generate some capital in this marketplace, less than in some, but still we’re comfortable if we needed to borrow against Liberty Entertainment.  There’s at least those two sources, as well as its own cash. Liberty Capital will also come out with a substantial cash load, just shy of $2 billion, and it will have borrowing capacity really only against the derivatives that are in there.  There are no operating businesses that probably generate substantial amounts. You can maybe get a little out of the Braves, given the major league facilities that they have in place, et cetera, but they’re not substantial. The big one would be borrowing its derivatives, and that could also be several billion dollars, depending on the conditions, maybe up to two. Doug, just to be clear, I should not leave that comment without noting, we have never been very enthusiastic about borrowing against those kind of positions when you don’t have takeouts and liquidity or taxable exits. Why we felt better about borrowing against Liberty Interactive is, you have a cash flow generating business that can repay the debt.  Theoretically, you don’t have to sell an asset, potentially pay taxes, to repay the debt. So, if you took that metric, you’re really left with only the cash at Liberty Capital and you’re left with only the cash and the borrowing capacity against Starz at Liberty Entertainment and that would substantially reduce your borrowings. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank  And one other source of cash could be if DirecTV paid a dividend. Gregory Maffei If any operating business that we own a piece of pays a dividend we would receive our pro rata share. We are a substantial holder at DirecTV and we talked about their ability to potentially have more leverage, but it’s not something certainly we can dictate. We’d like to think that we’ll have positive dialog and influence, but they have a Board that of which we will be a minority, and they have obligations to all their shareholders.

And I think we found that in most of those businesses and most are performing well. In addition, we think there are some synergies that run both across those e-commerce businesses in terms of not only cross promotion and sharing best practices around things like paid and natural search but around content strategies, around procurement, around a host of other areas where those teams are working together.  And frankly, there are things that Backcountry has done, for example, with being a trusted voice, which is a powerful influence against, perhaps, what Bodybuilder can do given its strength with body space and content that can be shared well across with Provide being more of a content site for Flowers, and Provide’s strength in understanding how to attract customers, and they are very sophisticated at customer acquisition costs, can be shared across the others. So there’s really been some good synergies and I think that’s a positive for all of them. The other synergy we look for is one where we can see video promotion or the potential promotion from not only QVC.com but the linear TV site, QVC. And we’ve had some success at that, first and foremost, with Provide. We’ve fiddled with the formula and I think have been doing better recently.  So, while that is not the basis alone on which we buy these businesses, that’s the second set of upside. And we really look for that probably more at ProFlowers in certain times of the year, for example, or BUYSEASONS, which has also been promoted at QVC, the costumes aspect, than probably for Backcountry, which is more of an outdoors sale and not necessarily as logical fit with the QVC audience. So, that’s kind of where we’re going. As far as verticals we’re fairly wide open. Our first choice would be one that we thought could be promoted on QVC, but we’re certainly not going to be limited by that. As far as size, I think anything from $50 million to $5 billion. That having been said, while that sounds like an enormous range, if you start looking at how many attractive, independent, standalone, e-commerce businesses on reasonable valuations there are that fit that criteria, the field narrows quickly.  So, as I said, we’ve done four, one that was actually done just before we did the spin or rather the creation of the tracker for LINTA. And still 90% of our cash flow has gone to share repurchase, not acquisition, excluding that first one. As far as bringing LINTA back in, I don’t know why we would bring LINTA into new LCAPA. New LCAPA, as I said, the rump of what’s left, the pieces that frankly are less strategic, that are harder to unwind, and that’s going to be a long-term project that will keep people here occupied for a while.  We’re hoping to get more clarity, more focus, stronger operating businesses that are logical and fit together at Liberty Interactive, and the same at Liberty Entertainment. So, it would sort of be counter to our strategy, I don’t think it would be positive for either of those stocks to be merging it back in. So, I don’t see that as our current plan. Of course, things could change, but that’s not where we’re headed today. Gregory B. Maffei So, operator, that’s it, so I want to thank everybody for joining us today, and for your interest in Liberty Media, and we’ll look forward to seeing you again soon or on the next call.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Maffei. Please go ahead. Greg Maffei Thank you, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon and for your continued interest in Liberty. These have been exciting times at Liberty and we are quite pleased with some of the operational and structural progress we have made. There is still lot left to do, but I might talk a little bit about, first about how we are doing by tracker this quarter, discuss some of our operating performance at our businesses that we control and cover some of the transactions we did and other developments. Liberty\'s fine Controller, Mr. Chris Shean will discuss our attributed businesses, financial results and the liquidity picture for each of those trackers. QVC CEO, Mike George, will discuss recent development in QVC, Starz CEO; Bob Clasen will review recent events of Starz. Also on the call we have QVC’s CFO, Dan O’Connell, Starz’s, President and COO Bill Meyers, and EVP and CFO Glenn Curtis and several other Senior Liberty Executives. All of us will be available to answer questions at the end of the prepared remarks. Before we discuss the specific results of the quarter, I will review a couple of highlights and how they tied to our overall chain strategy and direction. Obviously, the most important news for the quarter was that we closed the long awaited exchange with news. Obviously, we think this is the great deal for our shareholders. The value has increased significantly, since we announced the deal. We are probably up about $4.5 million on the swap, and we like the company so much more that post the swap, we have added another 78.3 million shares to our holdings, in a creative low-cost transaction. The collar and borrowing against the collar to purchase the shares. That transaction increased our ownership to about 48% of the company. And we are still working on the best path to unlock additional value there. We were very pleased, as I suspect you were, by yesterday\'s announcements at DIRECTV of the performance in the first quarter. They really had a stupendous quarter on virtually every metric. We are also pleased that yesterday DIRECTV announced they were going to increase their share buyback program to $3 billion. We have been working with them on that and we agreed that we would not tender or sell any shares into that purchase, and we would agree to hold our votes neutral at the current 48%. So, we are very supported by their actions I think it’s the best use for the balance sheet and great return of capital shareholders. We are also excited that our economic interest in the business will increase, if not our voting interest and nothing that they are doing we believe limits our future strategic options or theirs. Also this quarter we had some structural optimization in that, we reclassified Liberty Capital and issued the new Liberty Entertainment tracking stock, providing further refined investment choices and we believe increase flexibility and options for the company. New LMDIA is centered around our 48% stake in DIRECTV, but also includes Starz Entertainment, the three regional sports networks, our 100% interest in FUN Technologies, our 50% interest in GSN, and our roughly 33% interest in WildBlue. New Liberty Capital is going to be focused on reducing complexity there, continuing to simplify and continue to isolate the discount from pretax value. We think this tracker structure provides, as I said new options and flexibility for us, while preserving efficiencies among all the Liberty assets. We are disappointed still the LMDIA trade at a discount to what most analysts believe is a fair sum of the parts. Soon after we initiated trading in the stock the discount go to about 30%. We recently went on a road show visiting Boston, Baltimore, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco is next and that, and probably some of our actions in conjunction with increasing our stake had a positive benefit we would like to think. The discount is narrowed back to the mid-teens. At one point, it actually got to as low as maybe 12% that\'s probably now post the DIRECTV earnings and the recent increase in their share price and LMDIA is lack of mirroring that increase substantially, it\'s probably in the 15% to 17% range. We still are looking to increase that discount. We don\'t believe that discount is probably correct at that wide width, and we like to think that by decreasing, we continue to open up our options as well as providing the current return for our shareholders. We have also had a lot of success operationally this quarter. LINTA had mixed results at QVC, but we\'re still comfortable with the business fundamentals. The domestic market is difficult and our analysis shows, not surprisingly that in the state that are most affected by foreclosures and recession, our revenue growth is most challenged. But we did considerably better than most of our peer group and think we are making the right kind of progress. Internationally, we also made excellent progress in the quarter, where you really saw the beginning of turns in several areas, particularly in Japan and beginning in Germany and the perspective that we had local currency growth, which we hadn\'t had for a while and better yet growth in US dollars. The e-commerce business is performed excellently. We are very excited about those and excited about their prospects. We did reduce our purchase activity during the quarter and our shares and with that it speaks less probably to our fundamental view about the stock, than the realities of the capital markets. We have about $9 million maturity -- debt maturity in July of \'09 and we are trying to keep some dry firepower to make sure that we can handle that debt maturity. As the capital market is clear up, I think we will probably look for increase borrowings and a way to continue our progress at LINTA. LMDIA, literally all of the businesses performed very well. We had strong operating performance at the major asset there at QVC as I have discussed. We had continued success at Starz Entertainment, as Bob Clasen is going to talk about more Fun Technologies particularly at one of our subsidiary did very well and expanding its internet offerings, interactive offering as well. GSN continues to do well. We will talk about more during the questions and answers, but we continue to work on strategic alternatives there and hope to have some idea too. At Liberty Capital the reclassified Liberty Capital has all the assets that were previously in Liberty Capital that were not otherwise attributed to Liberty Entertainment. In the operating businesses Starz Media release several films and continue to focus on building original content for Starz Entertainment and other distribution vehicles. We modify the terms of our Time Warner Exchangeable debts to minimize the impact of the put that the holders had, and we are able to have about 72% of the issue or 71% stay outstanding. In at LCAPA, we are continue to work on long-term strategy, but the reality is that we are likely looking at the path to control liquidation not in the near-term, but over time to optimize the value there. So, with that let me turn over to Chris to talk first about the Liberty Interactive results Chris Shean - Senior Vice President and Controller Thanks, Greg. The slide you are looking at is a quick snapshot of first quarter revenue and operating cash flow performance. It shows that Liberty Interactive\'s attributed businesses picked up the pace of revenue and operating cash flow growth. QVC is the primary driver of performance among Liberty Interactive attributed assets and continues to operate in a challenging retail environment. Nonetheless, business managed 5% consolidated revenue growth and 3% operating cash flow gains, while this below the results QVC strives for but continuing with a disciplined approach in product selection and pricing, the business remained sound. On the international side, we were aided by foreign currency gains, but also saw progress in operations and believe the business is headed in right direction in all markets. I will talk a bit more about this shortly. Looking more closely at Liberty Interactive as just discussed Liberty’s business achieved 10% revenue growth while operating cash flow grew 5%. As I would discuss in a bit more detail in a moment, QVC\'s domestic revenue in OCF was largely flat in the quarter. Meanwhile, international businesses aided by the FX gains experienced improving performance with over 15% revenue growth in dollars and 10% OCF gains.  Liberty Interactive\'s other E-commerce businesses which include Provide Commerce, Backcountry, Bodybuilding and BuySeasons had strong financial results in the first quarter and continued to grow at a rapid pace. In the aggregate, the E-commerce businesses experienced revenue and operating cash flow growth of 113% and a 144% respectively, due to the acquisitions, largely due to the acquisitions of Backcountry in June and Bodybuilding in December of 2007. Revenue and operating cash flow growth of these businesses were 37% and 55% respectively, calculated on a Performa basis assuming the business were all consolidated at the beginning of \'07. As Greg, mentioned earlier, we significantly slowed our share repurchase pace in the quarter, as upcoming debt maturities, combined with uncertainty in the capital market, led us to conclude, that we should cease repurchases and maintain our current capital until we see more stability in the capital markets. During the quarter we repurchased 4.7 million shares for $83 million. Since inception of the LINTA share repurchase program, we have reacquired 16% of the shares outstanding. We continue to believe in share repurchases as a good means of enhancing shareholder value and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to cost effectively shrink Liberty Interactive\'s equity. QVC experienced consolidated revenue growth of 5% to $1.77 billion during the quarter while OCF grew 3% to $387 million. Revenue growth, while somewhat slow by QVC standards was achieved with our promotional efforts. Consolidated OCF margins dipped by 30 basis points during the quarter resulting in OCF growth slightly lagging revenue growth. OCF margin declines were primarily the result of lower gross margins experienced across most product categories. Domestic revenue was flat for the quarter at $1.18 billion as the mix of products sold shifted from home to the jewelry and accessories areas. The average selling price increased 4% from $46.04 to $48.09, while total units shipped declined to $26.9 million from $27.8 million. Domestic OCF increased 1% in the first quarter to $281 million while the operating cash flow margin increased 20 basis points to 23.9% primarily due to lower fixed cost partially offset by decline in gross margins. QVC.com sales continued to grow as a percentage of overall domestic sales, rising from 23% in Q1 of \'07 to 24% this quarter. International revenue increased 15% to 589 million from the quarter, while OCF grew 10% to $106 million. Revenue growth was due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates, greater sales to existing subscribers in Germany and subscriber growth in the UK and Japan. OCF growth lagged that of revenue as OCF margins decline 80 basis points primarily due to lower gross margins and higher commission expense as a percentage of net revenue, due to new fixed rate agreement in the UK and Japan. Excluding the effect of exchange rates, International revenue increased 5% for the quarter, while OCF was largely flat. As was mentioned earlier, QVC\'s International operations appear to be making progress towards returning to prior performing levels. QVC UK continued its strong local currency performances as revenue increased 11% on an equal growth in units, while operating cash flow was up 6%. In Japan, QVC experienced 4% local currency revenue growth, the first top-line growth it\'s experience since the first quarter of 2007. While the change in the enforcement of the health and beauty regulations in Japan dampened growth over the past year, management has done an effective job of changing the product mix and creating productivity gains in alternative, product categories in what remains a strong market. In the aggregate, over the past two years even with the change regulations, QVC Japan experienced 10% top-line growth in the first quarter. In Germany, our operations have faced significant operational challenges over the past years. However, for the first time in a year, QVC Germany experienced local currency (Inaudible) this quarter on ASP and unit growth, while operating costs improved to partially offset the decline in gross margins. Management remains focused on completing the turnaround of this business. Now I hand it over to Michael George for additional QVC comments. Mike George Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned in the US we were truly disappointed with our sales results. We saw fairly broad weakness across most of our product categories. And we remain very focused on bringing our customers fresh and innovative product offerings that will capture their attention in a tough climate and overcome the overall weakness in consumer spending. We are finding that while the customers are being more selective right now, she will respond for new unique exclusive items. And so our focus is on trying to do a better job everyday of delivering those kinds of items to our customer. When we do, she does respond. Along those lines we did premiere several new plans in the quarter with good initial results, including new beauty brand Clinique and Kate Someville, Sony VAIO computers, Lucky brand hand bags, London Fog outerwear and a new bedding line by Whoopi Goldberg. We also expanded our product offerings in categories like big screen TV\'s and treadmills by developing some new shipping alternatives to lower the end cost to the customers. And we have number of strong brand launches coming later in the year, lot of them we can\'t comment on publicly this point but some that we have announced includes Steven Madden which premiered this week, Clinton Kelly and Martha Stewart Crafts. We are also focused at the same time on continuing our work to build the QVC brand and increase QVC\'s visibility through other media. In Q1 we are one of the featured cast on celebrity \'"Apprentice" and we ware featured extensively on our week long "Wheel of Fortune" series. So you are going to see us continue to expand these kind of media partnerships to find new ways to draw eyeballs to channel. We also began, as we have announced our broadcasting a second signal in high-definition at the end of Q1. And we are currently in discussion with our major affiliates partners about picking up the signal and carrying second HD location for QVC. And as Chris mentioned, despite the sales weakness, we were pleased with our ability to maintain stable gross margin in a tough environment and reduced our fix cost and controlled our variable expenses. All of which resulted in slight improvement in our OCF margin. We are also excited to welcome Clara Watts to her new role as President of U.S Commerce. And Clara, who has a wealth of experience in retailing across a number of formats, had joined us in February and on May 1st, resumed responsibility for our US Merchandising, Planning, Broadcast and Internet Activities. Also QVC this week, as Senior Vice President of Fashion, Jewelry and Beauty, is Jeff [Qureshi], a terrific merchant with deep experience in electronic retailing to QVC and as vendor of QVC and also someone who was at QVC a number of years ago. So these two strong additions complement, what we think is a terrific team of seasoned QVC executives. Together they are very focused on continuing to build the QVC brand experience and expand our customer base, as we upgrade our product and programming.  Turning now to our international businesses, we did see improved sales results across all of our markets. The UK delivered another good quarter, with particular strength in apparel, electronics and also jewelry, which had been a challenge for them last year. OCF margins however were impacted somewhat by the mix shift to electronics and also by the cost associated with our long-term extension of our preview, [DTT] contract. So, we are delighted to have the extension, but it did result in some increase cost that we will anniversary over the course of this year. Germany did show a modest improvement in performance, as Chris said posting positive sales in local currency for the first time in a year. We saw a good progress on every element of the turnaround program that we established last year. We increased the mix of business at regular pricing. We added a record number of successful of new show concepts to diversify the calendar and we managed expenses tightly. And despite these positive steps, we are clearly still fall in short of our sales goals and continue to be especially challenged in apparel and jewelry. So, fixing those businesses and getting Germany on a sustained path of higher sales growth is obviously a strong remaining priority. In Japan, we felt very good about the progress, we are making offset in the regulatory issues and help beauty and fitness. We grow strong double-digit sales gains in apparel, accessories and jewelry and also achieved our first positive sales growth in that market since Q1 of last year, when the regulations first hit us. So, we feel very good about it and feel that we are on the turnaround plan that we shared with all of you several months ago. We also expanded our distribution, our carriage by launching on the BS digital platform in December. We think that\'s going to be a great platform for us over time. Although it did -- there are additional cost associated with that, which dampened our OCF rate somewhat and that we will anniversary as we go through the course of this year. And then, I will turn it back to Chris. Chris Shean Thanks Mike. Let\'s take a quick look at the Liberty Interactive liquidity picture. We continue to maintain a strong capital structure and good liquidity as the businesses that are attributed the Liberty Interactive. The group has attributed cash and public investment of $4 billion and has $7.7 billion in attributed debt. Excluding the value of the positions in Expedia and IAC, LINTA\'s quarter ending attributed net debt of just over $7 billion equates a multiple at the very low end of our targeted leverage ratio of four to five times OCF. We are likely to maintain a level at the low end of this range until we see stronger capital markets, which would offer more readily accessible capital to us. Then moving on to Liberty Entertainment. The next two slides address our new tracking stock, which I may refer to as LMDIA during this time. The completion of our exchange with News Corp allowed for the reclassification of the old Liberty capital and the issuance of a new Liberty Entertainment tracking stock. Liberty Entertainment Groups operating results are comprised of Starz Entertainment, FUN Technologies and Liberty Sports Group. Attributed revenue grew 11% in the first quarter, while OCF was up 17%. Revenue and operating cash flow growth resulted from modest growth at Starz Entertainment, coupled with the inclusion of Liberty Sports Group. Now taking a closer look at Liberty Entertainment’s principal consolidated subsidiary, Starz Entertainment, it had another solid quarter of subscriber growth as Starz\'s average subscribers increased 6%, while Encore grew 12%. This subscriber growth was partially mitigated by Starz fixed rate affiliation agreements, which on a combined basis drove 3% revenue growth for the quarter. Starz operating cash flow growth of 1% slightly lagged revenue growth, as operating expenses increased 4% due to increased marketing expenses associated with new Straz with Straz\'s new branding campaign. Programming expenses were flat at lower bonus payment amortization was offset by higher effective rate for the movie titles exhibited in the first quarter. 2008 programming expenses are expected to be comparable to 2007 levels as Starz continues to invest in original programming initiatives with launch of its series Crash, Head Case and Hollywood Residential. Now let\'s take a look at the LMDIA liquidity picture. The business is attributed here are in a position of financial strength. At quarter end LMDIA was attributed with approximately $11.7 billion of public investment. In addition to its public (Inaudible) Liberty Entertainment had attributed cash and liquid investments of just under $1 billion at quarter end. Total cash in public holding approximated $12.6 billion well in excess of the $605 million space amount of attribute debt. Subsequent to quarterly end we purchased an additional 78.3 million DIRECTV shares in front of the purchase by borrowing just under $2 billion against a newly initiated equity collar on 10 million DIRECTV shares. This purchase increased our public holdings and debt equally by $2 billion. Before, we turn to Liberty Capital. I will next turn it over to Rob Clasen, who would like to say a few words about the exciting activity that Starz Entertainment and Starz Media. Rob Clasen Thanks, Chris. We continue to be pleased with the progress at Starz Entertainment, where subscriber growth continues at a fast pace, now several quarters in a row. As Chris said, cash flow remained flat versus a year ago, as we invested in our new Starz branding campaign and our new original series Head Case and Hollywood Residential. On the Starz Media side many of the initiatives, we launched last year in both theatrical and television programming began to bear first fruits. And speaking of first, we marked several first during the first quarter. Among them, over to films released its first theatrical motions pictures starting with Mad Money in January, which performed well at the box office, and will be a strong performer in home video starting this month in our premium channels later this year. Mad Money is the first example of our audience aggregation strategy because it will generate across multiple platforms. Theatrical, Home Video, Premium Television, Internet and Broadcast Syndication, all through our own in-house distribution businesses. Overture also released The Visitor, which is the best reviewed movie of the year so far, and rolls out to dozen more screen this month. At Starz Media we began our first collaboration on a television movie with videogame giant Electronic Arts Inc. At Starz Entertainment, we launched our first major branding campaign in six years including a strong new logo. We premiered our first comedy series and announced plans to air this fall our first original drama series Crash, based on the Academy Award-winning Best Picture. On the ratings front, for the first time ever, Starz in February finished first among premium channels and the Nielsen ratings will be a total day and prime-time, while Encore continues to rank first among premium channels in terms of subscriber count. As you know recently Viacom, Paramount, MGM and Lions Gate announced plans to launch a new premium television service late next year. Although the initial impact of this venture will be the deprive Showtime of its major first-run movie suppliers, we do not take lightly the possibility that it will provide a competitive challenge to us in the coming years. We intend to press on vigorously the value of our product both to our affiliates and to our subscribers. We will point out that our ratings in subscriber growth continued to be strong and that are investment in original programming in Overture Films will provide us two new sources of programming going forward, that Starz has contracts with our major studio partners, Disney and Sony that extend well into the next decade as well as library deals with Paramount and MGM for exclusive pay TV showings and that we continue to be able to purchase independent films in the open market at attractive prices. I\'ll now hand it back to Chris. Chris Shean Thanks Bob. The next set of slides addresses the new Liberty Capital tracking stock group. Upon their reclassification of the old Liberty Capital and the issuance of the Liberty Entertainment tracking stock, the new Liberty Capital was issued. This groups results includes Starz Media, the Atlanta Braves, TruePosition, Leisure Arts and our Green Bay market television stations WFRV. During the quarter, Liberty Capital revenue increased 26% to $91 million, while LCAPA\'s operating cash flow loss increased to $59 million. Now LCAPA\'s revenue growth was due to the inclusion of the Atlanta Braves, Leisure Arts and WFRV. The operating cash flow loss was primarily due to Starz Media and the seasonality of the Atlanta Braves, which doesn\'t really get started with their season until the second quarter. Now let\'s take a look at the LCAPA liquidity picture. The new Liberty Capital Group has attributed cash and public investments of $6.8 billion, and attributed debt 4.9 billion. During the quarter, Liberty modified certain terms of its 0.75%, Time Warner exchangeable, senior debentures to induce holders to not exercise their one-time put rights. The modifications included differing Liberty\'s ability to redeem the debentures until April 5, 2013. Committing to pay holders in cash upon maturity or redemption, rather than in Time Warner stock and increasing the rate of interest to 3% and 8% after the March 30, 2008. As a result, Liberty limited the repurchase to $486.1 million of the total issue of 1.75 billion with the residual 1.26 billion debentures remaining outstanding albeit under the revised terms. This repurchase was funded with cash from an existing borrowing facility that we had in place on different [collars] With that said, I\'ll turn the call back over to Greg who will quickly recap the quarter. Greg Maffei Thanks Chris and thank you to Mike and Bob for the updates on your respected businesses. As mentioned before, we\'re excited about what\'s going on at Liberty and hope you are too. We remain very much focused on maximizing value to you, our shareholders through innovative financial transactions, looking for way to redeploy our capital, including share repurchase on an attractive basis. The most cost efficient financing are available in a tough market, managing our businesses and investments best within each tracking stock and supporting our management team to produce this best operating results possible. We think we accomplished a lot this quarter, there is lot more to do and the pace of activity should remain high. So thank you for listening and for your continued interest in Liberty Media. With that, I\'d like to open the call for questions. Operator, thank you. Question-and-Answer Session  Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question today comes from Kit Spring with Stifel Nicolaus. Kit Spring - Stifel Nicolaus Regarding your investment in DirecTV, how do you see the video-on-demand product evolving and do you see the need for a broadband partner there? Thanks. Greg Maffei Well, thank you for the question. I think the video-on-demand product is going to be quite interesting, it highlights the strength of DIRECTV around the total TV experience and I think the implementation that they have looks quite interesting in beta compared to some of the alternatives in the cable universe. I think the question of how video-on-demand and the broadband partnerships work, as you know we are a larger one about our role in broadband. I think we\'re excited about the partnerships we have in broadband not only with Verizon and Quest but also the opportunities that we\'ve looked at with people like Broadband of Powerline or the alternatives around things like Clearwire but that may not change. Continuing interest in seeing all of those many alternatives bloom or we are sort of in the Maoist school where a 1000 flowers bloom in broadband if that helps us that and so we are excited on how that works for our business overall and not just in video-on-demand and I think a lot of progress is being made there. Kit Spring - Stifel Nicolaus Thanks. Operator We will move to Imran Khan with JPMorgan. Imran Khan - JPMorgan Yes, hi. Thank you for taking questions. Two questions regarding QVC. And first and I was wondering if you can give us some sense how the QVC.com did this quarter. What percentage of your revenues came from QVC.com and how much it\'s up year-over-year basis? And second question is, can you give us some sense that inventory level trending in both in the US and International market? Thank you. Greg Maffei Imran, we did about 24% in the quarter. I think that\'s up about 23 or 22 last year. Mike? Mike George That\'s right. Its up from 23 last year. Roughly one point increase in penetration and are a 5% overall growth I believe. Greg Maffei And you want to talk about the inventories, Mike? Mike George Yeah. As a broad statements our inventories we think are in good shape. They creeped somewhat in Germany. As Germany, struggled with their sales velocity last year, the inventories ended up Q1 of this year to Q1 of last year up, a little bit higher than we would like. So we are focused on that. Our goal is to bring those inventories in line over the course of the year. Its not at a level that gives us a high concern. But, it\'s still higher than we would like. Other than that, we feel good about our inventory position in both the UK and US and we are also watching those very closely and erring on the conservative side in this environment. Our Japan business is primarily a consignment business so we don\'t have meaningful levels of inventory in Japan. Imran Khan - JPMorgan Right, thank you.  Greg Maffei Thank you. Operator Okay. Now from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Bazinet - Citi I think sometime last year maybe early this year there was an adverse IRS ruling regarding some of the tax deductibility of the non-cash interest related to your exchangeables, and I was just wondering if you could just summarize what that ruling was and then sort of a implication for cash that would flow from LINTA to LCAPA? Thank you. Greg Maffei Jason there was a ruling that we or resolution I\'d more accurately state with the IRS that we had last quarter that was quite the opposite. There have been some precedents out there from Comcast and others that we believe we are very happy with our result compared to theirs and I will let Albert Rosenthal, our tax expert, and Gloria speak for a moment about it. Albert Rosenthal Our settlement with the IRS, we basically agreed that we will be able to continue to deduct both the cash and the contingent interest with respect to most of our exchangeable debentures. On two of the series we get to deduct the cash interest but not the contingent interest, so that is the settlement going forward. Jason Bazinet - Citi And what was the point of the delineation between the two where you can balance or you can\'t on the contingent? Albert Rosenthal On the two of that we were issued post-issuance of certain proposed regulations by the IRS back in 2001. Jason Bazinet - Citi Okay. All right and then the net implication for roughly in terms of the cash that will flow from LINTA to LCAPA? Greg Maffei That is about 200 -- it goes LINTA and LCAPA and it\'s -- that\'s a 150 issues, I think it was the right number. We can confirm that offline for you. Jason Bazinet - Citi Okay Greg Maffei Just to just understand how that\'s work, so that…We are deducting because of the equity feature that\'s embedded in those exchangeable, and the market costs embedded because of that equity feature Jason Bazinet - Citi Yeah. Greg Maffei We are deducting at an exceedingly higher rate than the cash interest being paid. Jason Bazinet - Citi Yes. Greg Maffei So that is a -- lets say we\'re deducting at 9% versus paying a three roughly. Jason Bazinet - Citi Yes. Greg Maffei But that is really a loan from the government, because we are going to eventually have to recapture some of those pieces. The LINTA pays for that tax shield rather than paying the US government, in the interim pays LCAPA for that tax shield. Jason Bazinet - Citi Understood. Okay, thank you very much. Operator Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley has our new question. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley Thanks. Greg on the DIRECTV debt issue yesterday, is this leverage level sort of optimal from your perspective or is it a function of just the credit markets and you expect more as the markets go little bit easier to tap later through this year? And then if I can ask the question on the Starz business, the subscription growth, I think you said 6% at Starz and 12 at Encore, there is obviously a lot of going on behind that that leads to a revenue growth number much lower. Can you guys give us a little more color on how we should think about the fixed-rate contracts versus the variable-rate contracts? And what that trend looks like going out over the next couple of years, so we can get a better sense for what the organic long-term growth is in this business? Greg Maffei Well I\'ll comment briefly on the DTV debt and let Bob who can talk about Starz. I think if we were here about a year ago, you\'ll have to get in line with all the investment bankers who were throwing us proposals to lend us money at many, many multiple of what the current debt level is. I\'m not sure we would endorse what they were thinking then, and if the capital markets are constraining from imaging something to much higher than what DIRECTV is thinking right now. I think the optimal level is probably a little higher than the current, but not necessarily what people were thinking last spring and throwing at us -- while offering to throw us. Bob, you want to comment on that? Bob Clasen Yes. There are a number of moving pieces. Let me just summarize a couple of them and tell you the impact. Some of our affiliates have so called fixed deals, where there are for examples, steps and CPI adjustments for them acquiring and divesting of subscribers, those kinds of actions. And then there are of course, the consignment subscribers, which are more on a one-to-one basis. In addition, you have going on within this next situations, where sometimes we\'re accounting for revenue based on cash we receive, when we are between contracts and negotiation and until we get a settlement or reach some mutual agreement in various steps, its frankly I see a problems, hard to understand. Let me give you a simple example that’s easier to look at us on an annual basis because some of these deals drag on for a long period of time. We had transactions in the second and third quarter last year that if you normalize them over the first quarter, we would have compared to first quarter in \'07 had a 5% revenue growth and 11% cash flow growth. So, not helpful, but its easier to look at us over the period of several running quarters because there are so many pieces and often they are tied to our top five or six affiliates that have such a impact on our overall revenue. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley Okay. That is helpful, Bob. And maybe I guess one follow-up on the Paramount Showtime deal or non-deal. What your thoughts given, what you see at Starz in terms of movie cost and the difficulty, getting incremental carriage, and you have a relationship with Paramount any thoughts on working with them on this JV? Any partnership opportunities that just would love to hear your thoughts on their outlook? Bob Clasen Well, I think at this point, they have made their decision to move in their own direction and it will be interesting to see, if there are other partners blockbusters have been mentioned. I don\'t know what that role would be. The background would be either three existing pay companies all got founded by company\'s that had massive distribution Time Warner with HBO, Viacom was a major cable company, when they found at Showtime and Starz is in our growth of TCI. I do think that the challenge in the first instances is to what\'s the box office performance. We are find of saying, we can run a three year old movie and beat most original series, HBO to their credit with the Sopranos, and Sex and the City. They are two gigantic hits in 35 years. So, movies still, uncut movies. In their original screen version, still do drive premium category and yet the original self with branding and identification. Our view would be any new venture, whether it\'s this new one or any has to have massive distribution in order to be successful and I am just quoting, what most of you have been saying at $3, any $13 million to $15 million to cover your costs, relative to the estimates of where they were with Showtime so. I think it\'s going to be a challenge, all you need to couple big partners to step up and say they want to do that, and it will happen. To your final point, we do have, what we think are the best MGM and Paramount films under exclusive license for pay that go well in to the next decade, so you are not going to be seeing a lot of the favorites from Paramount and MGM showing up on the new channel out of their library at least. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley Thanks a lot. Operator Our next question comes from Andy Baker with Jefferies & Company. Andy Baker - Jefferies & Company Thanks a lot. Just two questions, one I guess now that you reduced the number of film, reduced the outstanding amount of the Time Warner exchangeables. There is probably about 27 if I\'m so I\'m extremely sorry about $27 million shares of Time Warner that are not so under the exchangeable. I\'m wondering if you plans to hedge those or maybe look for a transaction with Time Warner, where you can give us back and give one of their businesses and maybe looking to get rid of and then on the onto QVC I was wondering Mike you can talk little bit about the gross margin and may be it has some sort of trickling down a little bit not too much but little about little if there is any more granularity you can give us there and how we should think about that over the long-term? Greg Maffei On Time Warners exchangeable share we have little less than that that are free and clear, but we look to or always consider at 355 exchange with the company if that were available, and we have continuing dialog when I actually talked to Dick Parsons two days ago. I don\'t think there was anything on the horizon that will be obvious for us not to do that. I think we are we stayed un-hedged for that, partly because that effectively says we believe the stocks is pretty cheap. As you may recall, we did our deal last spring May, 16 that the stock was affectively by 21, so that was pretty good trade up and I think 16 is probably has some more room to run. The unhinging of the ,moment at least of the Microsoft, Yahoo deals probably will be a plus for AOLs and other stuff out there, so we\'ll take our chances for the moment on at least some piece of our Time Warner stock and we\'ll remain open to any interesting transactions with the company. We\'re talk about the QVC gross margin, Mike? Mike George Yes. And I think at a high level, we continue to view gross margins as -- we would see gross margins largely staying flat over time. So, while there have been some bumps recently, there is nothing that we\'re seeing that would make us feel that -- it kind of average gross margin level that we\'re typically run that will decline on a consistent basis over time. There have been some fairly discrete things that have happened in the gross margin line in the last 12 months. Most notably, the opening of major distribution center in Florence and another one in Japan and expansion in the UK and Germany, all of those -- the cost of those are our warehousing cost are in gross margin, and until your anniversary the opening of a big facility that\'s under utilize that the start you have a hit. So, that\'s sort of one-off issue. We clearly have had some product margin issues from quarter-to-quarter in different counties, particularly as we\'ve seen electronics grow in the mix in a couple of countries and jewelry decline in the mix. And the combination of those two has caused a modest shift in gross margins but I view those as things that will ebb and flow over time. I don\'t think it\'s any long-term trend in the business. And as you know, we continue to avoid a higher level of promotional activity. We don\'t think its looks like our business model or needed and so, net of all that as, we feel pretty good about our margin levels, and that we\'re not going to face some sort of sustain secular decline in margins. Andy Baker - Jefferies & Company Okay, thanks guys. Operator Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Thanks. Few questions to Greg. I will ask you one and other two together, so it seems like the Discovery spinoff is taking longer than expected. You\'ve got - you\'re really busy with Interactive Corp and DIRECTV to be able to finish the advanced (Inaudible) negotiations. I know this might not obviously be specifically you, but can you give us any update on, when we can expect the S4 filing on discover? Greg Maffei I\'m going to talk that question to our esteemed General Counsel, Charles Tanabe. Charles Tanabe Well, first of all, this is a [DAP], call, but I expect that we will be filing an S4 in the very near future. I don’t there are any issues remaining with respect to the roll up.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank And then, typically what four to six weeks at the SEC and then you get to go? Bob Clasen Yeah, I think that\'s a pretty good guess. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank All right, so Greg in your [wheelhouse] what was the rational behind the agreement with DIRECTV to fix your voting power at 48%, I mean it was nice for DIRECTV of force, but I\'m not sure how it helps Liberty? And then second, I suspect this is delicate subject, given tax regulations, but the lets take theoretical scenario by which you wanted to be able to merge LMDIA and DIRECTV. Let’s assume DIRECTV\'S Board will be receptive even if you are not able to discuss the transaction with them yet. What steps do you need to take at LMDIA, and how long do those steps take, before you can be in a position to begin those talks with DIRECTV? Greg Maffei So, on the first question about why we agreed to freeze our voting power, I think we have a very positive relationship with the DIRECTV independent Board Members and we thought it was in their interest and ours. We understand why they wouldn’t want to take an action that would push us into voting hard control. I think that will be a difficult for a Board to do that, so they were left with choices either being sub-optimal in the capital structure or paying a dividend. Choices which they didn\'t find preferable, and we probably didn\'t either because we had -- even though, we have may be some tax advantages relative to how that income might come in. We are still not a tax efficient to us, is a repurchase. So that was a highly controversial thing for us to internally hereto agree to hold our votes flat. And we like only more DIRECTV economic we are not as averse to that. One the second question of what would have to be done, to complete a merger. It really depends on what kind of a merger you are thinking of. Because you could imagine scenarios in which, we offered LMDIA a tracking stock to do -- rolled up DirecTV, and if that was acceptable to their holders. That will take a certain amount of time, first to get a deal and then to get it through the FCC and the like, to the degree that you, first because they didn\'t not want to receive tracking stock imagined, some kind of spin transaction. I think that probably will be a longer term time frame just in terms of getting a spin done. May be four to six months, I am not, it\'s not something we\'ve agreed to. We certainly thought about all of our options, but its not in our plan today. And if you then had a subsequent merger there would be some tax considerations around Morris Trust, which would ensure that -- would need to ensure that our shareholders who were, 51% of that combined vote and value on a go-forward basis. But if you look at the, assets in LMDIA including the 48% plus the other assets we have in there primarily Starz, the RSN etcetera less the net debt. I think that might be a reasonable scenario. It\'s unlikely we would combine in any scenario in which would be less than 51%. So, I don\'t think there is huge impediments to that. Its whether you could get the deal done is another matter. But there is no huge impediments on a tax basis. Just need more time involved with the spin. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Right thank you.  Greg Maffei Yeah. Operator We\'ll hear next from Evergreen Management and Chris Taylor. Chris Taylor - Evergreen Management Thanks, that was my question as well, so… Greg Maffei That we anticipated. Chris Taylor - Evergreen Management Thanks. Operator We move now to Lehman Brothers and Vijay Jayant. Vijay Jayant - Lehman Brothers Given the recent ruling on the litigation with IAC, can you sort of talk about what your options are now? Is there any chance obviously of doing anything before the spins? And also any comment on what may and may not be done with Expedia? Thanks. Greg Maffei I think there is a host of options that are imaginable, but potentially us working with them on the spins on some agreed form going forward potentially, we are still doing a 355 transaction or we, I believe also filed at that time to a potentially appeal if there are -- if they go forward on a basis we don\'t like. So all options remains open and that could involve a deal also on Expedia but with that I\'m not overly optimistic on that prospect. Vijay Jayant - Lehman Brothers As following up, I think QVC becomes a [five year trader] business in September or November of this year, so chance of LINTA being spun off, is that something even on the table? Greg Maffei That\'s not our current thinking and plans I mean in part because not to sound like we\'ve totally drunken the tracker Kool-Aid just for no reason. Partly because we don\'t know for example look down the road or think about an LMDIA spin because that\'s a more attractive way to combine with DirecTV. Again we have no current plans for that but we certainly consider that as an alternative out there and whether that might foreclose or cause you think differently about spending QVC or LMDIA, we\'ll watch and see. Vijay Jayant - Lehman Brothers Thanks. Operator We\'ll take our next question up from April Horace with Janco Partners. April Horace - Janco Partners Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Greg, I think you\'ve mentioned in the beginning of the call, something about a controlled liquidation of LCAPA. Could you expand on that? Greg Maffei Well, I think we believe that those exchangeables create lot of shield, at least on an interim basis, and if we\'re clever enough to figure out ways to get liquid on some of the investments in LMDIA -- excuse me, in LCAPA, on an tax efficient basis, we should be able to build some value there. The path is not clear. The obstacles are many and there is no near-term event or catalyst that\'s going to get us there. I do think over the long-term you are likely to be trying to get liquidity and or capture if you cannot capture some of the discount to this present value, some of the parts on pretax basis to the degree you can get the tax efficiently. But, that probably doesn\'t happen in the long-term -- in the short-term, rather it happens on a long-term basis. You\'re investing the capital that you have in assets to -- that hopefully out -- that out-earn what our liabilities are growing at. One point to note, we have to maintain a fair amount of liquidity at LCAPA. We can\'t, as some one might just look and say, why you got lot of cash and you have a relatively low market cap line. Why aren\'t you just buying the stock hand over fist? One of the challenges there, there are lot of our liabilities on the dead end, on the tax side, which could be accelerated in the events of third-party transactions over which we have no control. And so, we need to maintain a certain amount of liquidity if Sprint were sold or Motorola were sold tomorrow for cash, we need to maintain a certain amount of liquidity to ensure that we would be able to handle our obligations under that circumstance. So the face value of looking at it and saying, oh, there is obviously a huge discount and there is obviously enormous amount of cash, is not as clear once you start looking at what liabilities could be accelerated. So I go back to my statement about why if they control liquidation; I suspect it\'s a path where we\'re trying to get liquidity overtime, trying to reduce the size of the equity float, but it\'s probably something you chip at and you hope you can do well on that. There is no clear path up here. April Horace - Janco Partners And one point Dan, you mentioned that you might just some day bite the bullet and pay some tax, and I think that was probably more aimed at Motorola. Greg Maffei Well I don\'t thinks it as broad fit. That\'s certainly the case with 20/20 hindsight in which if we just sold an asset at some price and paid the tax it would have been better and that\'s only with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. So we will try and have more foresight and hopefully decide if there are cases where liquidating is better than holding out for better after-tax assumed value. April Horace - Janco Partners Okay great. That\'s all I\'ve got. Operator We\'ll take our next question from [Brian Lorraine] with First Capital Alliance. Brian Lorraine - First Capital Alliance My question was just answered. Greg Maffei We are knocking them down here. Operator We go next to David Gober with Morgan Stanley. Greg Maffei David you have a question. Operator Hearing no response we move on to Andrew Cole with JL Advisors. Andrew Cole - JL Advisors Hi. Why you were buying back any stock when you thought there was a discount if any. Just your thought processes there? Greg Maffei I am sorry. On which track Cole. Andrew Cole - JL Advisors On LMDIA. Liberty Media. Greg Maffei Yeah at LMDIA the reason why, we try and maintain liquidity there is. You sort of go back the way we think about Liberty Capital. Unlike Liberty Interactive where we have big earning asset called QVC. We have a relative corresponding smaller earning asset there and we actually now have a fair amount of debt given the transaction we did to increase our stake at DIRECTV and if we were purchase stocks in size, we would be adding to that debt with no clear way to settle, other than potentially selling of assets, all which have relatively low tax basis. And in some cases we are prohibited from selling and in other cases we think it\'s strategic to hold more.  So, until you see clear pass to get to, an earning asset. I mean if you do tomorrow you are going to merge with DirecTV. Yeah you\'d buy the heck of LMDIA because it\'s writing at a discount. But you don\'t know you are going to merge with DirecTV, you don\'t know you are going to have access their relatively larger cash flows to cover any debt that you put on. So until, we have a clear path about what the LMDIA future is, how we would settle that debt, we are probably unlikely to buy back in size. Andrew Cole - JL Advisors Okay. Thank you. Operator Our last question today comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen with Merrill Lynch Jessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch I have just two questions. I think you said on preview, that the cost -- well, you did say, the cost increased because you\'ve expanded your relationship. Can you just outline how much it was for the quarter and what we should expect for the year? And secondly with your increased stake in Interactive, could you discuss again, not in this call but again have you happen to pass? How possible or likely it is for you to acquire Home Shopping Network and if that is a possibility, what benefit there are to you since you have said in the past there were not a lot of cost savings? Thanks. Greg Maffei Mike, do you want to talk about the increased cost of carriage? Mike George Yes, the increased cost for Freeview was about a 127 basis points and we will anniversary that in the fourth quarter. Greg Maffei And on HSN, we remain open to a transaction it can be done at attractive price I think what the management team and Liberty have thought is if you look at the operating structures and we haven\'t done extensive due diligence on HSN, but if you look at the operating structures it isn\'t apparent that there is enormous cost synergies i.e. items you could knock out because -- it\'s like a accounts payable or accounts receivable or other G&A function. There is some amount but it\'s not huge. A large portion of what else\'s in there in the cost side relates to variable items that probably not be able to or fixed items will not be able to eliminate. You would need to have the two broadcaster facilities for example if you want to keep both present. The potential that seems less clear, but you would think given the relative $4.5 billion-ish revenue stream we had in the US and a $2 billion-ish revenue stream that they have in the US you would like to think you would find some synergies perhaps in purchasing, perhaps in counter programming, when we ran jewelry, they ran power tools or vice versa, so that you were not attacking the same audience. Those are harder to capture, harder to know. As I said we\'ve not done extensive due diligence internally on HSN. Mike, would you add anything. Mike George No. Nothing else to add. Greg Maffei So, that\'s it operator. I want to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Liberty Media. Operator And that concludes today\'s Liberty Media Corporation first quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for attending and have a good day.

Our first question today comes from Kit Spring with Stifel Nicolaus. Kit Spring - Stifel Nicolaus Regarding your investment in DirecTV, how do you see the video-on-demand product evolving and do you see the need for a broadband partner there? Thanks. Greg Maffei Well, thank you for the question. I think the video-on-demand product is going to be quite interesting, it highlights the strength of DIRECTV around the total TV experience and I think the implementation that they have looks quite interesting in beta compared to some of the alternatives in the cable universe. I think the question of how video-on-demand and the broadband partnerships work, as you know we are a larger one about our role in broadband. I think we're excited about the partnerships we have in broadband not only with Verizon and Quest but also the opportunities that we've looked at with people like Broadband of Powerline or the alternatives around things like Clearwire but that may not change. Continuing interest in seeing all of those many alternatives bloom or we are sort of in the Maoist school where a 1000 flowers bloom in broadband if that helps us that and so we are excited on how that works for our business overall and not just in video-on-demand and I think a lot of progress is being made there. Kit Spring - Stifel Nicolaus Thanks. Operator We will move to Imran Khan with JPMorgan. Imran Khan - JPMorgan Yes, hi. Thank you for taking questions. Two questions regarding QVC. And first and I was wondering if you can give us some sense how the QVC.com did this quarter. What percentage of your revenues came from QVC.com and how much it's up year-over-year basis? And second question is, can you give us some sense that inventory level trending in both in the US and International market? Thank you. Greg Maffei Imran, we did about 24% in the quarter. I think that's up about 23 or 22 last year. Mike? Mike George That's right. Its up from 23 last year. Roughly one point increase in penetration and are a 5% overall growth I believe. Greg Maffei And you want to talk about the inventories, Mike? Mike George Yeah. As a broad statements our inventories we think are in good shape. They creeped somewhat in Germany. As Germany, struggled with their sales velocity last year, the inventories ended up Q1 of this year to Q1 of last year up, a little bit higher than we would like. So we are focused on that. Our goal is to bring those inventories in line over the course of the year. Its not at a level that gives us a high concern. But, it's still higher than we would like. Other than that, we feel good about our inventory position in both the UK and US and we are also watching those very closely and erring on the conservative side in this environment. Our Japan business is primarily a consignment business so we don't have meaningful levels of inventory in Japan. Imran Khan - JPMorgan Right, thank you.  Greg Maffei Thank you. Operator Okay. Now from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Bazinet - Citi I think sometime last year maybe early this year there was an adverse IRS ruling regarding some of the tax deductibility of the non-cash interest related to your exchangeables, and I was just wondering if you could just summarize what that ruling was and then sort of a implication for cash that would flow from LINTA to LCAPA? Thank you. Greg Maffei Jason there was a ruling that we or resolution I'd more accurately state with the IRS that we had last quarter that was quite the opposite. There have been some precedents out there from Comcast and others that we believe we are very happy with our result compared to theirs and I will let Albert Rosenthal, our tax expert, and Gloria speak for a moment about it. Albert Rosenthal Our settlement with the IRS, we basically agreed that we will be able to continue to deduct both the cash and the contingent interest with respect to most of our exchangeable debentures. On two of the series we get to deduct the cash interest but not the contingent interest, so that is the settlement going forward. Jason Bazinet - Citi And what was the point of the delineation between the two where you can balance or you can't on the contingent? Albert Rosenthal On the two of that we were issued post-issuance of certain proposed regulations by the IRS back in 2001. Jason Bazinet - Citi Okay. All right and then the net implication for roughly in terms of the cash that will flow from LINTA to LCAPA? Greg Maffei That is about 200 -- it goes LINTA and LCAPA and it's -- that's a 150 issues, I think it was the right number. We can confirm that offline for you. Jason Bazinet - Citi Okay Greg Maffei Just to just understand how that's work, so that…We are deducting because of the equity feature that's embedded in those exchangeable, and the market costs embedded because of that equity feature Jason Bazinet - Citi Yeah. Greg Maffei We are deducting at an exceedingly higher rate than the cash interest being paid. Jason Bazinet - Citi Yes. Greg Maffei So that is a -- lets say we're deducting at 9% versus paying a three roughly. Jason Bazinet - Citi Yes. Greg Maffei But that is really a loan from the government, because we are going to eventually have to recapture some of those pieces. The LINTA pays for that tax shield rather than paying the US government, in the interim pays LCAPA for that tax shield. Jason Bazinet - Citi Understood. Okay, thank you very much. Operator Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley has our new question. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley Thanks. Greg on the DIRECTV debt issue yesterday, is this leverage level sort of optimal from your perspective or is it a function of just the credit markets and you expect more as the markets go little bit easier to tap later through this year? And then if I can ask the question on the Starz business, the subscription growth, I think you said 6% at Starz and 12 at Encore, there is obviously a lot of going on behind that that leads to a revenue growth number much lower. Can you guys give us a little more color on how we should think about the fixed-rate contracts versus the variable-rate contracts? And what that trend looks like going out over the next couple of years, so we can get a better sense for what the organic long-term growth is in this business? Greg Maffei Well I'll comment briefly on the DTV debt and let Bob who can talk about Starz. I think if we were here about a year ago, you'll have to get in line with all the investment bankers who were throwing us proposals to lend us money at many, many multiple of what the current debt level is. I'm not sure we would endorse what they were thinking then, and if the capital markets are constraining from imaging something to much higher than what DIRECTV is thinking right now. I think the optimal level is probably a little higher than the current, but not necessarily what people were thinking last spring and throwing at us -- while offering to throw us. Bob, you want to comment on that? Bob Clasen Yes. There are a number of moving pieces. Let me just summarize a couple of them and tell you the impact. Some of our affiliates have so called fixed deals, where there are for examples, steps and CPI adjustments for them acquiring and divesting of subscribers, those kinds of actions. And then there are of course, the consignment subscribers, which are more on a one-to-one basis. In addition, you have going on within this next situations, where sometimes we're accounting for revenue based on cash we receive, when we are between contracts and negotiation and until we get a settlement or reach some mutual agreement in various steps, its frankly I see a problems, hard to understand. Let me give you a simple example that’s easier to look at us on an annual basis because some of these deals drag on for a long period of time. We had transactions in the second and third quarter last year that if you normalize them over the first quarter, we would have compared to first quarter in '07 had a 5% revenue growth and 11% cash flow growth. So, not helpful, but its easier to look at us over the period of several running quarters because there are so many pieces and often they are tied to our top five or six affiliates that have such a impact on our overall revenue. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley Okay. That is helpful, Bob. And maybe I guess one follow-up on the Paramount Showtime deal or non-deal. What your thoughts given, what you see at Starz in terms of movie cost and the difficulty, getting incremental carriage, and you have a relationship with Paramount any thoughts on working with them on this JV? Any partnership opportunities that just would love to hear your thoughts on their outlook? Bob Clasen Well, I think at this point, they have made their decision to move in their own direction and it will be interesting to see, if there are other partners blockbusters have been mentioned. I don't know what that role would be. The background would be either three existing pay companies all got founded by company's that had massive distribution Time Warner with HBO, Viacom was a major cable company, when they found at Showtime and Starz is in our growth of TCI. I do think that the challenge in the first instances is to what's the box office performance. We are find of saying, we can run a three year old movie and beat most original series, HBO to their credit with the Sopranos, and Sex and the City. They are two gigantic hits in 35 years. So, movies still, uncut movies. In their original screen version, still do drive premium category and yet the original self with branding and identification. Our view would be any new venture, whether it's this new one or any has to have massive distribution in order to be successful and I am just quoting, what most of you have been saying at $3, any $13 million to $15 million to cover your costs, relative to the estimates of where they were with Showtime so. I think it's going to be a challenge, all you need to couple big partners to step up and say they want to do that, and it will happen. To your final point, we do have, what we think are the best MGM and Paramount films under exclusive license for pay that go well in to the next decade, so you are not going to be seeing a lot of the favorites from Paramount and MGM showing up on the new channel out of their library at least. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley Thanks a lot. Operator Our next question comes from Andy Baker with Jefferies & Company. Andy Baker - Jefferies & Company Thanks a lot. Just two questions, one I guess now that you reduced the number of film, reduced the outstanding amount of the Time Warner exchangeables. There is probably about 27 if I'm so I'm extremely sorry about $27 million shares of Time Warner that are not so under the exchangeable. I'm wondering if you plans to hedge those or maybe look for a transaction with Time Warner, where you can give us back and give one of their businesses and maybe looking to get rid of and then on the onto QVC I was wondering Mike you can talk little bit about the gross margin and may be it has some sort of trickling down a little bit not too much but little about little if there is any more granularity you can give us there and how we should think about that over the long-term? Greg Maffei On Time Warners exchangeable share we have little less than that that are free and clear, but we look to or always consider at 355 exchange with the company if that were available, and we have continuing dialog when I actually talked to Dick Parsons two days ago. I don't think there was anything on the horizon that will be obvious for us not to do that. I think we are we stayed un-hedged for that, partly because that effectively says we believe the stocks is pretty cheap. As you may recall, we did our deal last spring May, 16 that the stock was affectively by 21, so that was pretty good trade up and I think 16 is probably has some more room to run. The unhinging of the ,moment at least of the Microsoft, Yahoo deals probably will be a plus for AOLs and other stuff out there, so we'll take our chances for the moment on at least some piece of our Time Warner stock and we'll remain open to any interesting transactions with the company. We're talk about the QVC gross margin, Mike? Mike George Yes. And I think at a high level, we continue to view gross margins as -- we would see gross margins largely staying flat over time. So, while there have been some bumps recently, there is nothing that we're seeing that would make us feel that -- it kind of average gross margin level that we're typically run that will decline on a consistent basis over time. There have been some fairly discrete things that have happened in the gross margin line in the last 12 months. Most notably, the opening of major distribution center in Florence and another one in Japan and expansion in the UK and Germany, all of those -- the cost of those are our warehousing cost are in gross margin, and until your anniversary the opening of a big facility that's under utilize that the start you have a hit. So, that's sort of one-off issue. We clearly have had some product margin issues from quarter-to-quarter in different counties, particularly as we've seen electronics grow in the mix in a couple of countries and jewelry decline in the mix. And the combination of those two has caused a modest shift in gross margins but I view those as things that will ebb and flow over time. I don't think it's any long-term trend in the business. And as you know, we continue to avoid a higher level of promotional activity. We don't think its looks like our business model or needed and so, net of all that as, we feel pretty good about our margin levels, and that we're not going to face some sort of sustain secular decline in margins. Andy Baker - Jefferies & Company Okay, thanks guys. Operator Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Thanks. Few questions to Greg. I will ask you one and other two together, so it seems like the Discovery spinoff is taking longer than expected. You've got - you're really busy with Interactive Corp and DIRECTV to be able to finish the advanced (Inaudible) negotiations. I know this might not obviously be specifically you, but can you give us any update on, when we can expect the S4 filing on discover? Greg Maffei I'm going to talk that question to our esteemed General Counsel, Charles Tanabe. Charles Tanabe Well, first of all, this is a [DAP], call, but I expect that we will be filing an S4 in the very near future. I don’t there are any issues remaining with respect to the roll up.  Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank And then, typically what four to six weeks at the SEC and then you get to go? Bob Clasen Yeah, I think that's a pretty good guess. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank All right, so Greg in your [wheelhouse] what was the rational behind the agreement with DIRECTV to fix your voting power at 48%, I mean it was nice for DIRECTV of force, but I'm not sure how it helps Liberty? And then second, I suspect this is delicate subject, given tax regulations, but the lets take theoretical scenario by which you wanted to be able to merge LMDIA and DIRECTV. Let’s assume DIRECTV'S Board will be receptive even if you are not able to discuss the transaction with them yet. What steps do you need to take at LMDIA, and how long do those steps take, before you can be in a position to begin those talks with DIRECTV? Greg Maffei So, on the first question about why we agreed to freeze our voting power, I think we have a very positive relationship with the DIRECTV independent Board Members and we thought it was in their interest and ours. We understand why they wouldn’t want to take an action that would push us into voting hard control. I think that will be a difficult for a Board to do that, so they were left with choices either being sub-optimal in the capital structure or paying a dividend. Choices which they didn't find preferable, and we probably didn't either because we had -- even though, we have may be some tax advantages relative to how that income might come in. We are still not a tax efficient to us, is a repurchase. So that was a highly controversial thing for us to internally hereto agree to hold our votes flat. And we like only more DIRECTV economic we are not as averse to that. One the second question of what would have to be done, to complete a merger. It really depends on what kind of a merger you are thinking of. Because you could imagine scenarios in which, we offered LMDIA a tracking stock to do -- rolled up DirecTV, and if that was acceptable to their holders. That will take a certain amount of time, first to get a deal and then to get it through the FCC and the like, to the degree that you, first because they didn't not want to receive tracking stock imagined, some kind of spin transaction. I think that probably will be a longer term time frame just in terms of getting a spin done. May be four to six months, I am not, it's not something we've agreed to. We certainly thought about all of our options, but its not in our plan today. And if you then had a subsequent merger there would be some tax considerations around Morris Trust, which would ensure that -- would need to ensure that our shareholders who were, 51% of that combined vote and value on a go-forward basis. But if you look at the, assets in LMDIA including the 48% plus the other assets we have in there primarily Starz, the RSN etcetera less the net debt. I think that might be a reasonable scenario. It's unlikely we would combine in any scenario in which would be less than 51%. So, I don't think there is huge impediments to that. Its whether you could get the deal done is another matter. But there is no huge impediments on a tax basis. Just need more time involved with the spin. Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Right thank you.  Greg Maffei Yeah. Operator We'll hear next from Evergreen Management and Chris Taylor. Chris Taylor - Evergreen Management Thanks, that was my question as well, so… Greg Maffei That we anticipated. Chris Taylor - Evergreen Management Thanks. Operator We move now to Lehman Brothers and Vijay Jayant. Vijay Jayant - Lehman Brothers Given the recent ruling on the litigation with IAC, can you sort of talk about what your options are now? Is there any chance obviously of doing anything before the spins? And also any comment on what may and may not be done with Expedia? Thanks. Greg Maffei I think there is a host of options that are imaginable, but potentially us working with them on the spins on some agreed form going forward potentially, we are still doing a 355 transaction or we, I believe also filed at that time to a potentially appeal if there are -- if they go forward on a basis we don't like. So all options remains open and that could involve a deal also on Expedia but with that I'm not overly optimistic on that prospect. Vijay Jayant - Lehman Brothers As following up, I think QVC becomes a [five year trader] business in September or November of this year, so chance of LINTA being spun off, is that something even on the table? Greg Maffei That's not our current thinking and plans I mean in part because not to sound like we've totally drunken the tracker Kool-Aid just for no reason. Partly because we don't know for example look down the road or think about an LMDIA spin because that's a more attractive way to combine with DirecTV. Again we have no current plans for that but we certainly consider that as an alternative out there and whether that might foreclose or cause you think differently about spending QVC or LMDIA, we'll watch and see. Vijay Jayant - Lehman Brothers Thanks. Operator We'll take our next question up from April Horace with Janco Partners. April Horace - Janco Partners Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Greg, I think you've mentioned in the beginning of the call, something about a controlled liquidation of LCAPA. Could you expand on that? Greg Maffei Well, I think we believe that those exchangeables create lot of shield, at least on an interim basis, and if we're clever enough to figure out ways to get liquid on some of the investments in LMDIA -- excuse me, in LCAPA, on an tax efficient basis, we should be able to build some value there. The path is not clear. The obstacles are many and there is no near-term event or catalyst that's going to get us there. I do think over the long-term you are likely to be trying to get liquidity and or capture if you cannot capture some of the discount to this present value, some of the parts on pretax basis to the degree you can get the tax efficiently. But, that probably doesn't happen in the long-term -- in the short-term, rather it happens on a long-term basis. You're investing the capital that you have in assets to -- that hopefully out -- that out-earn what our liabilities are growing at. One point to note, we have to maintain a fair amount of liquidity at LCAPA. We can't, as some one might just look and say, why you got lot of cash and you have a relatively low market cap line. Why aren't you just buying the stock hand over fist? One of the challenges there, there are lot of our liabilities on the dead end, on the tax side, which could be accelerated in the events of third-party transactions over which we have no control. And so, we need to maintain a certain amount of liquidity if Sprint were sold or Motorola were sold tomorrow for cash, we need to maintain a certain amount of liquidity to ensure that we would be able to handle our obligations under that circumstance. So the face value of looking at it and saying, oh, there is obviously a huge discount and there is obviously enormous amount of cash, is not as clear once you start looking at what liabilities could be accelerated. So I go back to my statement about why if they control liquidation; I suspect it's a path where we're trying to get liquidity overtime, trying to reduce the size of the equity float, but it's probably something you chip at and you hope you can do well on that. There is no clear path up here. April Horace - Janco Partners And one point Dan, you mentioned that you might just some day bite the bullet and pay some tax, and I think that was probably more aimed at Motorola. Greg Maffei Well I don't thinks it as broad fit. That's certainly the case with 20/20 hindsight in which if we just sold an asset at some price and paid the tax it would have been better and that's only with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. So we will try and have more foresight and hopefully decide if there are cases where liquidating is better than holding out for better after-tax assumed value. April Horace - Janco Partners Okay great. That's all I've got. Operator We'll take our next question from [Brian Lorraine] with First Capital Alliance. Brian Lorraine - First Capital Alliance My question was just answered. Greg Maffei We are knocking them down here. Operator We go next to David Gober with Morgan Stanley. Greg Maffei David you have a question. Operator Hearing no response we move on to Andrew Cole with JL Advisors. Andrew Cole - JL Advisors Hi. Why you were buying back any stock when you thought there was a discount if any. Just your thought processes there? Greg Maffei I am sorry. On which track Cole. Andrew Cole - JL Advisors On LMDIA. Liberty Media. Greg Maffei Yeah at LMDIA the reason why, we try and maintain liquidity there is. You sort of go back the way we think about Liberty Capital. Unlike Liberty Interactive where we have big earning asset called QVC. We have a relative corresponding smaller earning asset there and we actually now have a fair amount of debt given the transaction we did to increase our stake at DIRECTV and if we were purchase stocks in size, we would be adding to that debt with no clear way to settle, other than potentially selling of assets, all which have relatively low tax basis. And in some cases we are prohibited from selling and in other cases we think it's strategic to hold more.  So, until you see clear pass to get to, an earning asset. I mean if you do tomorrow you are going to merge with DirecTV. Yeah you'd buy the heck of LMDIA because it's writing at a discount. But you don't know you are going to merge with DirecTV, you don't know you are going to have access their relatively larger cash flows to cover any debt that you put on. So until, we have a clear path about what the LMDIA future is, how we would settle that debt, we are probably unlikely to buy back in size. Andrew Cole - JL Advisors Okay. Thank you. Operator Our last question today comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen with Merrill Lynch Jessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch I have just two questions. I think you said on preview, that the cost -- well, you did say, the cost increased because you've expanded your relationship. Can you just outline how much it was for the quarter and what we should expect for the year? And secondly with your increased stake in Interactive, could you discuss again, not in this call but again have you happen to pass? How possible or likely it is for you to acquire Home Shopping Network and if that is a possibility, what benefit there are to you since you have said in the past there were not a lot of cost savings? Thanks. Greg Maffei Mike, do you want to talk about the increased cost of carriage? Mike George Yes, the increased cost for Freeview was about a 127 basis points and we will anniversary that in the fourth quarter. Greg Maffei And on HSN, we remain open to a transaction it can be done at attractive price I think what the management team and Liberty have thought is if you look at the operating structures and we haven't done extensive due diligence on HSN, but if you look at the operating structures it isn't apparent that there is enormous cost synergies i.e. items you could knock out because -- it's like a accounts payable or accounts receivable or other G&A function. There is some amount but it's not huge. A large portion of what else's in there in the cost side relates to variable items that probably not be able to or fixed items will not be able to eliminate. You would need to have the two broadcaster facilities for example if you want to keep both present. The potential that seems less clear, but you would think given the relative $4.5 billion-ish revenue stream we had in the US and a $2 billion-ish revenue stream that they have in the US you would like to think you would find some synergies perhaps in purchasing, perhaps in counter programming, when we ran jewelry, they ran power tools or vice versa, so that you were not attacking the same audience. Those are harder to capture, harder to know. As I said we've not done extensive due diligence internally on HSN. Mike, would you add anything. Mike George No. Nothing else to add. Greg Maffei So, that's it operator. I want to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Liberty Media. Operator And that concludes today's Liberty Media Corporation first quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for attending and have a good day.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer, Greg Maffei. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Maffei Thank you and thank you all for joining us this morning and your interest in Liberty Media.  Today we're going to talk about the year overall and review the quarter by tracker. We're also going to discuss the operating performance at the subsidiaries we control. We'll cover some of the transactions we went through in Q4 and subsequent to the quarters' end and some other development that we've had ongoing. With me are our Controller, Chris Shean, who will discuss our attributed business's financial results and liquidity picture for each of the three trackers; QVC's CEO, Mike George, who will discuss the developments at QVC; Starz CEO Bob Clasen, who'll review recent events at Starz. Also on the call and available are QVC's CFO Dan O'Connell, Starz' President and COO, Bill Meyers, and Starz CFO Glenn Curtis, and several other senior Liberty executives. As I said, all will be available at the end to answer questions after the prepared remarks. No surprise that 2008 was a volatile year for Liberty as it was for literally all the businesses in the United States and perhaps the world. All of our equities were significantly affected, though some less than others. We are working on the factors that are under our control in terms of reducing risk, reducing costs, maintaining liquidity and maintaining flexibility, and I think we made good progress on several fronts, particularly in light of the financial environment, the retail environment, and we're happy with that progress. At Liberty Interactive we worked to increase liquidity. We drew down on our bank facility. We changed the attribution of the Viacom exchangeable debt, which added its fair value to that debt, $380\xa0million in cash to Liberty Interactive. And we continued the process of selling some of our high basis non-high vote, our low-vote shares of IAC. We reduced debt at Liberty Interactive by repurchasing our senior notes by about $1.4 billion. On average we paid about $0.86 for those and that's going to reduce our interest expense going forward because we pay less on our borrowings there under the bank facility than we do on that straight debt. Our ecommerce companies continued to do well in a tough environment. They are focused on the interplay between content, community and commerce, and that has worked well for them. We completed several fold-in acquisitions, including companies like Red Envelope and Celebrate Express. And we had success as we rolled out new ODATs - one deal at a time in that business including Way Cheap, Chain Love, and other new ODATs that we have.  QVC, obviously the largest element in that Liberty Interactive business, continued to generate significant levels of adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow in a difficult environment. QVC Japan, in particular, continued its recovery from the health and beauty regulation enforcement of 2007. It posted strong operating results.  Turning now to Liberty Entertainment, at the highest level we obviously introduced the tracker back in March and announced the split off of the majority of assets and liabilities. We reconstituted the split off in December. Last month we filed the required documents with the SEC, IRS and FCC to proceed with the split off. Some have asked and note the serious investment that we have made and are proposing to make further will not affect the timing of that split off. During the course of 2008 through our own actions and share repurchase by DIRECTV, we increased our stake from 41% of the economics at DIRECTV to approximately 54%. In addition, as you may recall, we are at 48% of the votes under a standstill agreement with the company. As I mentioned, our stake went up both through the repurchase by DIRECTV.  They continue to remain a significant free cash flow generator and a relatively underleveraged - something like 0.6 net leverage on a proforma basis - company and they have announced the extension of their buyback, so we will expect our share will continue to increase there, our economic stake. But in addition we did through our own transaction purchase about 78 million shares in a lowcost collar with attractive financing that looks particularly low cost and attractive today. So those combination have driven us to 54% and with their announced repurchase extension, we expect to go higher.  We continue to remain very pleased with that company and with the swap we did with News Corp. on a mark basis. Given both their strength and the relative weakness of News Corp., we're ahead by something like $8 billion as well as increased basis, strategic flexibility and other valuable elements. As I noted, DIRECTV continues to perform quite well. Starz Entertainment also performs well in a challenging environment, seemingly affirming the thesis that subscription businesses are more recession resistant than some of our other businesses. At Liberty Capital we bought in 33.2 million shares. That's about 26% on a cumulative basis of all the shares that were outstanding at the time that tracker began trading. Just this month we announced also that we would be extending $530 million in loans to SIRIUS XM. We think that's a good deal for Liberty Capital as well as for SIRIUS XM.  We like the fundamentals of the satellite radio business. We like the management team. We like the fact that they've been able to grow subscribers even in a very difficult financial and auto environment, and we're optimistic about the position we have, which is a secured senior debt position, and the upside we have with approximately 40% of the company in the form of warrants. So we think there's relative safety on our capital and upside for our shareholders. We are working diligently to complete Phase 2 of that transaction, in which we will actually receive that 40% of the equity and hope to have news on that in the coming weeks.  With that high level view of the year and the quarter, let me turn it over to Chris to talk about the financial results at Liberty Interactive. Chris Shean Thanks, Greg. Liberty Interactive Group's revenue decreased 4% to $2.38 billion in the fourth quarter and increased 4% to $8.08 billion for the year, while adjusted OIBDA declined 21% to $432\xa0million for the quarter and 8% to $1.56 billion for the year. QVC is the primary driver of results amongst the Liberty Interactive attributed assets. It continues to operate in a challenging retail environment, and its total revenue decreased 8% in the fourth quarter to $2.14 billion and 1% to $7.3 billion for the year, while adjusted OIBDA decreased 22% to $416 million in the fourth quarter and 9% to $1.5 billion for the year. Liberty Interactive's other ecommerce businesses, which include Provide Commerce, backcountry.com, BodyBuilding.com, and BuySeasons again posted strong financial results and continue to grow at a rapid pace. In total our ecommerce businesses experienced revenue growth of 65% in the fourth quarter and 92% for the year. Adjusted OIBDA grew 19% in the fourth quarter and 78% for the year.  The increase in revenue for the quarter was primarily driven by the impact of the BodyBuilding.com acquisition, which happened at the end of 2007, and strong organic growth at the other ecommerce companies. The increase in revenue for the year was due to the same fourth quarter factors as well as the inclusion of a full year of results for backcountry.com.  The increase in adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was due to organic growth at certain of the ecommerce companies and the BodyBuilding.com acquisition. The increase in the adjusted OIBDA for the year was due to the organic growth at most of the ecommerce companies and the backcountry.com and BodyBuilding.com acquisitions.  Now turning to QVC, their 2008 results, its consolidated revenue declined 1% for the year to $7.3\xa0billion while adjusted OIBDA declined 9% to $1.5 billion. Domestic revenue decreased 6% during 2008 to $4.91 billion as the mix of products sold shifted to beauty from the jewelry area. The average selling price increased 4%, while total units shipped declined 8%. 2008 domestic adjusted OIBDA decreased 14% to $1.07 billion, while the adjusted OIBDA margin decreased 210\xa0basis points to 22% primarily due to lower gross margin percentages as a result of lower initial product margins across all product categories, higher inventory obsolescence, and bad debt provisions, as well as not achieving leverage on our fixed cost base. These decreases in adjusted OIBDA margin were partially offset by an increase in QCard income and a decrease in market expenses.  QVC.com sales continued to grow as a percentage of overall domestic sales, rising from 22.2% in 2007 to 25.3% in 2008.  International revenue increased 9% to $2.39 billion during the year, while adjusted OIBDA grew 6% to $432 million. Revenue growth was due to sales growth in all international markets in addition to favorable foreign currency exchange rates in Germany and Japan. Adjusted OIBDA margins declined 58 basis points primarily due to lower initial product margins and higher commission costs as a percentage of net revenue due to new fixed-rate agreements in the U.K. and Japan.  In 2008 QVC U.K. local currency revenue increased 2% on a 2% growth in units.  In Japan QVC experienced 11% local currency revenue growth, with a 17% growth in units. QVC Japan has continued to successfully show gains in jewelry and apparel and shift away from the health and beauty products due to the high regulatory focus on those products that began in 2007.  In Germany our business experienced revenue growth of 3% on a local currency basis and 6% on a 6% growth in units. Now we'll review QVC's results for the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenue declined 8% to $2.14\xa0billion while adjusted OIBDA declined 22% to $416 million. Domestic revenue decreased 12% during the fourth quarter to $1.48 billion as the mix of products sold shifted from jewelry to beauty and to a lesser extent home products. The average selling price increased 3% while total units shipped declined 12%.  Fourth quarter domestic adjusted OIBDA decreased 29% to $282\xa0million while the adjusted OIBDA margin decreased 459 basis points to 19%, primarily due to lower gross margin percentages as a result of lower initial product margins across all product areas, higher inventory obsolesce and bad debt provisions, as well as severance costs and not achieving leverage on our fixed cost base. These decreases in adjusted OIBDA margin are partially offset by an increase in QCard income and a decrease in marketing expenses.  QVC.com sales continued to grow as a percentage of overall domestic sales, rising from 22.5% in 2007 to 27.8% in the fourth quarter of 2008.  International revenue for the quarter decreased slightly to $655 million, including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in the U.K. and Germany, while adjusted OIBDA decreased 1% to $134 million. Adjusted OIBDA margins remained flat in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter QVC U.K. local currency revenue local currency revenue decreased 4% on a 6% decline in units. In Japan, QVC experienced 19% local currency revenue growth, continuing the double-digit quarterly sales growth from the second quarter of 2008. Units shipped in Japan were up 22% for the quarter. In Germany our business experienced revenue growth of 6% on a local currency basis, with a 10% increase in units shipped. Now with that I'll hand it over to Mike George for additional QVC comments. Mike George Thanks, Chris. QVC was obviously impacted by the same economic challenges all the other retailers faced in Q4, so it was a tough quarter for us. However, we feel good that we responded early and aggressively to the consumer spending slowdown, and we do feel that we're well positioned to ride out this economic storm and emerge in a stronger competitive position.  In the U.S. our sales declined 12%. Jewelry and apparel were our most challenged categories, as they were all year. Although we saw generally soft results across most categories, beauty was the one exception. That business continues to be very strong for us. Most of this decline, if you look at it from a customer perspective, was driven by core customers purchasing at a slightly lower frequency, which I think reflects their caution in this environment. It was not primarily driven by a reduction in new customers or by customer defections, so we do think that our customer purchasing funnel remains fundamentally healthy. Our adjusted OIBDA declined by 29%. That decline was driven by several factors. The reduced mix of higher-margin categories like jewelry, coupled with the somewhat higher take rate on our more promotional offers like the Today's Special Value, drove 170 basis point decline in initial product margins. We also saw an increase in markdowns in the quarter as we tried to keep our inventories clean, but that increase in markdowns had a relatively modest impact on the total margin. Our gross margins were also hampered by a 65 basis point increase in obsolescence rates as our liquidation activity increased. That said, we're pleased with how we ended the quarter on inventory. We were able to reduce inventory levels from their September peak at twice the rate of reduction that we experienced in the prior Q4. And while both liquidation and markdown rates were up in the quarter, in total our combined markdown and liquidation activity represented only 5% of sales, which is obviously well below the level most retailers experienced in Q4. And we are maintaining a very conservative posture on inventory receipts as we go into 2009. We also saw a significant increase in our bad debt rate, up 83 basis points. We continue to monitor bad debt levels carefully and we're taking appropriate actions to constrain credit lines and improve our ability to collect on our receivables. Our write-off rate on the QCard, which is our proprietary credit card, was 5.95%. That's up from 3.96% in the prior year. So bad debt clearly is rising; however, I'd emphasize that our write-off rates, even at 5.95%, are way below those of most other retailers. That reflects our historically conservative posture to issuing credit and the strong loyalty of our customers who want to keep those cards current. We continue to be very diligent in the management of our expenses and we took some difficult actions in November to prepare for what we expected would be a challenging 2009. As you may recall, we announced layoffs of approximately 900 associates in November, including about 150 in our corporate and site staff and about 750 related to the closure of our Westchester customer service center and the downsizing of our Westchester jewelry distribution center. Along with other expense actions we took, these initiatives resulted in a $30 to $40 million reduction in our 2009 forecasted operating costs. We did incur about $10.4 million of severance costs in Q4 and will incur another $2 or $3\xa0million of severance costs in 2009 related to these actions.  Now despite our disappointing sales results, we do believe our customers are responding to our initiatives to offer compelling products, entertaining lifestyle programming, and great values. We had many successful brand launches in the quarter, including American Girl dolls and Rachel Ray cookware, and our 12 Days of Christmas Sweepstakes - where we gave away one Smart Car every day - brought added viewership and attention to our brand. Our efforts to pass along savings we received from our vendors in the form of special holiday price breaks drove incremental revenue, and we launched the most comprehensive makeover of our sets in 12 years to strong customer reviews. Our focus on strengthening our QVC.com platform is also paying off. As Chris mentioned, our Internet sales as a percent of total sales were 28% in Q4. That's up 5% from the prior year and it's by far our steepest one quarter gain in Internet penetration, so we think we have a lot of momentum in that platform. These efforts continue into 2009. Already this year we've garnered great media interest and strong viewership for several breakthrough programming events, including celebrating New Year's Eve in Vienna, broadcasting from Washington for the inauguration, conducting a live runway show under the tents of Bryant Park for fashion week, and broadcasting live from L.A. with Ellen DeGeneres on her set. And just last week we had the exclusive worldwide launch of the new Dell Mini before even Dell.com had it, garnering strong media attention and terrific sales.  So we recognize we have an uphill fight against this declining consumer spending in the industry. We do believe this focus on elevated programming, great brands, and great values will allow us to hold our own and likely gain market share without resorting to the kinds of deep markdowns we're seeing at traditional retail. Now let me turn to International. Japan continued it's strong turnaround. We fully anniversaried the impact of the heightened health and beauty regulations early in Q4 and the team's efforts to build their fashion and jewelry business to offset declines elsewhere paid off with a 19% increase in revenue and an 18% increase in adjusted OIBDA in local currency. However, we also recognize that the Japanese economy began a sharp decline in Q4 and so we're monitoring the business carefully in the face of deteriorating economic conditions, and we'll make adjustments as necessary should those conditions impact our business. We were pleased with the progress in Germany, which posted one of its best quarters in years with a 6% revenue increase in local currency driven by strong growth in both beauty and electronics and a 16% increase in adjusted OIBDA. That OIBDA margin improvement was driven principally by a significant decline in inventory levels versus the prior year as we focused to get the inventories clean, and that resulted in a highly favorable obsolesce [write]. We also were very aggressive in the management of our operating expenses.  Now I will say that despite these overall positive results our sales in Germany were bolstered to some extent by increased markdown activity as we worked to clean up the inventory, so while we're encouraged by the progress in Germany, I don't want to overstate where we are in the turnaround. We still have challenges in front of us to get that business operating as consistently as we would like it to be, but we're on a solid track.  Our U.K. business had a challenging quarter as they felt the full effects of the economic slowdown as well as the impact of highly unfavorable exchange rates. Their revenue declined 4% in local currency, driven in part by softness in the jewelry category and with their Today's Special Value offerings. U.K. was especially hard hit on the profit line, with adjusted OIBDA falling 20% in local currency.  The biggest driver of this decline was the impact of the strengthening dollar. The unfavorable FX impact resulted in a 200 basis point gross margin decline as much of our product is purchased in dollars and we were unable to pass the rising cost of the dollar along in terms of higher pricing to customers, so it resulted in an unfavorable gross margin variance. So while these FX issues had a real impact on the quarter and those challenges will likely continue through at least the first half of '09, we don't think the margin weakness in the U.K. suggests any fundamental long-term issues as much as it is a temporary challenge of adjusting to fairly rapid movements in the exchange rates.  We're also continuing to progress on the launch of the Italy market, which we announced last fall, and we expect to meet our October 2010 launch timetable.  Finally, we kept a tight lid on capital spending throughout the year and ended 2008 with total capital spend of $143 million. We expect capital spend for 2009 to be in the range of $160 to $180\xa0million. We have focused that spend on high value ROI positive initiatives, including new ecommerce and CRM platforms and the consolidation of our SKU-intensive fashion and jewelry businesses into our Florence distribution center, which will be a state of the art DC that will help us reduce processing costs and consolidate orders for our customers. That said, we're also prepared to pull this capital spend down should business conditions materially deteriorate.  In closing, as we look at 2009, as I said at the outset, we believe we are prepared for whatever the economy brings us. We have reduced operating expenses in all markets, and we're prepared to flex down those costs and our capital spend further if needed. Overall we're comfortable with our inventory levels and we're maintaining a tight control on new inventory receipts. We're managing our bad debt exposure tightly as well.  And while the weakness in consumer spending in all markets will continue to create sales challenges, we do feel confident that the actions we're taking\xa0 expanding the range and diversity of our brand and product offerings, bringing entertaining lifestyle programming to our views from Ellen DeGeneres to Elizabeth Hasselbeck and Rachel Ray and remotes from around the world, our efforts to expand our multimedia footprint through new web, mobile and social networking applications - we believe all of those initiatives will help us gain share from our brick-and-mortar competitors.  And with that I'll turn it back to Chris. Chris Shean Thanks, Mike.  Now let's take a quick look at the Liberty Interactive liquidity picture. At the end of 2008 the group had attributed cash and public investments of $2.5 billion and $7.6 billion in attributed debt. During the fourth quarter, as we had mentioned earlier, we changed the attribution of the long-term exchangeable Viacom debt in cash from Liberty Entertainment to LINTA. This change in attribution provided $380 million of cash while adding $551 million face amount of debt to LINTA. We further increased cash through our sales of IEC shares; however, the fair value of our public holdings did decline by $827 million with the overall declines in the market. During the quarter we successfully completed two tender offers, which reduced the balance of our senior notes at LINTA by $1.4 billion.  Moving on to Liberty Entertainment, attributed revenue grew 26% in the fourth quarter to $360\xa0million and 22% to $1.39 billion for the year, while adjusted OIBDA increased 143% to $107\xa0million for the quarter and 27% to $324 million for the year. The increase in revenue and adjusted OIBDA for both periods was due to the addition of the Liberty Sports Group, which was acquired in February of 2008 as part of the News Corp. exchange and organic growth at Starz Entertainment.  Taking a closer look at Liberty Entertainment's principal consolidated subsidiary, Starz Entertainment, its revenue increased 8% in the fourth quarter to $285 million and 4% for the year to $1.11 billion. The increase in revenue for both periods resulted from an increase in rates and the growth in the average number of subscription units. Starz and Encore's average subscribers increased 7% and 8% respectively during the year. Starz adjusted OIBDA increased 69% during the fourth quarter to $81 million and increased 14% for the year to $301 million.  Operating expenses decreased 6% for the quarter and increased 1% for the year. The decrease for the quarter was due to decreases in programming and G&A expenses, partially offset by increased marketing costs. The increase in operating expenses for the year was driven by increased marketing and advertising costs related to Starz' new branding campaign and support of the new Starz original, Crash, and an increase in market support. These increase were partially offset by lower programming costs, which decreased from $656 million in 2007 to $629\xa0million in 2008.  Also in the fourth quarter Starz Entertainment reported a $1.24 billion goodwill impairment as part of its annual FAS 142 analysis, and this was primarily due to the current economic conditions and it's overall market effect on valuation multiples, which caused the triggering event. I will point out that the large charge was caused by the Step 2 portion of the test, which required significant amounts of value to be attributed to other intangibles rather than goodwill, and therefore when you compare the implied value of the goodwill under the Step 2 test to the recorded amount, that's what drove the large portion of the charge. Let's take a look at the Liberty Entertainment liquidity picture. At quarter end L. Media was attributed with approximately $12.8 billion of public investment. In addition to its public holdings, Liberty Entertainment had attributed cash and liquid investments of $807\xa0million at quarter end. Total cash and public holdings approximated $13.6 billion, well in excess of the $2\xa0billion face amount of the attributed debt.  Now I'll turn it over to Bob Clasen, who will comment on Starz Entertainment and Media. Bob Clasen  Thanks, Chris.  No company can claim to be immune to the economic downturn, but the fourth quarter results for Starz Entertainment demonstrate that at least so far subscription television, providing lowcost entertainment for the family, has held up reasonably well. Our home video business has been more vulnerable to the worsening economic conditions, however, and we have seen announcements by other media companies of negative results and in particular the decline in DVD sales. On the theatrical front, Overture Films in its first year released eight films with three actors earning Oscar or Golden Globe nominations and finished 11th among all studios in terms of box office for the year. However, the overall performance of Overture Films for the year fell short of our projections, and at Anchor Bay Entertainment strong sales of the Overture Films movies partially offset weakened sales of catalog products. Starz Entertainment enjoyed another quarter of solid growth. Subscriptions to our Starz service increased by 1.4 million in 2008 and perhaps more importantly in this time of economic decline added 300,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter. Encore also continued to grow, adding a million subscribers in 2008 and 100,000 in the fourth quarter. Much of this growth came with the continued rollout of video services by the telephone companies, where the penetration for our networks, particularly Starz, is considerably higher than it is with cable or satellite. For the year we generated revenue of $1.11 billion versus $1.07 billion for the prior year. Adjusted OIBDA for the year improved to $301 million from $264 million in 2007, largely driven by the decline in the cost for films. For the quarter we generated $285 million in revenue, up from $265 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $278 million in the third quarter of 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2008, adjusted OIBDA was $81 million, up from $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, and $78 million in the third quarter of 2008.  On the ratings front, Starz finished the year tied with HBO for 9th place in total day ratings among the 82 networks rated by Nielsen in television households with all premium services, and we continue to be among the top-rated networks in the on-demand arena.  Our strategy to invest in original programming continued to move ahead in the fourth quarter. In October we premiered our first hour-long dramatic series, Crash, co-produced with Lions Gate. The series held the audience well versus the programming that had appeared previously in the same time slot and generated widespread publicity as well as promotional co-ventures with most of our major affiliates. Yesterday we announced that we will air a second season of Crash later this year. Also in the fourth quarter we made three original programming announcements - another season of the half-hour comedy Head Case, with a robust lineup of guest stars, including Jerry Seinfeld and Hugh Hefner; a second half-hour comedy Party Down, produced by Rob Thomas, about the antics of out-of-work actors employed by a Los Angeles catering company; and finally, plans to produce and televise a new hour-long dramatic series, Spartacus, from producers Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert. The series will make use of some of the cinematic techniques that were employed in films such as Sin City and The 300 and will, we expect, have strong appeal to the male 18 to 34 demographic. This will be the first dramatic series for the Starz channels produced by Starz Media, for which we will hold all rights. This lineup of exclusive originals will enable us to differentiate our network, to create a library of programming that we can air on the Starz channels, and to monetize the productions by selling the programming in home video and domestic and international syndication. Looking ahead, a decline in programming costs may be slowed by the recent announcement of Disney, where they've reached an agreement to distribute six films per year from DreamWorks. As a result of this arrangement, the number of qualifying films that Starz is required to take from Disney may increase starting in 2010.  We also extended our agreements with Sony Pictures. This agreement, combined with the output product from Overture Films, will provide us with a strong lineup of content well into the next decade.  On the affiliate front we signed an extension of our agreement with Time Warner Cable which will provide for the rollout of Starz On Demand to all of the Time Warner Cable systems this year. Time Warner had been the only major cable operator that had not offered Starz On Demand to its customers. Turning to Starz Media, we generated an adjusted OIBDA loss of $189 million for the year on revenue of $321\xa0million. This compares to the 2007 adjusted OIBDA loss of $143\xa0million on revenue of $274 million. The losses are due to continued investments in the production and distribution of programming that will not realize its full revenue potential for several years.  Overture Films in its first full year of operation released eight films, including The Visitor, which earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for its star, Richard Jenkins, and Last Chance Harvey, which garnered Golden Globe nominations for Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson. Several Overture Films [streeted] in home video and premiered on payperview in the quarter and generated strong sales. Mad Money, the first of the Overture theatrical releases, premiered on the Starz channels in October to a solid 2.4 rating.  In October we announced the formation of Anchor Bay Films to produce and acquire eight to 10 films per year for limited theatrical release followed by home video distribution. In January Anchor Bay Films announced the acquisition of the Sundance Festival comedy hit, Spread, starring Ashton Kutcher. Anchor Bay focused a large part of its efforts on the home video sales of Overture movies. In the non-theatrical arena, however, Anchor Bay titles captured three of the top 10 slots in the fitness DVD category and increased fitness net sales by 23% in 2008 versus the prior year. Tale of Tails, the first of the DVD releases based on the Wow! Wow! Wubbzy television show, debuted at number four in the children's non-theatrical unit sales.  Turning to Starz Animation, the fourth quarter saw the release of the DVD of Space Chimps, our Grated feature film that was in theaters during the summer. Our Toronto was in production on three movies for other U.S. major theatrical distributors. Film Roman continued to produce The Simpsons, its 20th season, and King of the Hill, and was in pre-production on two Marvel series and another for ABC. Wow! Wow! Wubbzy is in season two on Nick Jr., where it ended the year as the second highest rated show. This should help with 2009 sales of both DVDs and licensing and marketing for this hit children's series. 2008 was the first year in which we were able to see the first results of our strategy of audience aggregation. These early results have been extremely gratifying as the first films were released theatrically by Overture, taken to home video by Anchor Bay, aired on the Starz channels, and sold into pay-per-view and television syndication via our own in-house sales teams. This enables us to achieve two objectives - first, to monetize the programming across multiple platforms using our own in-house distribution and sales units, and second, to build a library of films and original series that we can use in a variety of ways for as long as they will draw audiences. And now I'll hand it back to Chris. Chris Shean Thanks, Bob.  Let's take a look at Liberty Capital. During the quarter Liberty Capital revenue increased 44% to $131\xa0million while adjusted OIBDA deficit decreased 20% to $106 million. For the year revenue increased 27% to $617 million and the adjusted OIBDA deficit increased 40% to $294\xa0million. The increase in revenue for both periods was primarily due to revenue growth at Starz Media from theatrical releases and the inclusion of a full year of operation of the Atlanta Braves. The increase in the adjusted OIBDA deficit for the year was due to marketing and advertising costs associated with these film releases and the full year inclusion of the Atlanta Braves.  From October 30, 2008 through February 24, 2009, Liberty repurchased 1.6 million shares of Series\xa0A Liberty Capital common stock at an average price of $11.51 for total cash consideration of $18 million. Now, I'd point out that the majority of these repurchases were through physical settlements of put options that were written in mid-2008.  Cumulative for 2008, Liberty has repurchased 33.2 million shares at an average cost per share of $14.37 for total cash consideration of $478 million, which represent 25.7% of the shares outstanding. Now let's take a look at Liberty Capital's liquidity. The Liberty Capital Group has attributed cash and public investments of $5.4 billion and attributed debt of $4.95 billion. This cash and public investments figure excludes $104 million of Liberty holdings in the Reserve Primary Fund. Last week we received a $35 million distribution from the fund and the current balance outstanding is approximately $69 million. We believe we will receive additional distributions from the fund, but timing is uncertain. As such, we have reclassified this amount from cash into short-term investments. All that said, I'll now turn the call back over to Greg. Greg Maffei Thanks, Chris, and thank you, Mike and Bob, for your updates on your businesses.  Well, looking at 2008, no surprise. For us as many others it was extremely challenging in light of the unpredictable economic environment. Nonetheless, we continued to focus on, as Mike outlined, cutting costs at QVC and growing in the face of that environment our ecommerce businesses which, like our other subscription businesses, continued to perform well. It's certainly hard to know when economic conditions will improve. We're not betting on that. We're trying to manage for the long haul in the face of difficult conditions. At Entertainment, as you know, we announced the split off of the vast majority of [LVI.] We hope to get that done in the coming months. We increased our stake in DIRECT, as noted, and we had good operating performance at those subscription businesses.  At Liberty Capital we focused on shrink and to rationalization as we will ahead.  Looking at 2009, at Interactive we're obviously focusing on the operations first and foremost, running the business efficiently, thinking about creative ways to maintain and grow revenue, looking at Internet and digital expansion in a cost-effective manner. We will be opportunistic on small acquisitions as we were in 2008 with Red Envelope and Celebrate, and we think more of those may become available.  We are focused on liquidity and our capital structure. We note the covenants that we have at the QVC bank debt and we are working on the 2011 maturities and plan to make sure, even in light of the fact that they're more than two years away, that we're prepared to handle them and we believe we will be. At Liberty Entertainment we're going to focus getting the split off done and other ways to maximize shareholder value, in particular reducing the discount to NAV at Liberty Entertainment.  At Liberty Capital we'll continue to try and monetize our non-core holdings in a tax-efficient manner. Frankly, taxes have become less of an issue given the relatively low prices that they are at today. We will look to effectively deploy capital in situations like SIRIUS XM if we see them, but we'll also look to reduce our debt, shrink our equity, and in other ways maximize our NAV. We also trade at enormous discount to NAV at Liberty Capital, and we are focused on ways to reduce that. So thank you for your support and interest in Liberty Media, and with that, Operator, we'd be happy to turn it over for [calls]. Question-and-Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Securities. Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Securities Any chance you can give us what the RSNs EBITDA might have been for the full year '08 if you'd owned them the whole year?  Second, I'm curious what you wrote the value of Starz down to? What do you think Starz is worth right now? And lastly, any chance you can fine-tune the split off timing? You've been saying May\xa0 June. Are we sort of still on track for that? Any closer on timing would be helpful. Greg Maffei I'll handle the second one first, and I'll come back on the first - the second and third, then the first. Starz, let's be clear. What we wrote down has not any implication per se to what we think the business is worth. There are a strict series of rules and tests which are triggered based on market multiples, projected cash flows and the like which don't necessarily suggest what we think the business is worth. So I'll make that point and I'll let Chris, if he wants to add anything on that, Chris Shean, our Controller, if he wants to add anything, I'll come back to that. On LMDA timing, we are May - June affirming, and that's about as precise as we think we can be. Obviously, there are factors which are in our control and other ones in which we're relying on estimates of third parties and those seem like reasonable estimates. Do you want to comment on Starz? Chris Shean Yes, and the RSNs as well.  I guess the RSNs sort of on a pro forma basis, EBITDA would be about $33 million for 2008. On the Starz thing, the biggest part of the charge actually is the second part of the test. The first part of the test is you compare estimates of fair value of equity to your carrying value of your equity, and if you fail that test by $1 then you go to the second part of the test, which is you take that fair value that you just came up with and you do a hypothetical purchase allocation as if you had bought the company at that price. And you go through this purchase allocation. You allocate to all of the assets and liabilities of the company, including intangibles, other intangibles, and in this case all of Starz's legacy intangible balances, affiliation agreements, had been fully amortized through the years, so when you go through this hypothetical exercise and you allocate to these other intangibles, there's very little left over to allocate to goodwill. So then you compare this implied goodwill balance to what you actually have on the books, which in our case was $1.3 billion, and thus you end up with a very large charge.  So that's a little bit more color and probably more accounting speak than anybody wanted to hear, but that's what drove the charge.  Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Securities The bottom line, Greg, is your future view on the cash flows at Starz can produce haven't changed? Greg Maffei No. Starz's cash flows have been very strong. I think we bottomed out at 175 post our Comcast renegotiation or even below 150 - 175 in my tenure; Bob Clasen is rightly pointing out before I got here it actually was 150 - and we did 301 on our way to double-digit 20% type growth we project this coming year. We think those businesses are growing well in Entertainment and we're excited about them, and these accounting tests have relatively little to do with that. Operator Your next question comes from [James Raco] - Barclays Capital. James Raco - Barclays Capital I had two on LMDIA and one on LCAPA.  On LMDIA, after ELI spins what are your thoughts on the stub? Does it make sense for it to be stand-alone or should we really roll back in? And secondly, is there any tax or regulatory restriction on announcing the terms of an LMDIADTV deal before the Entertainment spin actually takes place? And on LCAPA, with a lot of liquidity now, the Sprint hedge is maturing in 2009 - 2010. You mentioned sort of a number of possible options. Can you talk about how you think about using that liquidity among acquisitions, share repurchase or maybe buying back some of the exchangeable debt? Greg Maffei On the LEI spin what happens to what effectively will be Starz, cash and the wild blue equity, we will see where it trades. We have no announced plan. It will be a relatively small public company. It will be relatively hard to know what its strategic direction is. We think there's a lot of positive things that are happening in Starz, but we'll see whether that should ultimately be a publicly traded tracker or whether it more appropriately belong recombined in some way. Stay tuned. No decision.  On a question of could you announce merger terms with DIRECTV prior to completing the spin, I believe you could. You would be subject to ensure non-taxability, a whole bunch of [inaudible], probably the most important of which is Morris Trust, which would say that our shareholders have 51% of vote and value in any post-spin merge combination. Albert Rosenthal is giving me the nod that I've got that right, and we're very cognizant of that. But frankly, if you look at the economic value in any kind of combination, we probably would not accept any deal that had less than 51% of vote and value, so that probably is not a restraining factor as a practical matter. Last question on Starz, we will have a fair amount of liquidity at Starz. We have a fair amount of liquidity now - excuse me, LCAPA. We do at Starz as well, but at LCAPA - thank you; I meant LCAPA - and the Sprint collar's maturing will only further enhance that.  We will look for deals like SIRIUS XM. We will consider debt repurchase. We are noteworthy of the five and five deal that got approved in the stimulus bill that for five years you will not recognize any COD income on a debt repurchase, and then you will recognize it ratably over the next five years. On a present value basis that's quite attractive in terms of changing the dynamics of debt repurchase for Liberty. And there frankly may be some other things that happen in how that bill is interpreted that make it more opportunistic for us or more realistic for us to look at even attacking some of our exchangeables. We are working through that. Stay tuned on that as well.  And lastly, as I noted, we shrunk about 26% of the equity of LCAPA. We consider that equity undervalued. The potential to repurchase more of that is also on the table. So all three things, to answer, are things we have already executed on in the way to debt repurchase that gets better in a post-stimulus bill through attractive and, in this case debt, focused with warrant kicker investment in the case of SIRIUS XM or a share repurchase in the case of the shrink we've already done. All three could potentially be attractive.  Operator Your next question comes from David Goldberg - Morgan Stanley. David Goldberg - Morgan Stanley Just had two on LCAPA, one for Greg kind of following up on James's question there. In terms of the Sprint collar unwind, I just want to clarify, I mean, it seems like there is going to be a relatively large taxable gain there. Should we assume that the cash is, indeed, coming in or are there any strategies that you guys might take to kind of delay the maturity of those or should we just assume that the cash is coming in and you're paying taxes on the gain? Greg Maffei Well, I think you should be assured that the cash is coming in, okay? And I could talk more about that in a moment. On the question of whether the taxes are going out, Liberty is always focused, as you may have heard, on tax efficiency. We have some ideas and strategies around that. I'm not going to tip all of those ideas out today, but we're working that problem. David Goldberg - Morgan Stanley And then on the Starz side, I guess this one's more for Bob. You guys obviously sit in an interesting kind of part of the home video market and I was wondering what you guys are seeing there given what seems like a 10% to 15% decline in home video sell through and whether or not that changes your view of investment in film and entities like Anchor Bay? Bob Clasen The primary decline and it's probably more than 10% to 15% is in the catalog side. Anchor Bay, when we acquired it, was essentially a catalog company, holding Season 7 of Third Rock From the Sun and a lot of older children's titles. So what we've been doing at Anchor Bay is shifting that mix to be first run movies, and if you come back to our comments about Overture, eight to 10\xa0from Overture a year, eight to 10 from Anchor Bay Films, our view is that we will offset our getting out of the catalog business by being much more focused on first run motion pictures which still have a great life.  What we've been seeing and I think some other studios have seen that if you have the right movie for home video and other ways to monetize it, it holds up very well. It's the catalog business that we think is in decline, and that's why this is an awkward year for us as we are not renewing rights for a lot of our catalog product and replacing it with movies that are first run and that generate much higher unit sales Another data point - many of the big box retailers who have a lot of play in home video like WalMart and Best Buy and Target are going through the process of deciding how much space they're going to allocate and also how many people they're going to deal with, and so the more we have focus on first run titles, which they market around to bring people into their stores, I think the better opportunity we have to save our spots in our space, and so far we've suffered no decline from the big box retail people with regard to home video. So it's a challenged space, but our strategy of exiting the catalog business for the most part and replacing that with a fewer number but higher quality titles probably gives us some window to continue to evaluate it while we continue to look for ways to move some of that to digital revenue as well, which is another part of our strategy that's just starting to unfold. David Goldberg - Morgan Stanley And just one follow up for Mike - sorry to tack on here - but I think your previous commentary on QVC's domestic business has been that it kind of bottomed out in terms of sales in September\xa0 October. Does that still seem to be the case or is there any incremental weakness in 1Q? Mike George I think that's still a fair statement. Definitely the sort of last half of September, first half of October were the toughest spot in the quarter, then came off of those lows and somewhat stabilized for the balance of the quarter. You know, I said in our Morgan Stanley call in November, I did say that the unknown was what would happen when we turned the clock on the New Year and got past the Christmas selling season, and so far we feel pretty good that we are off those bottoms and the trend has picked up modestly from those levels. Operator Your next question comes from Jason Bazinet - Citigroup. Jason Bazinet - Citigroup I just have one question on Liberty Capital. I think historically you guys said you've been buying back the LCAPA shares sort of in the low double-digit range, and maybe my math is wrong but I sort of have full liquidation value at something in the high teens. And I guess my question is it seems like while you're buying back shares, it seems like the pace is relatively slow given the cash that still sits as LCAPA, even pro forma, for the SIRIUS investment. And so I guess my question is is that a liquidity issue, that there aren't enough shares trading, or is that more a function of you think that there are other things you can do with that cash to create more value related to the debt or other investments outside of Liberty? Greg Maffei Jason, I think it's first and foremost not a liquidity issue. If you look at the cash at LCAPA relative to the market cap, I agree the cash and potential near cash looks considerably higher. Jason Bazinet - Citigroup I don't mean liquidity in terms of what you have. I just mean in terms of how many shares. Greg Maffei No, I got that. I think there is a relatively thin market. There's no need to chase this stock. It's frankly going to, you know, it's unlikely to be a double-digit stock just because of the way the stock market is acting anytime soon, not related to what - we agree with your fundamental point that the NAV is considerably higher than market. So I think you'll see us - we have some other constraints we're working through and as we get that, we'll evaluate what liquidity in terms of share liquidity, to your point, is out there and look to adjust our pace. Jason Bazinet - Citigroup And can I just go back and just clarify because I heard rumblings about the stimulus provision regarding debt. That rule essentially says if you tender for debt you don't pay capital gains on the difference between market value and par for five years. Is that the right way to think about it? Greg Maffei Well, it's not necessarily tender. If you repurchase debt, the COV income is not recognized for five years and then is recognized ratably for the next five. So on a present value basis you're looking at something like 7.5 years out. With a reasonable discount rate, that's pretty attractive in terms of reducing that present value of that liability. Operator Your next question comes from Thomas Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC. Thomas Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC First on Starz, the programming costs were lower than we had thought and therefore margin was higher. I was wondering, Greg, if you could just give us an outlook on programming costs for 2009 and therefore the margin?  Greg Maffei Bob, do you want to comment on that? Bob Clasen I think we don't give guidance. Programming is so material to our results that I think that would be the right thing to do. I think we've cautioned you that in 2010 we could see the decline stop. And remember, we are increasing our original programming and as that comes to market and we amortize that it's an additional cost. So I think the right thing to comment on is that there could be an increase in 2010; we'll just have to monitor it. But for the time being we're certainly pretty well in a flat position.  Thomas Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC More broadly, I guess, for Greg or for John, is with the declining Q4 fundamentals we've seen across content companies, entertainment companies, and cable and satellite companies\xa0 all except for DIRECTV - I was wondering if you guys could comment on these days what you think about the relative strength of content versus cable and satellite? Greg Maffei Well, no John today. He's not even hiding in the shadows. He's not on the call. So you'll have to take my answer. I think you've seen the case where a lot of people who have ad-based businesses have suffered and particularly those who have local ad-based businesses rather than national have suffered more dramatically. And probably the most suffering in that group when you look at who their advertisers are is obviously newspapers and local television stations because an enormous percentage of their ad revenue is based on car dealers, particularly domestic car dealers given the number of domestic car dealers per dollar of sales as well as the foreign car dealers and people like department stores and you can go through the list, financials, etc., though they're more national as well. So that's been the most suffering. Then you look at, say, subscription businesses have had a relative strength compared to them. And then within that someone like DIRECTV, who's carved out a niche among the most attractive of those potential subscribers, sort of the iron triangle that they were able to execute on with HD, sports content, other kinds of unique content, large screen TVs, that's all worked very well. DVRs, that has worked very well for them.  Will that continue through 2009? They certainly look to have a good tailwind and it does not appear to be abating. We'll see. It's been less true for others, who've seen some substitution both on video subscribers and now slowdowns in data services as that's gotten more competitive and competition with wireless potentially slowing VoIP, the VoIP transition. So for the moment we've been lucky.  When you go to content in terms of what does that look like, it seems to me that the rich will get richer and the poor will be hurt, meaning if your content is very valuable and your content is very strong and you're able to in effect have A level, A plus content, which has the leverage against the distributor, your hand will strengthen because you now have only further means of distributing that content, which over time will give you more strength.  If you have weaker content and maybe there's demand for it online, maybe not, you may be more reliant upon the packager, and the packager may decide that they - or the distributor may decide that they need to hold their margins flat. For what they have to give the A level content, they need to take it out of the D and C level content. And I think that trend only gets exacerbated in an environment where dollars are tight. Thomas Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC Do you think it means anything in terms of the affiliation fees that the cable and satellite companies, again, maybe more specifically on DIRECTV, do you think it will help them to not incur the same kind of increases that we'll see elsewhere? Greg Maffei I think DIRECTV's relative growth and strength will help them in all of their negotiations, that they are able to talk about increases is subscribers is more positive for their ability to negotiate with content providers than people who do not have increases in subscribers.  That having been said, they will be doing what I suspect all our distributors are doing\xa0 trying to get the best deal possible, but frankly they will take more of that best deal out of the hides of Tier\xa02 content than out of Tier 1 content. Operator Your next question comes from [Matthew Harrigan - Wonderlit Securities]. Matthew Harrigan - Wonderlit Securities I had a couple questions. Firstly, I was curious if Greg would be comfortable commenting more on how they view SIRIUS strategically in light of what's happening with the OEMs right now and maybe even the prospects for bundling with DIRECTV at some point or maybe even using some of the repeaters for some other purposes, which I suspect isn't very likely, but I thought I'd still ask. And then secondly, I guess another really good swap you made was the IDT shares for the entertainment assets. They talked a lot about their animation engines. They had a couple of small theatrical releases that didn't do much. I'm curious if you could talk more about what happens prospectively with animation. Is there some interstitial programming possibilities for Starz? Would you ever do another theatrical release?  And then lastly, you've commented on the possibilities for more ecommerce deals. I was curious if you could do some interesting things at QVC as well, either taking more equity interest in products than you've done in the past. I know there's some restrictions with HSN as to what you could do, but I was curious also if you could do anything on the M&A side with somebody like [Carl Shockvella] in Germany or someplace else? Greg Maffei Okay, a couple of different topics there.  So on SIRIUS, I'm not sure it's strategic. Obviously, a lot of these OEM deals, just like a lot of these content deals, were cut in an environment where two players - SIRIUS and XM - were bidding and there's certainly more than anecdotal evidence that in many cases they overpaid because of the prospects of the two people bidding aggressively. Some have suggested that a bankruptcy would be positive for that company in terms of re-cutting those OEM deals, recutting some of those content deals, and obviously resetting the capital structure.  We believe that SIRIUS has a very good chance to grow its way in and renegotiate those contracts, as they are doing in many cases, and, as certain contracts mature, reset those contracts at attractive levels such that it will be able to build equity value for its shareholders. Obviously in the event that it does not happen and some of those things are not successful - and it could be in part related to how the domestic car market grows or does not grow - we took a position in the senior debt which we believe is relatively secure against the downside possibility. We're rooting for the upside; we're hoping Mel is as successful as he can be at doing some of these things, but we are positioned okay, we believe, if that does not come to pass.  In terms of the bundling, we certainly see those as opportunities down the road. One can talk about or imagine bundles, particularly probably the $80-plus DIRECTV product offering free trials of the $11 SIRIUS XM product more likely than the other way around, just given the dollar value of the customers and the subscriber value. I certainly think those are things that we have talked about and surmised. We did put a lot in our valuation for that, but it's something that Mel is enthused about, it's something I believe Chase is enthused about, and I hope we'll be able to proceed on some of those in ways that are obviously beneficial for both parties. On the larger technical questions, I think things about space segments and repeaters and those are sort of in the future. The great dream perhaps is that you have 25 megahertz of spectrum that you're able to broadcast and as compression gets better even more, 150 audio channels on one consolidated SIRIUS XM platform that only consumed 12.5 megahertz of spectrum and 12.5\xa0megahertz becomes therefore available for mobile video, and that would be a great intersection of where the skills of SIRIUS XM and DIRECTV reside.  That's a long way down the road and highly speculative. There is no plan currently to merge the SIRIUS and XM platforms. There's a whole bunch of technical issues around the quality of that video that is likely to be. There's something that SIRIUS XM already does, particularly in things like the cartoon space, that are interesting, but to really expand that in the mobile video space, we'll see. That's the grand and glorious future we can only hope comes to pass, but we didn't put a lot of stock in that when we did our evaluation. On IDT and animation, we have certain animation assets and studios like Film Roman that have\xa0been - some of the things we do there that are interesting and have quite a lot of capabilities in the animation space. But as far as entering theatrical or really expanding that, we think the theatrical animation space is a very competitive space with people like Pixar and DreamWorks who are very good and make very big bets, and that's probably not our strategy or where we're likely to go in terms of animation releases.  The strategy, as we've said, is to use our engine of Starz Entertainment, to use a relatively more contained cost model of Overture, and distributing our own films around Anchor Bay, using it to try and capture as much of the revenue stream of the things that we produce and leverage the revenue streams we know we have rather than making the larger bets in animation. And what we have is quite good in animation and that's a useful set of tools, but it's probably not - to make a great animated film you need that plus a great story plus a willingness to promote and spend a hell of a lot of money which, as I said, Pixar and DreamWorks do well and we're a little scared of. In ecommerce we're certainly looking for extensions and things to do around both QVC and elsewhere. QVC, for example, this year has just launched on a sort of beginning basis its efforts with its own ODAT - Handbag Chique - and you should definitely go take a look for your wife or maybe yourself if you have other interests. There'll be a little laugh tittering around the room here. Other interests, you know, other things that we do in trying to spin ecommerce is interesting, but I also think we're going to see cases where ecommerce players who are not as strong do drop out and we have an opportunity to either fill in the space or purchase those companies. And we will certainly look to that.  And as far as HSN, we are restrained, I guess, until I think it's May of 2011 from making any kind of an offer for the company as a whole. We have the opportunity to increase our - May 2010, excuse me; somebody's rightly correcting me, thank you - 2010 before we make any kind of offer for the company as a whole. I'm not saying that we will, but we do believe we are the natural probably owner at some point of that company. We're the one with the most synergies. And we also have the right to increase our stake in the company from 30% to roughly 35%, and we'll monitor the time and place to do that. Matthew Harrigan - Wonderlit Securities Great.
