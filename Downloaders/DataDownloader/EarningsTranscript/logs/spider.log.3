Operator Good morning and welcome to the American Airlines Group First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operation Instructions] And now, we would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead, sir. Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room with us for the Q&A session is Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications; Bev Goulet, our Chief Integration Officer; Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; and Don Casey, our Senior VP of Revenue Management. Like we normally do, we're going to start the call with Doug and he will provide us an overview of our first quarter 2017 results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment and then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions and, lastly, questions from the media. But before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning revenue, our future revenues and costs, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found on our website at aa.com. A webcast of this call will be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us, and at this point, we'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks a lot, Dan. Thanks, everybody, for being on the call. This morning, we reported our pre-tax earnings excluding special items of $491 million. We are extremely excited about the near and long-term prospects for American Airlines and our shareholders. We are in the midst of transforming American through investments in our product and our team and it is working. Our unit revenues are increasing at a faster rate than our competition and the outlook is strong. Robert will talk more about that in a minute. Before that, I just want to talk a little bit about an initiative we put in place last night. Many of you have heard us talk about the mission at American, which is to validate the trust that is placed in us. That is a trust our customers place in us and when they choose American for their travel, and it's a trust all of you put in us when you select American as an investment choice. And at American, building trust for us starts first with our own team. We announced yesterday something that impacts our expenses, but it's also a very important step as we rebuild trust at American with our team. The announcement yesterday was that we would make mid-contract pay increases for our pilot and flight attendant groups. It's an unprecedented move because those two groups have close to two years left on their existing contracts and to the best of our knowledge, something like this has never been done in our industry. And so therefore, it's a move that might surprise or even dismay some of you because it adds costs to the airline. We couldn't be more convicted about doing it and here's why. When we merged, we knew we were creating not only the largest airline in the world, but we set out to build the best. And that's best defined by a global network, a best-in-class product and an engaged and enthusiastic team. With our industry profoundly changed, we made a commitment when we merged, the new American would have pay rates for our team that were at or near the top of our competitor's pay rates. And I'm happy to report that we've lived up to that commitment in every joint contract we negotiated thus far. Also, the reason last fall, in spite of not having reached an agreement for our mechanics and fleet service workers, we moved their pay rates to industry leading rates in an unprecedented move as those contract negotiations have continued. But it's the right move for the new American. So we're going to keep leading this way because it's the right way to lead any service organization and certainly the right way to lead American Airlines. There's a history at American that's bred some mistrust, and we're working hard to change that culture, and the team is making great progress in that regard. We recognize pay alone won't build trust, but we also know it's an important step in the right direction. As outlined in our 8-K last night, the expense add is about $350 million annually for something less than two years – I'm sorry, less than – a little over two years, as our contracts were amendable at the end of 2019 and early 2020. That's certainly a lot of money of our shareholders but in the bigger picture and taking the longer view, as a service organization, investments in our team are investments in our product. And the leverage at American today is in closing our unit revenue gap, and we believe this is an investment that will help us do that and therefore help our shareholders. We think it's precisely this kind of investment in our people is going to make the difference in our service, and while this won't happen overnight, we also think it's the kind of investment that will continue to drive revenue outperformance for American. And as that happens, all of you will be the beneficiaries of those returns. So in closing, we're tightening the revenue gap quickly, and our investments to accomplish this are going to continue. Because we work for all of you, you can be assured we're using your money to create an airline for the long-term. We couldn't be more excited about our prospects. And now, I'll turn it to Derek for the financials and then Robert will talk more specifically about how we're doing in the operation and in our revenue progress. Derek? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to thank our 120,000 team members who continue to do an exceptional job of taking care of our customers. Because of their hard work, our integration efforts and financial performance have been outstanding. As Doug mentioned, we filed our earnings press release this morning. In that release, our first quarter 2017 GAAP net profit was $234 million, or $0.46 per diluted share. This compares to our first quarter 2016 GAAP net profit of $700 million or $1.14 per diluted share. Excluding special items, we reported a net profit of $308 million in the first quarter 2017, or $0.61 per share versus first quarter 2016 net profit of $765 million or $1.25 per diluted share. The significant year-over-year decline in earnings is due primarily to a 37.8% or $472 million increase in first quarter 2017 consolidated fuel expense. Our GAAP first quarter 2017 pre-tax profit was $365 million. Excluding net special items, our first quarter pre-tax profit was $491 million, resulting in a pre-tax margin of 5.1%. Our revenue performance continued to improve in the first quarter 2017 as total operating revenues were up 2% year-over-year to $9.6 billion. Passenger revenues were $8.2 billion, up 0.8% on a yield improvement of 2.4%. This marks the third consecutive quarter that our unit revenue performance has been the best of the six largest U.S. carriers. Robert will give more detail on our revenue performance later on the call after I'm done. Cargo revenues were up 6.3% to $172 million due primarily to higher volume. Other operating revenues were $1.3 billion, up 9.3% versus the same period last year due primarily to revenue associated with our new credit – co-branded credit card agreements. Total GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $9 billion, up 11.4% versus the same period last year due primarily to higher fuel prices and salaries and benefit expense resulting from the investment in our team. Had our first quarter 2017 fuel prices been flat to last year's $1.21 per gallon, our consolidated fuel expense would have been approximately $500 million lower. First quarter CASM was $0.1402, up 12.6% year-over-year. Excluding fuel and special items, our consolidated CASM was $0.1116, or up 7.6% year-over-year due primarily to salaries and benefits, increases provided to our team members, which is about worth three points, higher depreciation and amortization resulting from increased CapEx in our aircraft – new aircraft, about a point, and maintenance timing of about a point. We ended the quarter with approximately $9.1 billion in total available liquidity, comprised of cash and investments of $6.7 billion and $2.4 billion of an undrawn revolver capacity. The company also has restricted cash position of $543 million. During the quarter, our treasury team raised $983 million to finance 24 aircraft deliveries at a fixed rate blended cost of 3.93%. We also re-priced $1.8 billion term loan at an industry leading rate of LIBOR plus 200 [bps]. In addition, we also closed two private mortgage transactions to finance four more aircraft. In the first quarter of 2017, the company returned $563 million to its shareholders, including quarterly dividend payments totaling $51 million and the repurchase of $512 million of common stock or 11.7 million shares. Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee share distributions and equity awards and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped by over a third from 500 – excuse me, 756.1 million at merger close in December 2013 to 495.7 million shares as of March 31. The company did declare a dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid on May 30, 2017, to stockholders of record as of May 16, 2017. In April, we also made a $279 million contribution to the company's defined benefit plans, of which only $25 million was required, which are now fully – the plans are now fully funded as of April 17, 2017 under the Airline Relief Act. In addition to our earnings release, we also filed our investor update this morning. Consistent with our previous guidance in the second quarter of 2017, we expect our system-wide ASM growth to be up approximately 1.5%. For the full year, we expect consolidated system capacity to be up approximately 1.5% and domestic consolidated capacity to be up approximately flat year-over-year. We expect international capacity to be up approximately 4%, primarily due to the continuing impact of the 777-200 retrofit program and the year-over-year impact of new Pacific markets that we added in 2016. Over the past two years, we have made significant investment in our people, our product and our operation. And as Doug discussed in his remark, we are offering mid-year contract, hourly base pay rate adjustments of approximately 5% to our flight attendants and an average of 8% to our pilots. The estimated pre-tax income on the company's 2017 salary and benefits expense would be approximately $230 million in 2017 and $350 million in 2018 and 2019. So those are numbers that come off the base that we are at today. So the total impact is $350 million. We are happy to be able to fulfill the commitment we made to our team members and continue to believe these investments are vital to improving our product and operation. With these pay rate adjustments, we now expect our second quarter of 2017 year-over-year consolidated CASM, excluding special items to be up approximately 7%. The mainline is in the range of 6% to 8%, and the regional is in the 3% to 5% range. We continue to expect higher year-over-year fuel prices in 2017, based on the forward curve as of April 24. We expect to pay between $1.63 and $1.68 per gallon consolidated in the second quarter of 2017, which is approximately 16% higher year-over-year. Using the midpoints of the guidance we just provided along with Robert's revenue guidance, we expect our second quarter 2017 pre-tax margin, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 13%. For the full year, we expect gross aircraft CapEx to total $4.1 billion. This includes the delivery of 57 mainline aircraft and 16 regional aircraft, while retiring 46 mainline aircraft and reducing the overall regional fleet count by 9 aircraft. In addition, we expect to invest $1.6 billion in non-aircraft CapEx, which includes projects to improve our product and operations, as well as investments to complete our integration. With respect to our fleet, we announced in our release this morning that we reached a new amended agreement with Airbus to defer delivery of the 22 A350 XWB aircraft the company has on order. Under the new amended delivery schedule, we expect to take delivery of the first two A350 aircraft in late 2020 instead of 2018, as previously expected. We now expect to take delivery of these A350s from 2020 through 2024 with an average deferral of 24 months. In addition, we also reached agreement with Boeing to defer the delivery of two 787-9 aircraft from the second quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019. These changes, as well as the impact of changes to net pre-delivery payments, reduced the company's planned capital expenditures by approximately $500 million in 2018 and approximately $300 million in 2019 and 2020 and provides us with additional wide body capacity flexibility. So in conclusion, our team produced outstanding results in the first quarter and we look forward to more of the same as we move into the peak summer travel period. I would like to, again, thank our 120,000 team members for the great service they provide to our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Robert. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Derek. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. I would like to start by recognizing our 120,000 employees. My colleagues have done outstanding work over the quarter and we've asked a lot of them over the last few years and they've really delivered. The first three months of the year, we saw continued improvement across the enterprise, including operational improvements, fleet refresh, customer experience and team member engagement. We continue to make smart long-term investments in things like customer service training, facilities improvements for both our employees and customers and technology to improve the overall customer experience. These investments are starting to pay real dividends, and we're really excited about the trajectory that we're on. Our operation continued to take big steps for the first quarter. Despite the impact of Winter Storm Stella in March, which disrupted the operations at stations in the Southeast, Mideast and Northeast, American team members set new post-merger operational records in February for mainline, on-time departures, on-time arrivals and mishandled baggage. We had eight days without a single mainline cancellation in the first quarter, which is more than any year that we've had since the merger. These accomplishments demonstrate our progress in creating a consistently reliable operation for our customers and team members. While much of the integration work is already complete, there's several noteworthy projects in the works that will refine our network and make us even stronger for our customers. Some of these projects include the March announcement of new service to eight cities from our hub in Chicago, as well as one new route in Dallas-Fort Worth and Miami. None of these 10 new additions will serve cities that have flights to other American hubs and have historically performed well. In addition, the bank patterns at our Miami hub have been redesigned to facilitate better connections, more efficient gate utilization and faster processing through customs and immigration. One critical part of refining the network is focusing on the areas where we can maximize the value of our resources and we're building up service in profitable cities, improving the efficiency of the scheduling process and making structural changes at our hubs. These are just a few of the examples of how we're striving to invest our resources to create a seamless operation for our team members, the best product for our customers and the highest return for our owners. On the commercial side, we rolled out the new Basic Economy product in 10 test markets in early March with encouraging results. In the 10 launch market, half of the eligible Basic Economy passengers have bought up to the main cabin, which is right in line with our forecast. We plan to continue to roll the product out to the remainder of our domestic and short haul international markets in a phased approach with more markets coming in May and June. At the end of March, we started selling Premium Economy with our first departures on May 4. We expect to have nine widebody aircraft configured with Premium Economy by the second quarter and more as time comes in the future. We also announced an agreement to invest $200 million in China's largest carrier, China Southern Airlines. Later this year, we expect to begin codeshare and interline agreements that will give our customers approximately 70 more destinations in China, beyond Beijing and Shanghai. Lastly, we entered into an arrangement with Scandinavian Airlines to obtain two slot pairs at London's Heathrow Airport, strengthening American's presence at a key international gateway for American and our joint business partner, British Airways. Turning to revenue, we're very pleased with the revenue performance in the first quarter. Our first quarter consolidated PRASM was up 2%, and our first quarter TRASM was up 3.1%. This is the third consecutive quarter where our unit revenue performance was materially better than the rest of the industry. And not just the industry average, but better than each of the six largest U.S. carriers. We believe that this outperformance can be attributed to the significant investments we've made in many years of business from our people to our product and to selling, revenue management, our AAdvantage program and our mobile platform and aa.com. And customers are noticing. We recorded our highest customer satisfaction rating since the merger, the fifth consecutive month of sequential improvement. And last week, the Harris Poll named American Airlines its Full Service Airline Brand of the Year. And earlier this year, American was named the 2017 Airline of the Year by Air Transport World. Turning to domestic, our consolidated PRASM was up 2.3% and importantly, improved in every month in the quarter. We have been implementing a number of revenue management initiatives for the Premium cabin and they have proven very successful. Our sales initiatives are also bearing fruit. We continue to see a positive trend in corporate share in the first quarter with strong results across the network. This trend is continuing as we enter the second quarter as well. Our Latin America performance overall was very strong, with PRASM up 7.7%. Although Brazil led the way, up 43%, strength (20:14) broad-based also. The balance of South America had positive unit revenue growth as well, while other areas within the region had low single digit declines. The Atlantic was our weakest performing international entity with PRASM down 5.9%, but that number overstates the decline in actual performance. It requires some explanation. While our results did decline as a result of industry growth in a soft pricing environment, half of the decline that we saw is due to an out of period adjustment that positively impacted last year's results. And another point and a half is due to the decline in UK currency and our exposure to that. Across the Pacific, PRASM was positive. This is the first positive result since the third quarter of 2014 and is a sign that we're turning the corner around our capacity build-out in the Pacific. We expect this region to continue to improve as we lap the additions of Haneda, Sydney, Auckland and Hong Kong throughout the year. First quarter cargo revenue improved 6.3% year-over-year on strong growth, a positive trend that we've seen since the latter half of 2016. The focus that our cargo team members have placed on improving cargo's operational performance and efforts to deliver best-in-class customer experience are paying off and being recognized by the industry. American Airlines Cargo was voted Air Cargo News 2017 Cargo Airline of the Year for the third straight year. And American is the only U.S. based carrier to have been recognized with this honor in the award's 34-year history. So looking forward, the revenue environment at American is very strong, and we expect this momentum to continue. The June quarter will mark the sixth quarter in a row of sequential improvement unit revenue and the third consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth. Based on published guidance, we expect to outperform the industry in the second quarter as well, for the fourth quarter in a row. We continue to expect positive revenue improvements for each quarter throughout this year. Regionally, our domestic PRASM is expected to strengthen in the quarter due to a number of initiatives focused on Premium cabin pricing and yield management and continuing gains through our investments in our sales organizations. In Latin America, we expect another quarter of strong year-over-year improvements with every entity having positive unit revenue. The Pacific entity is expected to perform in line with the first quarter. Lastly, the Atlantic region has continued to show modest signs of improvement due to easing comps from past terror events. However, it remains challenged, as low priced carriers continue to grow and the British pound remains weak. As we look to the second quarter and beyond, we're excited about our operational commercial investments, and we expect our second quarter total revenue for ASM to be up 3% to 5% year-over-year. We rolled out our new Basic Economy product, our Premium Economy product as well, and early results are encouraging. While we have a lot of work to do, we look forward to reporting on future successes. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin our Q&A. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operation Instructions] And we will take our first question from Kevin Crissey with Citi. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hello, Kevin. Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Can you provide evidence that cultural investments are more than recouped through higher revenue? Having worked at JetBlue, I can assure you that investors are unconvinced by this argument. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yeah. Kevin, what I'm certain of is that we – the leverage in this airline is in closing the revenue gap that we have. And I'm equally certain that our ability to do that, while asking our team to work for less than their peers is a big challenge and one that I'm certain either is fair to our team nor to our leadership because it makes it increasingly difficult. So I don't know that I can directly answer your question but I'm highly confident that it is correlated. And would note, again, this isn't about us making a bet that, oh, if we can go get to rates that are – pay levels that are higher than others, that will get us something that will allow us to generate higher revenues than others. I don't think I would make that argument. This is about us getting our team to the levels that are currently in place at our competitor airlines and consistent with the commitment we made to our team at the time of the merger that we would compensate them in line with their peers at other airlines, a commitment again that we've made consistently with each and every contract. But in the case of these two contracts that were done shortly after the merger and were put in place on five-year terms, which is also worth noting, longer terms than the other airlines are putting in place today. It just got to where the gap was too big and it was going to be in place for too long and that didn't feel right to any of us. So I feel good about that commitment. It's a commitment we're happy to make, not just in this case, but to any of the rest of our team to the extent we see large discrepancies in our pay rates, our base pay rates versus competitors, other airlines and there's still significant amount of time and we can get that addressed through contract negotiations. You should expect us to correct it because that's the right thing to do for our team and I think – and I do believe, Kevin, what happens so long as we do that, we have an engaged and excited team that is seeing the trust they placed in us validated and they go take care of our customers and that's the best way to take care of our shareholder. Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. But isn't this taking your number one cost item and handing it over to the most aggressive competitor effectively? Whoever thinks that they can pay the most goes out and signs a contract and your labor rates are going to go to that optimistic or arguably the dumbest management team out there is an argument investors could look at. You've taken it out of your hands and put it in the hands of others and that doesn't feel like what well run companies do. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, I would beg to differ. Again, given the experience levels here, and what our teams have been through. And look, we're comfortable with the commitment. You're right, in one sense, I suppose, that if you want to look at our commitment and figure out what it means for the industry, the answer is you've got to go ask others in the industry because we're, indeed, not leading this charge. We're just making sure we're staying – we're catching up. So where it goes in the future will be dependent on what others do in the future. But look, I feel, I think again, I think this is – what you're seeing here is the maturing of an industry and an industry that has seen the people work in this business go through incredibly difficult times and what we needed to have happen was that get corrected. And I think look – and I think it's largely corrected. We were encouraged to hear Delta, apparently at their Investor Day, mentioned that they put in place a 6% pay increase for all their team, for all their non-union members, which at Delta is everyone, I believe, except their pilots and their dispatchers. So the vast majority of the airline they increased 6% again this year but note on their Investor Day they thought that was their last industry reset and they would see inflationary increases in the future. So I don't know that I agree with your premise but I certainly agree with our commitment and that is we're going to make sure, because it's important that our team who is an incredibly important part of our product is excited and engaged. And it's hard to do that if they see others that do the same job they do and don't do it as well at other companies, getting compensated more on an hourly basis. So that's important to us. It will continue to be important. I don't think it's dramatically different than if you saw another airline make some major enhancement to their in-flight product, you would see us match those because it is an important part of making sure that we're taking care of our customers. And these are the people to take care of our customers, the people that are on the frontline, not just our pilots and flight attendants, our mechanics, our fleet service employees, our reservations agents, our gate agents, every single one of them deserves the same commitment and we're happy to make it. Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Kevin. Operator Moving next to Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning, everybody. Doug, you have this plan to achieve pre-tax profits mid-cycle of $5 billion. Over the last year or so, it feels like you may have been retreating from that somewhat. Consensus estimates certainly don't embrace that outcome and now, of course, you're adding additional costs to your internal forecast. When do you think you'll be able to reverse direction and start moving towards that objective? Or are we doing the right thing by kind of just ignoring it? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yeah, Jamie, I think you referenced some comments that we made at your conference and the rest of the group may not know what you're talking about, so let me try. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC Oh, I'm sorry. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. That's quite all right. And I don't know, your conference is so well attended maybe everybody knows exactly what you're talking about but I'll try anyway. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC When it doesn't snow. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, that did make it rough. So look, and importantly, I need to restate it because – I would restate it slightly differently than what you just said. Here's what I said and here's what we do. And it's a really important point so I'm glad you raised it. We believe the – we have a company today that over – on average, over time in today's current environment, should generate pre-tax earnings of around $5 billion. Now, look, it's a volatile business. We all know that. That hasn't changed. While that level of earnings is a number that no one has ever fathomed before, the fact is it's still volatile. So, we think it will average $5 billion over time. We think the better years will look around like $7 billion and the lesser years will look around like $3 billion but over time, we should expect this company can generate over time $5 billion. Now, look, that is not just a statement that we make. That is how we compensate our every one of the employees at American Airlines that get an annual bonus, so everyone essentially manager level and above. That's why this is important. We use that formula I just said to fund our annual incentive pool, and we've done that since the merger. Now again, the $3 billion and $7 billion have moved around a little bit as we've gotten more comfortable with post-merger earnings, but the $5 billion hasn't changed since the day of the merger. And maybe it will change one day but we're not changing it – we're certainly – nothing about what we're seeing today leads us to believe that should change. So that's what I reported to you all is that – that's what we think about the earnings prospects of this company. And not only do we think that, that's how we fund our incentive pool. So, again, the way the incentive pool works, not that you care that much about our executive compensation, but I think it's really important to what you think about our expectations for the business. We fund the incentive pool by telling the team, look, if we have a year where we make $5 billion, we're going to fund the incentive pool at target. If we have a year where we make $3 billion, we're going to fund it at half of target, below that, there's no bonus. And if we have a year where we make $7 billion that's the maximum, which is double the bonus. So – and you're right, no one on the Street, I think, is forecasting $5 billion for American this year. But we didn't change that formula for the team. So this – if indeed the Street is right, this will be one of those years that's slightly worse. And there will be years in the future that are slightly better. What's important about this point is that if we are right, and, again, we're not just throwing out numbers here. This is how we're incentivizing our management team. If we're right, our stock is so undervalued it defies logic in my view. If we're right, and this company is going to – over time going to average $5 billion pre-tax, really easy – really simple math and you guys are a lot better at this than me, but I'll go to the simple math, $5 billion taxed is $3 billion, $3 billion and for a company today that is trading at somewhere around – has a market cap of about $24 billion, that's eight times what I'm telling you I think is our steady state earnings. Eight times steady state earnings when the average S&P company over the last 20-something years has had a multiple of earnings of something like, help me, Dan, 19 times. Feels like people don't believe the $5 million (sic) [$5 billion] (34:05) number. And that's fine. But we do. So that's why we're so bullish on the company. And the investments we've made today only strengthen that view. We don't look at that and think, oh, gosh, now it's $300 million harder to get to $5 billion. We look at this and say this reinforces our view that we're going to continue the momentum we have in improving the revenues by these investments we're making, and we feel even better about that in the long-term. So that's what I said, and that's what we still believe. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC As part of that, it looks like it still takes considerably more American employees to get the job done than at Delta. And it's tough for me to accurately do that analysis. There's some outsourcing issues we have to account for, but there do seem to be opportunities for American to become more efficient, and your letter last night seems to imply as much but maybe that's just my interpretation. Can you quantify the opportunity to improve labor efficiency? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, look, I would say this. When you say it's difficult for you to do that, I would argue it's almost impossible for you to compare those numbers. There are enormous differences in the amount of work that American does in-house versus what some other airlines do outside. So you wouldn't see it in the head count or in the salaries, you'd see it, instead, in their numbers and their outside services, and we try to do similar analysis and you can't get there, I don't think. But I'll tell you this, as is the case in most mergers, when you're running two airlines, you need to have some redundancies in place that as you get through the merger, you can eliminate, and we still have some of that in place. But rather than trying to quantify it, because I don't know that we know what it is yet and/or how we're going to manage it and over what period of time, I would just point you to the guidance that Derek rattled off on our cost trends. We had CASM ex fuel in the first quarter here of 8%. The second quarter we say 6% to 8%. The third quarter we say 3% to 5%. Fourth quarter we say 2% to 4%. That includes – again, those estimates include this adjustment that we made last night. So that's a rapidly declining year-over-year increase in cost. And while we're in no position to start giving 2018 guidance yet, I would certainly expect that that trend would continue into 2018 and that is that number of 2% to 4%. And fourth quarter 2017 would be even lower for the full year of 2018. So it's coming down. The rate of growth is certainly slowing. But look, we recognize that our job is to make sure we're running the airline efficiently, and we believe we're doing so today. There are some things that because we're still running in some cases two separate airlines that may have us doing that less efficiently than we'll be able to do over time, but we'll make sure we get there as quickly as we possibly can. I think you'll start to see most of that in 2018 and, again, nothing to report now on how big that will be because I don't think we know. I know we don't know because I don't know. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Yeah. Doug, I appreciate you taking my questions this morning. Thanks. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Jamie. Operator We'll go next to Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good morning, everyone. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Andrew. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Doug, on that note, in terms of the $5 billion, kind of, run rate pre-tax earnings, I guess, when you consider that, and given the permanent step-up in labor, does it change your view at all of capital allocation? With these higher fixed costs, would you consider more debt pay-down over share repurchases going forward? And if not, why? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. The short answer is no. And again, I come back to the overriding point, which is this increase in our near-term expenses in no way changes our view about our long-term prospects. Indeed, it gives us more confidence that they're achievable. So nothing about this makes us think anything about – and, again, let me make one other point on that because this seems to be a theme – a recurring theme that I'm having trouble getting across. We look at this longer term than – and on the long-term, this was an expense that was coming. There's no way when we got to 2020 and did new contracts, of course, that we're going to go sign new contracts with our team that were going to keep in place this sort of a gap. So we accelerated an expense. Again, not something we do lightly and not something we had to do, something we thought we should do. But none of this, to us, feels like any sort of change in the long-term prospects, and when we think about things like share repurchase and capital allocation, we think about it in the long-term. So no, no change in that. We're really confident with our current capital allocation. We think we're doing the right thing for our shareholders, we're happy yet again, as Derek noted, to make some purchases in the quarter that were a good bit less than the price at least as we opened today, and so we feel good about that. We think we – another thing worth noting again on the capital allocation piece is, yeah, our debt is higher, but it's because our assets are better. Another point that I think sometimes gets lost, maybe our fault for not mentioning it enough, but this higher levels in debt versus our competitors is driven by the fact that we have a much younger fleet, and that fleet is a lot more valuable. There's a fleet they have in place and that drives higher debt, of course. So we feel good about the capital allocation, and we will continue to do what's best for our shareholders and our team as we go forward. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it. Understood. I guess, maybe kind of changing gears a little bit, maybe one for Robert. Can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing on the Trans-Atlantic, given kind of this onslaught of low cost carrier capacity into the summer? Have you adapted the way you manage inventory in response to this at all? And kind of what are your expectations for demand on Trans-Atlantic as we head through the summer? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. I'll let Don give some more color. But we're optimistic about what we're seeing close in. But as you note, have concerns about capacity in the long run. Don? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Yes. I mean, we – clearly, there's a lot of capacity growth, and there's a pretty active pricing environment. The industry did a big reset in terms of pricing last year heading into the fourth quarter where we've been more – a bit more aggressive versus low cost carriers. We do have easing comps. So as we go forward, I think we're going to see the comps get a bit easier. We also ran last year at relatively low load factors, U.S. point of sale demand was not as strong as we had hoped last year. Although we're seeing some weakness coming out of the UK, overall, the U.S. point of sale seems very robust this year, and we expect, as we go through the summer that we're going to run materially higher load factors than last year. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thank you, everyone. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks. Operator We'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Hunter. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC Yes. Good morning. So I know, maybe it's a question for Derek, since Derek is the one that made this comment last quarter. I know you said, obviously, it's early to guide to 2018 CASM, but just last quarter you said you think you'd be able to keep CASM ex under 2% over the next couple of years. I'm not sure if you were referring to an average number, or each of the two years? But given the new labor cost increase, do you still feel like that's doable? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, I still feel like that's doable for each of the two years, not just over the two years but for each of the two years. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC All right. Good. And then just to be totally clear, I think, Robert, you said you expect continuing positive improvements in RASM each quarter this year. You weren't saying the 3Q growth rate was going to get better than 2Q or just saying it's going to be above zero, right? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. Do you want to give us maybe an early quick read on how you're thinking about 3Q, anything we should know about in terms of like calendar weirdness, or capacity or anything you're lapping, just to kind of give us an early thought, how to think about that sort of second derivative growth rate? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, there's really – there was a lot of pricing action in the domestic market last year that kind of got sorted out in July that had an impact on some of the bookings through August in particular. October actually was a bit of a weak month for just about everybody last year. But other than that, I think it's nothing stands out as being dramatically impacting the last half of 2017. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Hunter. Operator We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Hey. Thanks. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hi. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Just on the combination of CapEx and pension funding, can you walk us through that this year, 2018 and 2019? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. So in this year, we'll have $4.4 billion in combination, so CapEx of $4.1 billion. Pensions, we did $279 million. In 2018, CapEx – aircraft CapEx is $1.6 billion, and pension right now we're forecasting $1.1 billion. But one thing I want to note on that, that's an assumption that the mortality tables do change. If the mortality tables do not change, that'll be reduced by about $400 million, so we have the most conservative number in there. So it's $1.6 billion in aircraft CapEx and $1.1 billion in pension payments. And then in 2019, aircraft CapEx is $2.8 billion and pension payment is right at a $1 billion. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI And is that $1 billion level – for a longer-term model, is that $1 billion level kind of what we should be thinking about? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, it drops in – in 2020 it drops to $600 million; and 2021, it drops to $600 million. And those are all assuming the mortality table changes. If those don't change, then those could be modified, but it goes down to $600 million in 2020 and 2021, so I'd say the run rate is more $600 million past to the 2019 timeframe. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Okay. And we should add $1.5 billion in non-aircraft to those numbers? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Okay. Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. At least through 2020 and then I think it'll come down to about $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2021. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Thanks for that detail. Have you looked at – I know at least one competitor was able to go into the unsecured market and get very attractive rates to sort of advance fund some of that. Have you analyzed that? Is that something you could even do, given the higher leverage? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. We have analyzed it. We could do it if we want. We think we're – we don't have any requirement to do any payment until 2018 and don't believe we should go forward with that. I think the $1.1 billion we're doing in 2018 will get us to 80% funded which is exactly where one of my competitors went to. So that's the reason we're going to 2018. We only have to do, I think it's $60 million in 2018, so the $1.1 billion is significantly over what we're required to do in order for us to get to that 80% funded once the Airline Relief Act comes off. So, well, it's similar to what they're doing, we just don't need to do it until 2018. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Thanks very much. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Duane. Operator We'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hello. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Good morning. Thanks for the time. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Good morning. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Robert and Don, this'll probably be for you. You – your updated RASM guide points to sequential improvement that's relatively modest versus peers and relative to just what you posted in 1Q, and you've highlighted a lot of revenue opportunities that are impressive out there. What do you think is the driver there in terms of the lack of an acceleration, given all the things that you've got going on? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. I'm not so sure I'd characterize it like that because in all honesty, what we're seeing is a lot of demand for our Premium cabin, and that I think is a sign that the kind of investments that we're making are taking root. We see that strength holding strong forward in the business market and from a business perspective as well. And I think that our outperformance is going to continue. It – we've got a good impressive string here, and that's what we see going forward. Don? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Yes... William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Go ahead, Don. I'm sorry. Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Yeah. I mean, I – first of all, let's not, I guess, confuse guidance with performance. Guidance is guidance and not everybody hits their guidance. So we'll see how the actuals come in when we get through the second quarter. Although on the – from a guidance perspective, this looks like a – sequentially we're not increasing as much. But this will again be the fourth quarter in a row where our performance is better than everybody else's, and so we'll just have to wait and see where the actuals come in, in terms of year-over-year versus others. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yeah. Thanks, Don. That's what I was going to say. And again, the others may meet their guidance and we may exceed our guidance. If you're asking us to forecast the gap versus the others, we're certainly not forecasting that that gap will narrow in the second quarter. We just think we probably have – we may have different biases in our forecasting. Ours might be more conservative than theirs. But if the second quarter actuals come in and that gap closes, that's, I don't know, we'll look at why that happened if that happens, but we certainly don't expect that. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Point taken. And the other question, a bit more nuanced, can you talk about the outlook for the LatAm market? Robert, I think you provided some color for 2Q but I was looking for more, just beyond, as far as puts and takes in regard to supply demand, what South America is looking like, Mexico, Caribbean, et cetera. Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Okay. This is Don. We had, obviously, a very solid first quarter performance in Latin America, Brazil led the way. We had positive unit revenue in all of South America and low single digit declines in the rest of the South America market. As we look forward into the second quarter, we see continuing strength, actually strength improving. And in the second quarter, we expect a positive year-over-year unit revenue in every entity in Latin America that it looks very, very robust at this point. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC And just broader puts and takes as we look beyond 2Q as far as what you're seeing or thinking on the supply side? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. We're not really seeing anything dramatic on the supply side in LatAm, overall. We're seeing affirmative growth in Mexico but we're seeing a lot of demand growth as well, but nothing that we see that's going to change our current outlook. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Very helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator We'll go next to Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Hey, Doug, you've alluded a couple of times to this opportunity to go drive some relative revenue improvement relative to your peers over the next few years. I mean, I guess, I was just hoping that you'd help characterize where do you think the relative revenue discount is coming from today? I mean, is it network or is it on-time performance? And can you help us understand, sort of, what are the components of that you think are addressable versus those that perhaps aren't as addressable? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. I'll let Robert try and do that probably more in terms of the things we think we can do to close as opposed to what drivers are. Go ahead, Robert. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Darryl, I'd just like to point out that I think there are a number of things that are benefiting us that are certainly due to the investments we've been making, but in all honesty a lot of catch-up and I do think is – will benefit us and it's going to be unique to American. Some of the things that are just taking root now, as we've talked about, we are still confident that between our Basic and Premium Economy products that we're talking about a $1 billion worth of incremental revenue, which is sizable. I think everybody – I think you know that we haven't really had a premium product for our widebody long haul flying that's been consistent out in the marketplace. And so, this year we will finally have a lie-flat product across all international entities, which is fantastic. We think that we have some density issues with our narrow body fleet that we will be addressing in the coming years as well that I think will have benefits in terms of overall revenue production and also will help us from a unit cost perspective as well. Don and team have been making improvements in revenue management. And I want to underscore the work that we're doing with our sales team as well. And I'd like to say that a lot of that's baked into the current numbers, but I'm glad that as we look forward that that is just coming on, and we think is going to continue to drive outperformance versus the industry. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC Okay. So you think all that stuff, and I realize that it is difficult to see this, but if you were to take all of that stuff you that just mentioned there, which seem relatively addressable in nature and add them all up that that's enough to offset both the discount, for instance, from Delta that you're achieving today as well as what I'd call probably a positive or relatively positive impact from you already having to do a fleet in the industry. Is that a fair characterization or is there something structural about the network that's also causing you some difficulty? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. When we take a look at the list of initiatives that we are pursuing, we think that that will definitely make us competitive. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thanks very much, guys. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Darryl. Operator And please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. We'll go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Thank you very much. So, Doug, back in 2007 when you were running Airways, you said at the time you were talking to some bankers to get a sense of what the loyalty program could be worth. We've spoken to a couple of guys in private equity and they would use about a 15 times EBITDA multiple on it. That puts the valuation somewhere around $30 billion to $40 billion. Your market cap is half that. So two questions, would that surprise you, that valuation, and if it made sense to see what it was worth back then, why doesn't it make sense to do the same thing now? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, first off, I can't believe I said that in 2007, but if you say I did, okay. This has been an issue, at least from our perspective is it's part and parcel of the airline and part of running the airline and part of inventory management and something that at least in my recollection I've never considered as a particularly good idea to spend out – maybe when we forgot exactly how we financed survival it might have been something we were looking at. But so, anyway, rather than trying to figure out why I said something in 2007, I'll tell you what we think now, which is. Yes. Well, first up to your larger question, would it surprise me to learn that's the value of the advantage program? I would have to say, yes. Because that is greater than the value of American Airlines in total as we sit here today. But I am not arguing with you. You guys are better at doing valuations than we are, and the market will decide. I find it odd that simply separating something that is inside the airline today and putting it into a separate entity with the exact same cash flows would somehow generate that much incremental value, but again, that's something that you guys can figure out better than we can. But actually, I should be careful on that. If we believe that, then of course we would be spending perhaps more effort trying to figure out how to spend it out. What I believe is the advantage program is really valuable. It's an incredible part of our airline. It's a significant reason that we feel so good about our future. And we maximize the value for our shareholders. And whether or not that is done in-house or in a separate entity, that's going to be the case. And the value will be created. So we agree with you, there's a lot of value there. We agree with you that perhaps that's another reason the airline is undervalued, I just think we're undervalued for all sorts of reasons. I think people don't appreciate what's happened in this industry or this airline, and how it's going to make a difference in the long term. And that's where we're focused. As I told you last time, we agree with your pointing this out, and we will continue to try to do a better job of pointing out to investors as best we can the value of the advantage program. But it's part and parcel of the airline and a really important part of the airline and one that we're happy with the way it's being managed and the value it's producing. And it's in our – in the results of the airline today and in the future. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. I mean I guess, Doug, I would just say that the past two years at Jamie's conference, you've made your – making the lead presentation and talked about why there's less cyclicality in the business and the credit card and loyalty program isn't a part of that. So I'm just wondering, do you not mention it because you don't believe that it's an important part of improving cyclicality? Or are you just hesitant to talk about it because it seems like the first rule of having an airline cobrand card is you don't talk about the airline cobrand card? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Okay. Fair enough. It's not that. So, yes, okay, fair enough. We should probably spend a little more time pointing out that that stream of our earnings is a little less volatile than other streams. So noted. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Thanks, Doug. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks. Operator Moving on to Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC Thanks, operator. Hi, team. Thanks for taking the question. As I think about your domestic route network. I know you're focused on Los Angeles, and maybe you can give us a update on facilities and what you're doing there in terms of have the new facilities opening and so on. And then when I think about the growth that's occurring in Fort Lauderdale and the other side of the country, you guys have the big hub in Miami, I get it, in Latin America and so on. But do you worry about the huge increase in capacity an hour and a half north of one of your major, most important hubs and just wondering if you can comment on kind of those two issues? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Steve Johnson will take the LA piece. Stephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc. Sure. Thanks, Helane. Just with respect to facilities in Los Angeles, we – I think everybody knows that earlier this year or late last year, we actually opened the connector between the Bradley Terminal and Terminal 4, which is in use. I got to use it personally just the other day. It's a great way to get from international connection to our domestic service or vice versa. And that's been a big hit with our customers. Then, very recently, we moved our limited operation that was in Terminal 6 to Terminal 5 and to adjacent to the tunnel that goes between Terminal 4 and Terminal 5. So those gates are now much more adjacent and much more convenient for our customers to use. And then finally, we're in negotiations with LAWA for a long-term lease at LAX that will change the face of our facilities there. Those negotiations are confidential beyond that, so I won't say anymore, but we're hopeful that we can get those completed in the next four or five weeks. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. And, Helane, I'll talk a little bit more about South Florida. So, we understand the competition and then also the nature of the markets, and so there's always appropriate consideration. But look, Fort Lauderdale, it's a nice, local market operation. We view Miami differently. We do view it as the ideal connecting opportunity and hub for American, but not just American, of any carrier to the South America. We've got a nice position there. And a lot of the work that we're doing is really to try to maximize the flows and over the long run, we do think that that is something that is going to set us apart. And you may have noticed recently that's actually helped us in markets like Cuba, where we can do things because of the connecting power of the hub, and we're going to continue to make sure that we maximize utility of that operation. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Great. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Helane. Operator Moving next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Michael. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hey. Thanks, guys. Just two quick ones here. Bob, you talked about positive improvement in corporate share when you were talking about domestic PRASM. Any particular sectors or regions where you saw some share gains that you can elaborate on? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. It's Don. I mean, to be honest with you... Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, Don. Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. We saw improvement across the board for our – in corporate markets. And this, again, marks a kind of high-water mark for us since the merger. And in the first quarter, we had our best performance in terms of both share and share gap, and our trends heading into second quarter are also very strong. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay, great. And then just second, just a clarification on the CapEx deferral to Derek. Is that – so is that $800 million or $1.1 billion? I'm not sure if it's $300 million in two years or $300 million per year? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. $300 million per year. So it's $1.1 billion over the three years. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Perfect. Thanks. Operator Savi Syth with Raymond James has our next question. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey. Good morning. A question on the – in the last few years, I think American has been a little bit more exposed to some areas that have seen greater pressure, be it South America, be it some of the aggressive pricing on low-cost carrier markets, and we are seeing that reverse. I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on how much more we could see, or how much more there is to go? And maybe some that might not come back in the near-term? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Okay. I mean, basically clearly we had some kind of unique headwinds that affected us, right? The Southwest growth at Love Field, the OCC growth Brazil, Venezuela. But we really kind of came out from under all that at the end of the second quarter of last year. And so, Brazil's clearly one area where we're seeing some year-over-year improvement, but the rest of that really doesn't really drive any year-over-year change. So the real value we're seeing and the uptick in our revenue performance, although Brazil is a piece of that, it's really being driven by all of the other initiatives we have out there in the marketplace. It's the new airplanes, it's the new product, it's the restructuring of our Advantage program, it's the investment we're making in sales, and the investment and change we're making in revenue management. All the things we're doing, which is a long list, right, is really what's driving the benefit. It's not just some lucky, fortunate year-over-year comparison. It's really kind of fundamental, the fundamentals that are getting better for us. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Sorry. And I meant, not necessarily a comparison issue but maybe a reversal issue of some of the pressures that you saw. Finally a follow-up on Mike's question on corporate, was – are we seeing corporate revenue and yields up now year-over-year? Is that firmly in that trend? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Actually in the fourth quarter we did see yields come up. In the first quarter of this year, we saw yields actually for corporate flattish. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thanks very much. Operator Moving on to Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Just kind of going back to comments earlier around the revenue initiatives, specifically some initiatives around improving the density on the narrow body fleet. Can you just expand on that for a moment in terms of when you think that could begin to impact results and sort of the opportunity there? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. So those are things that we look at on an ongoing basis. And again, some of the things that you will see showing up is the work that we've done with our wide body, our 777 reconfiguration program where we're moving to a standard configuration. So that's on that front. And we think that there's opportunities with the narrow bodies as well. And that is something that you'll see in 2018 and beyond. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Okay. And then just kind of following up on that as well. Thinking about your prepared comments on Basic and Premium Economy, just sort of curious if you could update us in terms of how you're thinking about the portion of your domestic flights that will have those two additional classes of service on them by year-end. And then, just what sort of revenue impact that's expected to have in the back half of the year as comps perhaps get a little bit more challenging? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. So in terms of Basic, that's something that we anticipate for – it will be something that we offer throughout our network. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Yes. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. So for Basic, it's really just the timing of the rollout for us, right? So, we have more markets coming in May and June. These are still, I guess, I would view as kind of test markets, the next two tranches similar to the first tranche. But we're going to end up expanding this broadly across the whole network eventually, right, and pacing item for that is really going to be our training and staffing. But we're committed to roll this out everywhere, and we're quite encouraged by the initial results. Premium Economy is the next thing. And we don't really kind of get to a critical mass of airplanes on our roll-out of Premium Economy probably until we get in first quarter of next year. So we still kind of consider what we're doing right now kind of a test, and we're very focused on this. A lot of it is channel education. We're the first U.S. airline to have this product, and so we need to make sure that all of our distribution, all of our selling channels know what the product is. And we need to make sure we work with our third-party distributors as well to make sure that the product is being appropriately displayed in all the systems, so people will understand what it is and what they're buying. And that's what we're focused on right now for Premium Economy. But, again, it will be critical mass by the first quarter of next year. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Okay. Thanks again for the time. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks. Operator And Brandon Oglenski with Barclays has our next question. Sorry. Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research has our next question. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Dan. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys. Doug, help us understand why the $5 billion pre-tax target is realistic from your perspective. You're saying it's the right hurdle for executive compensation, and I know you. You're not pulling that out of thin air. Why is that? So from where you sit, what are the larger revenue opportunities over the cycle that gives you confidence you can offset the labor headwinds this morning, and what are the new initiatives worth over the coming one to two years? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. I think Robert laid those out pretty well. He can lay them out again for you, if you'd like, as to what the initiatives are. And as to the value themselves, we mentioned that as well. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Basic and Premium Economy we mentioned. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Right. So look, that is the value that gives us confidence. All you need to do is look at the current gap in revenue per ASM as soon as we close that, you easily get to numbers like $5 billion as a run rate number. So, look, but that's not how we go about coming up with this number. The way we come up with this number is knowing what we do about where the industry is today and where American Airlines is positioned in that industry, both of which we feel good about and both of which feel dramatically different than they've ever been before. And based upon that view, that's what this feel – that's what the company feels like to us. I don't want to portend or pretend that we go and that – those numbers I said to you are the basis of some enormous analysis that's laid out for the next 15 years. It's where we believe this company is today. And look, the facts support it. Since the time of the merger, we have had earnings in that range. This is a worse year than others, and it's still in the range. One of the things I do like to point out to people when they – part of the reason – part of the explanation, at least, I get sometimes, Dan, from investors as to why it is even if you believe what we – why it is that that we are so undervalued relative to other industries. The reason I get is, well, it's because investors are afraid you guys are going to do all the things you've done in the past to eliminate value. And as someone who's been around through all those years, I know what those things are and were, and the things that are rattled off, as you know, you're going to grow faster than – once you start making money, you'll grow faster than demand. Once you start making money, you'll give more to labor than you did when you were making less money, and they'll take some of the upside that should go to shareholders. Fuel prices will go up, and you guys won't be able to react. I would just point out this: In the last three years, all those things have happened. And that is unit revenues of – capacity has grown in excess of demand in the last couple years; and as a result, unit revenues have fallen at rates that we haven't seen in this business since 9/11. Probably more than they've ever fallen over a two-year period at any point in time. So unit revenues have declined because we've added more capacity than there is demand. Employee pay has increased at a rate that no one – that has never been seen before. And so that's happened. Fuel prices, indeed, have increased from where they were a year ago at 20%, 30%. So all that stuff has happened, and yet here we are – and indeed, that has an impact on earnings and the earnings are lower. But while they are – they're lower, they're at the lower end of the range I talked about – actually, not lower end of the range – just lower than target. So I feel really good about that target over time. All those things have happened. All the things people are worried that we would go do indeed have happened. I don't think those are any surprises, by the way. I don't think that's bad management. I think all those things are the right things to do. The reason capacity has grown in excess of supply is because we do have a different business. And when fuel prices fell as much as they did, the economics changed dramatically and more capacity rightfully came in because it was profitable capacity. The wages and benefits of employees in the airline business were a big part of how this – how the industry has survived and those had to be adjusted as the industry got past survival. So look, all of that stuff's happened. All the things that I think people were worried about we've done and we still have a business that is producing returns like it's never seen before. And also, I believe all of those things have gotten to a point where you – where we start to move into an area where you see kind of a more mature industry behave like a mature industry. But look, we will see over time, but I can't stress enough how bullish we are on the future. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Yeah, thanks for that. And I guess maybe I didn't ask my question – and maybe I'd have to wait for the Investor Day, but I guess I kind of want... William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Also, you – I rattled off on my tirade and I didn't – and we didn't answer your question. So Robert, what are initiatives for Dan? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, I just – yeah, the fortunate thing, again, as I said before is I think we've got some catch-up items and a number of things that we can improve on. So the list of items is long and it is something that is part of a plan that we are working through. So as I take a look, right, we have both fleet and network simplification and optimization activities that are going on right now. Some of them have been held up by integration, but the good news is, is that we have more in the hopper coming on both network and fleet. I mentioned to you about Basic Economy. We think that, that has legs throughout our system and it's just in its infancy. We think that Premium Economy will have tremendous benefits for our international network. I mentioned to you about wide-body interior improvements, notably the 777s in terms of finally getting lie-flat and density that's appropriate. I think that as I said, we have narrow-body density opportunities as well to pursue. Don has talked a lot about the RM improvements that have been made and will continue to be made and are being felt in the results that we have today. We are just now getting started on our re-launch of our sales activity and bringing on a full force of sales reps that, quite frankly, has been lacking over the last three years as we focused on other things. We are re-designing our AAdvantage program that we think will bring a considerable benefit as well. And as we've talked in the past, we think that there is a lot of benefit coming with our cobrand card as well. The list is long. And, again, we're just getting started. And a lot of this, fortunately, benefit is going to come to American. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Okay. Thanks. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Dan. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. All right. Thanks, guys. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, go ahead. You got another question? Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Well, I was just going to say, taking what you rattled off, over the course of the cycle, these initiatives are worth what in terms – X billion dollars, $2 billion, $2.5 billion? If you can just help size it for us or, again, maybe we have to wait for the Investor Day. I'm not sure. Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Wait for the Investor Day. We haven't – outside of Basic and Premium Economy, we haven't sized it and we'll be happy to shed more light on it later this year. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Okay. Thanks, guys. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Dan. Operator And we'll now go to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc. Yes. Good morning, guys. Thanks for getting me in at the end of the call here. Sorry, there's a few overlapping today. But, Doug, I missed your opening remarks here but you've been a huge proponent that this industry has changed. We just heard you respond to Dan's question about how the industry did add capacity. We are paying up labor. Earnings and margins have come down for two years now. So if you want to be getting a better evaluation like a more stable consistent industrial company, don't we need to reduce earnings volatility? And part of that process is, obviously, managing cost inflation with price inflation or the opportunities in your market. So I don't want to come across as being un-respectful to your front line employees, which definitely work hard and deserve increases but as a manager of this business, how do we talk to a shareholder that says we need to take the costs up-front, margins need to come down now but trust us. What's the inflection point that drives that better in the future? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Thanks, Brandon. Thanks for asking. And, again, with – I did try to address this earlier in the stuff you may have missed but I'll try again. The – I do think volatility of earnings are dramatically different than they used to be, and more importantly, the level of earnings at which we – the mean level from which you vacillate is much, much higher, and I don't – and that is different this time, and it's an enormous difference and I don't think that's been appreciated. So, but as to your volatility point, again, this is what we're doing today in terms of taking a group of our team members who was going to be, for two and a half years, paid a good bit less than their peers at other airlines, who were doing the same functions, is entirely consistent with my view that earnings are less volatile. This is getting to a level of compensation across the industry that needed to occur. And once you get to that level, I think you'll see, as you do in other mature businesses, that labor costs, certainly one, you get efficiencies over time, as good businesses do. But, two, labor costs per employee increases at rates commensurate with inflation. And I think it's what you'll see in this business. But all of us had to get to a point where we got to what, really, team members in this business deserve and none of them were there because of everything we had to do to survive. So that's what I think is happening here. It doesn't affect by any means our view about the long-term value; indeed as I said at the outset, it increases our confidence in our ability to go create that value because we can't do that without an excited and engaged team. We're making huge progress in that regard. We've got some momentum with this that has us very excited and we were concerned about our ability to maintain that momentum for the next two and a half years, while asking our team to live by a contract that they just happened to sign earlier than the rest of our team, and as a result found themselves further behind their peers than the rest of our team. So that didn't seem right to us, and that's – so when we see things that don't feel right, we correct them, we don't live by contracts we have in place, and that's what we did. And we feel extremely good about that, and it makes us feel even better about the long-term prospects. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc. I appreciate that response, Doug, and Wall Street can be fickle. So hopefully this works out. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Okay. It'll work for the long term. Thanks. Operator We'll pause for just a moment. We'll go first to Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Good morning, Andrea. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram Good morning, Doug. This question might be more for Robert. I was wondering if you could talk on the Basic Economy side. You mentioned how from a revenue standpoint, how customers are – or 50% of them are choosing main cabin over (79:41) and they're offered both. But I was wondering if you could talk more on the operations side of, how is it going for your gate agents, your flight attendants to implement this new fare that has restrictions on it for customers on the planes this past March? How has that gone so far on those 10 routes? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, thanks, Andrea. I think – look, we're benefiting from the tremendous amount of work that went in to planning. So we spent months and months prior to launch, prior to announcement, and did extensive training. And fortunately, I think our metered approach is working. And what we're seeing is that by and large, our customers understand the restrictions that are on the Basic Economy fare, and are complying with what our practice is at the gate. And so we're not seeing a lot of difficulty and really no issues to talk about. And I think that that's really evidenced by the kind of results that we're producing from an operational perspective, there hasn't been any impact to reliability, there hasn't been any impact on on-time departures. And I think what you'd hear from our in-flight crew is that they appreciate the benefit that comes with having fewer bags that are being brought on to the aircraft. So overall, I'm really pleased, but we're going to continue to take a measured approach and make sure that we're not surprised. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram Are you concerned at all about the summer travel season when these fares are introduced, when you have fliers that maybe typically don't fly as often? Maybe this is their once-a-year sort of trip and aren't as familiar with the changes. Are you a little concerned about how that might work at the gate? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, we'll be ready for it, and I think that's the key, is making sure that we let people – making sure that people are clear on what they're purchasing and certainly making sure that our team is ready to help and assist in any way possible. And at the end of the day, again, given the loads expected and strong demand, we anticipate that this will actually make things a little bit easier on the aircraft because of fewer carry-on bags. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram All right. Thank you. Operator We'll go next to Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News Good morning. Hey, this might be for Derek, I'm not sure. I wanted to ask, is there a place in your fleet for the A350? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. No, I think there is. I mean it's – but we're going to – we had a lot of wide-bodies come in. We had 787s and we had A350s coming on top of each other, so we needed to manage our delivery schedule and where our wide-bodies are. So at this point in time, yes. So we just pushed them off two years to make sure that we had a – didn't have too many wide-bodies coming to us at one point in time. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News Are you considering at all maybe converting those to another Airbus model? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Not at this time, no. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News Okay. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Mary. Operator Moving next to Ted Reed with TheStreet. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. Thank you. I have two questions about consumer perception. The first is consumer perception of the airline industry seems kind of low, and I just wonder if you made – if that was a consideration in these pay increases. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, look, we've been working on this for six-seven months so if you're talking about recent incidents, absolutely not. If you're – if you're asking do we think paying our team in line with our peers helps us do a better job of taking care of customers, absolutely, I absolutely believe that. But, yes, if you're asking if this is related to some high profile consumer events of recent times. Absolutely not, we've been working on this for several months. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. All right. Thank you. Second thing; in the case of the stroller incident, it seems from the video that a passenger assaulted a flight attendant. Are there any plans to have criminal charges against that passenger? Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc. You lost us on that. But no. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. Any reaction to the – to the video and the way the passengers – the way that the male passenger acted? Elise R. Eberwein - American Airlines Group, Inc. Which video are you talking about? Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. The stroller video with the passenger in first class seeming to assault and approach the flight attendant sort of maliciously. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, Ted, we don't have any comment on that. We're – the – we've commented on the incident itself. It was – and did everything we could to make sure we apologized to the customers involved. We have an amazing team of people in American Airlines which is why we like to do the things that we do today. And they are out there doing incredible things every day. We sometimes, because of our policies and procedures, put them in difficult situations, we are going to work to make sure we minimize those, but we are really happy with the job they do. And we are focused – and very proud of the job they do. And obviously our customers – we look to provide great service to our customers in the same way by giving our team the tools they need for their jobs because all they really want to do is take care of our customers. So anyway, that's where we are on that, and nothing new to report. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. All right. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks Ted. Operator Moving on to Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc. Good morning, guys. Excuse me. My question was just on Basic Economy again. Do you guys see the commercial value of that coming more from new passengers you'd attract who might otherwise fly just (85:56) other low cost carrier? Or is it more of what it enables you to do with your standard economy fares and what you're able to charge for those with this new bucket on the low end? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. This is Don Casey. The value comes – we know that there are many customers that are willing to spend a little bit more to fly on American because of the great product that we have. And under the current distribution models in the industry, it's very difficult to display anything other than the lowest fare. So by having two different products and different product attributes, this allows customers to actually make a choice which product is right for them. And we believe there are many occasions where customers are willing to pay just a little bit more to fly on American and the great product that we have. And if all they're really interested in is just having the lowest fair, that's the only thing that's really important to them, then we have a good product for them as well. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc. Thank you. Operator We'll go next to Dawn Gilbertson with The Arizona Republic. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. Good morning. Robert, you mentioned, or you and Don mentioned expansion of Basic Economy in May and June. Can you talk about those routes or markets? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. We're not – we're not naming any of those right now. But, again, Dawn, this is – this is something that eventually will be out to the entire network. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. You're not – you won't name them and May starts next week? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. That's when they're going to get loaded, so you'll see them soon. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. Okay. Why so secretive? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. There's no secrets behind it. This is the way, that we're launching and you'll see more about it as time comes. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Operator And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to your speakers for any closing remarks. Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thank you all very much for your interest. We appreciate it. And we – if you have any additional questions, investors, call Dan Cravens. Media, call our corporate communications. Thank you very much. We're done now. Operator That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

[Operation Instructions] And we will take our first question from Kevin Crissey with Citi. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hello, Kevin. Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Can you provide evidence that cultural investments are more than recouped through higher revenue? Having worked at JetBlue, I can assure you that investors are unconvinced by this argument. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yeah. Kevin, what I'm certain of is that we – the leverage in this airline is in closing the revenue gap that we have. And I'm equally certain that our ability to do that, while asking our team to work for less than their peers is a big challenge and one that I'm certain either is fair to our team nor to our leadership because it makes it increasingly difficult. So I don't know that I can directly answer your question but I'm highly confident that it is correlated. And would note, again, this isn't about us making a bet that, oh, if we can go get to rates that are – pay levels that are higher than others, that will get us something that will allow us to generate higher revenues than others. I don't think I would make that argument. This is about us getting our team to the levels that are currently in place at our competitor airlines and consistent with the commitment we made to our team at the time of the merger that we would compensate them in line with their peers at other airlines, a commitment again that we've made consistently with each and every contract. But in the case of these two contracts that were done shortly after the merger and were put in place on five-year terms, which is also worth noting, longer terms than the other airlines are putting in place today. It just got to where the gap was too big and it was going to be in place for too long and that didn't feel right to any of us. So I feel good about that commitment. It's a commitment we're happy to make, not just in this case, but to any of the rest of our team to the extent we see large discrepancies in our pay rates, our base pay rates versus competitors, other airlines and there's still significant amount of time and we can get that addressed through contract negotiations. You should expect us to correct it because that's the right thing to do for our team and I think – and I do believe, Kevin, what happens so long as we do that, we have an engaged and excited team that is seeing the trust they placed in us validated and they go take care of our customers and that's the best way to take care of our shareholder. Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. But isn't this taking your number one cost item and handing it over to the most aggressive competitor effectively? Whoever thinks that they can pay the most goes out and signs a contract and your labor rates are going to go to that optimistic or arguably the dumbest management team out there is an argument investors could look at. You've taken it out of your hands and put it in the hands of others and that doesn't feel like what well run companies do. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, I would beg to differ. Again, given the experience levels here, and what our teams have been through. And look, we're comfortable with the commitment. You're right, in one sense, I suppose, that if you want to look at our commitment and figure out what it means for the industry, the answer is you've got to go ask others in the industry because we're, indeed, not leading this charge. We're just making sure we're staying – we're catching up. So where it goes in the future will be dependent on what others do in the future. But look, I feel, I think again, I think this is – what you're seeing here is the maturing of an industry and an industry that has seen the people work in this business go through incredibly difficult times and what we needed to have happen was that get corrected. And I think look – and I think it's largely corrected. We were encouraged to hear Delta, apparently at their Investor Day, mentioned that they put in place a 6% pay increase for all their team, for all their non-union members, which at Delta is everyone, I believe, except their pilots and their dispatchers. So the vast majority of the airline they increased 6% again this year but note on their Investor Day they thought that was their last industry reset and they would see inflationary increases in the future. So I don't know that I agree with your premise but I certainly agree with our commitment and that is we're going to make sure, because it's important that our team who is an incredibly important part of our product is excited and engaged. And it's hard to do that if they see others that do the same job they do and don't do it as well at other companies, getting compensated more on an hourly basis. So that's important to us. It will continue to be important. I don't think it's dramatically different than if you saw another airline make some major enhancement to their in-flight product, you would see us match those because it is an important part of making sure that we're taking care of our customers. And these are the people to take care of our customers, the people that are on the frontline, not just our pilots and flight attendants, our mechanics, our fleet service employees, our reservations agents, our gate agents, every single one of them deserves the same commitment and we're happy to make it. Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Kevin. Operator Moving next to Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning, everybody. Doug, you have this plan to achieve pre-tax profits mid-cycle of $5 billion. Over the last year or so, it feels like you may have been retreating from that somewhat. Consensus estimates certainly don't embrace that outcome and now, of course, you're adding additional costs to your internal forecast. When do you think you'll be able to reverse direction and start moving towards that objective? Or are we doing the right thing by kind of just ignoring it? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yeah, Jamie, I think you referenced some comments that we made at your conference and the rest of the group may not know what you're talking about, so let me try. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC Oh, I'm sorry. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. That's quite all right. And I don't know, your conference is so well attended maybe everybody knows exactly what you're talking about but I'll try anyway. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC When it doesn't snow. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, that did make it rough. So look, and importantly, I need to restate it because – I would restate it slightly differently than what you just said. Here's what I said and here's what we do. And it's a really important point so I'm glad you raised it. We believe the – we have a company today that over – on average, over time in today's current environment, should generate pre-tax earnings of around $5 billion. Now, look, it's a volatile business. We all know that. That hasn't changed. While that level of earnings is a number that no one has ever fathomed before, the fact is it's still volatile. So, we think it will average $5 billion over time. We think the better years will look around like $7 billion and the lesser years will look around like $3 billion but over time, we should expect this company can generate over time $5 billion. Now, look, that is not just a statement that we make. That is how we compensate our every one of the employees at American Airlines that get an annual bonus, so everyone essentially manager level and above. That's why this is important. We use that formula I just said to fund our annual incentive pool, and we've done that since the merger. Now again, the $3 billion and $7 billion have moved around a little bit as we've gotten more comfortable with post-merger earnings, but the $5 billion hasn't changed since the day of the merger. And maybe it will change one day but we're not changing it – we're certainly – nothing about what we're seeing today leads us to believe that should change. So that's what I reported to you all is that – that's what we think about the earnings prospects of this company. And not only do we think that, that's how we fund our incentive pool. So, again, the way the incentive pool works, not that you care that much about our executive compensation, but I think it's really important to what you think about our expectations for the business. We fund the incentive pool by telling the team, look, if we have a year where we make $5 billion, we're going to fund the incentive pool at target. If we have a year where we make $3 billion, we're going to fund it at half of target, below that, there's no bonus. And if we have a year where we make $7 billion that's the maximum, which is double the bonus. So – and you're right, no one on the Street, I think, is forecasting $5 billion for American this year. But we didn't change that formula for the team. So this – if indeed the Street is right, this will be one of those years that's slightly worse. And there will be years in the future that are slightly better. What's important about this point is that if we are right, and, again, we're not just throwing out numbers here. This is how we're incentivizing our management team. If we're right, our stock is so undervalued it defies logic in my view. If we're right, and this company is going to – over time going to average $5 billion pre-tax, really easy – really simple math and you guys are a lot better at this than me, but I'll go to the simple math, $5 billion taxed is $3 billion, $3 billion and for a company today that is trading at somewhere around – has a market cap of about $24 billion, that's eight times what I'm telling you I think is our steady state earnings. Eight times steady state earnings when the average S&P company over the last 20-something years has had a multiple of earnings of something like, help me, Dan, 19 times. Feels like people don't believe the $5 million (sic) [$5 billion] (34:05) number. And that's fine. But we do. So that's why we're so bullish on the company. And the investments we've made today only strengthen that view. We don't look at that and think, oh, gosh, now it's $300 million harder to get to $5 billion. We look at this and say this reinforces our view that we're going to continue the momentum we have in improving the revenues by these investments we're making, and we feel even better about that in the long-term. So that's what I said, and that's what we still believe. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC As part of that, it looks like it still takes considerably more American employees to get the job done than at Delta. And it's tough for me to accurately do that analysis. There's some outsourcing issues we have to account for, but there do seem to be opportunities for American to become more efficient, and your letter last night seems to imply as much but maybe that's just my interpretation. Can you quantify the opportunity to improve labor efficiency? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, look, I would say this. When you say it's difficult for you to do that, I would argue it's almost impossible for you to compare those numbers. There are enormous differences in the amount of work that American does in-house versus what some other airlines do outside. So you wouldn't see it in the head count or in the salaries, you'd see it, instead, in their numbers and their outside services, and we try to do similar analysis and you can't get there, I don't think. But I'll tell you this, as is the case in most mergers, when you're running two airlines, you need to have some redundancies in place that as you get through the merger, you can eliminate, and we still have some of that in place. But rather than trying to quantify it, because I don't know that we know what it is yet and/or how we're going to manage it and over what period of time, I would just point you to the guidance that Derek rattled off on our cost trends. We had CASM ex fuel in the first quarter here of 8%. The second quarter we say 6% to 8%. The third quarter we say 3% to 5%. Fourth quarter we say 2% to 4%. That includes – again, those estimates include this adjustment that we made last night. So that's a rapidly declining year-over-year increase in cost. And while we're in no position to start giving 2018 guidance yet, I would certainly expect that that trend would continue into 2018 and that is that number of 2% to 4%. And fourth quarter 2017 would be even lower for the full year of 2018. So it's coming down. The rate of growth is certainly slowing. But look, we recognize that our job is to make sure we're running the airline efficiently, and we believe we're doing so today. There are some things that because we're still running in some cases two separate airlines that may have us doing that less efficiently than we'll be able to do over time, but we'll make sure we get there as quickly as we possibly can. I think you'll start to see most of that in 2018 and, again, nothing to report now on how big that will be because I don't think we know. I know we don't know because I don't know. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Yeah. Doug, I appreciate you taking my questions this morning. Thanks. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Jamie. Operator We'll go next to Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good morning, everyone. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Andrew. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Doug, on that note, in terms of the $5 billion, kind of, run rate pre-tax earnings, I guess, when you consider that, and given the permanent step-up in labor, does it change your view at all of capital allocation? With these higher fixed costs, would you consider more debt pay-down over share repurchases going forward? And if not, why? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. The short answer is no. And again, I come back to the overriding point, which is this increase in our near-term expenses in no way changes our view about our long-term prospects. Indeed, it gives us more confidence that they're achievable. So nothing about this makes us think anything about – and, again, let me make one other point on that because this seems to be a theme – a recurring theme that I'm having trouble getting across. We look at this longer term than – and on the long-term, this was an expense that was coming. There's no way when we got to 2020 and did new contracts, of course, that we're going to go sign new contracts with our team that were going to keep in place this sort of a gap. So we accelerated an expense. Again, not something we do lightly and not something we had to do, something we thought we should do. But none of this, to us, feels like any sort of change in the long-term prospects, and when we think about things like share repurchase and capital allocation, we think about it in the long-term. So no, no change in that. We're really confident with our current capital allocation. We think we're doing the right thing for our shareholders, we're happy yet again, as Derek noted, to make some purchases in the quarter that were a good bit less than the price at least as we opened today, and so we feel good about that. We think we – another thing worth noting again on the capital allocation piece is, yeah, our debt is higher, but it's because our assets are better. Another point that I think sometimes gets lost, maybe our fault for not mentioning it enough, but this higher levels in debt versus our competitors is driven by the fact that we have a much younger fleet, and that fleet is a lot more valuable. There's a fleet they have in place and that drives higher debt, of course. So we feel good about the capital allocation, and we will continue to do what's best for our shareholders and our team as we go forward. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it. Understood. I guess, maybe kind of changing gears a little bit, maybe one for Robert. Can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing on the Trans-Atlantic, given kind of this onslaught of low cost carrier capacity into the summer? Have you adapted the way you manage inventory in response to this at all? And kind of what are your expectations for demand on Trans-Atlantic as we head through the summer? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. I'll let Don give some more color. But we're optimistic about what we're seeing close in. But as you note, have concerns about capacity in the long run. Don? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Yes. I mean, we – clearly, there's a lot of capacity growth, and there's a pretty active pricing environment. The industry did a big reset in terms of pricing last year heading into the fourth quarter where we've been more – a bit more aggressive versus low cost carriers. We do have easing comps. So as we go forward, I think we're going to see the comps get a bit easier. We also ran last year at relatively low load factors, U.S. point of sale demand was not as strong as we had hoped last year. Although we're seeing some weakness coming out of the UK, overall, the U.S. point of sale seems very robust this year, and we expect, as we go through the summer that we're going to run materially higher load factors than last year. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thank you, everyone. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks. Operator We'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Hunter. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC Yes. Good morning. So I know, maybe it's a question for Derek, since Derek is the one that made this comment last quarter. I know you said, obviously, it's early to guide to 2018 CASM, but just last quarter you said you think you'd be able to keep CASM ex under 2% over the next couple of years. I'm not sure if you were referring to an average number, or each of the two years? But given the new labor cost increase, do you still feel like that's doable? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, I still feel like that's doable for each of the two years, not just over the two years but for each of the two years. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC All right. Good. And then just to be totally clear, I think, Robert, you said you expect continuing positive improvements in RASM each quarter this year. You weren't saying the 3Q growth rate was going to get better than 2Q or just saying it's going to be above zero, right? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. Do you want to give us maybe an early quick read on how you're thinking about 3Q, anything we should know about in terms of like calendar weirdness, or capacity or anything you're lapping, just to kind of give us an early thought, how to think about that sort of second derivative growth rate? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, there's really – there was a lot of pricing action in the domestic market last year that kind of got sorted out in July that had an impact on some of the bookings through August in particular. October actually was a bit of a weak month for just about everybody last year. But other than that, I think it's nothing stands out as being dramatically impacting the last half of 2017. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Hunter. Operator We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Hey. Thanks. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hi. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Just on the combination of CapEx and pension funding, can you walk us through that this year, 2018 and 2019? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. So in this year, we'll have $4.4 billion in combination, so CapEx of $4.1 billion. Pensions, we did $279 million. In 2018, CapEx – aircraft CapEx is $1.6 billion, and pension right now we're forecasting $1.1 billion. But one thing I want to note on that, that's an assumption that the mortality tables do change. If the mortality tables do not change, that'll be reduced by about $400 million, so we have the most conservative number in there. So it's $1.6 billion in aircraft CapEx and $1.1 billion in pension payments. And then in 2019, aircraft CapEx is $2.8 billion and pension payment is right at a $1 billion. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI And is that $1 billion level – for a longer-term model, is that $1 billion level kind of what we should be thinking about? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, it drops in – in 2020 it drops to $600 million; and 2021, it drops to $600 million. And those are all assuming the mortality table changes. If those don't change, then those could be modified, but it goes down to $600 million in 2020 and 2021, so I'd say the run rate is more $600 million past to the 2019 timeframe. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Okay. And we should add $1.5 billion in non-aircraft to those numbers? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Okay. Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. At least through 2020 and then I think it'll come down to about $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2021. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Thanks for that detail. Have you looked at – I know at least one competitor was able to go into the unsecured market and get very attractive rates to sort of advance fund some of that. Have you analyzed that? Is that something you could even do, given the higher leverage? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. We have analyzed it. We could do it if we want. We think we're – we don't have any requirement to do any payment until 2018 and don't believe we should go forward with that. I think the $1.1 billion we're doing in 2018 will get us to 80% funded which is exactly where one of my competitors went to. So that's the reason we're going to 2018. We only have to do, I think it's $60 million in 2018, so the $1.1 billion is significantly over what we're required to do in order for us to get to that 80% funded once the Airline Relief Act comes off. So, well, it's similar to what they're doing, we just don't need to do it until 2018. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Thanks very much. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Duane. Operator We'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hello. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Good morning. Thanks for the time. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Good morning. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Robert and Don, this'll probably be for you. You – your updated RASM guide points to sequential improvement that's relatively modest versus peers and relative to just what you posted in 1Q, and you've highlighted a lot of revenue opportunities that are impressive out there. What do you think is the driver there in terms of the lack of an acceleration, given all the things that you've got going on? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. I'm not so sure I'd characterize it like that because in all honesty, what we're seeing is a lot of demand for our Premium cabin, and that I think is a sign that the kind of investments that we're making are taking root. We see that strength holding strong forward in the business market and from a business perspective as well. And I think that our outperformance is going to continue. It – we've got a good impressive string here, and that's what we see going forward. Don? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Yes... William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Go ahead, Don. I'm sorry. Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Yeah. I mean, I – first of all, let's not, I guess, confuse guidance with performance. Guidance is guidance and not everybody hits their guidance. So we'll see how the actuals come in when we get through the second quarter. Although on the – from a guidance perspective, this looks like a – sequentially we're not increasing as much. But this will again be the fourth quarter in a row where our performance is better than everybody else's, and so we'll just have to wait and see where the actuals come in, in terms of year-over-year versus others. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yeah. Thanks, Don. That's what I was going to say. And again, the others may meet their guidance and we may exceed our guidance. If you're asking us to forecast the gap versus the others, we're certainly not forecasting that that gap will narrow in the second quarter. We just think we probably have – we may have different biases in our forecasting. Ours might be more conservative than theirs. But if the second quarter actuals come in and that gap closes, that's, I don't know, we'll look at why that happened if that happens, but we certainly don't expect that. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Point taken. And the other question, a bit more nuanced, can you talk about the outlook for the LatAm market? Robert, I think you provided some color for 2Q but I was looking for more, just beyond, as far as puts and takes in regard to supply demand, what South America is looking like, Mexico, Caribbean, et cetera. Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Okay. This is Don. We had, obviously, a very solid first quarter performance in Latin America, Brazil led the way. We had positive unit revenue in all of South America and low single digit declines in the rest of the South America market. As we look forward into the second quarter, we see continuing strength, actually strength improving. And in the second quarter, we expect a positive year-over-year unit revenue in every entity in Latin America that it looks very, very robust at this point. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC And just broader puts and takes as we look beyond 2Q as far as what you're seeing or thinking on the supply side? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. We're not really seeing anything dramatic on the supply side in LatAm, overall. We're seeing affirmative growth in Mexico but we're seeing a lot of demand growth as well, but nothing that we see that's going to change our current outlook. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Very helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator We'll go next to Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Hey, Doug, you've alluded a couple of times to this opportunity to go drive some relative revenue improvement relative to your peers over the next few years. I mean, I guess, I was just hoping that you'd help characterize where do you think the relative revenue discount is coming from today? I mean, is it network or is it on-time performance? And can you help us understand, sort of, what are the components of that you think are addressable versus those that perhaps aren't as addressable? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. I'll let Robert try and do that probably more in terms of the things we think we can do to close as opposed to what drivers are. Go ahead, Robert. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Darryl, I'd just like to point out that I think there are a number of things that are benefiting us that are certainly due to the investments we've been making, but in all honesty a lot of catch-up and I do think is – will benefit us and it's going to be unique to American. Some of the things that are just taking root now, as we've talked about, we are still confident that between our Basic and Premium Economy products that we're talking about a $1 billion worth of incremental revenue, which is sizable. I think everybody – I think you know that we haven't really had a premium product for our widebody long haul flying that's been consistent out in the marketplace. And so, this year we will finally have a lie-flat product across all international entities, which is fantastic. We think that we have some density issues with our narrow body fleet that we will be addressing in the coming years as well that I think will have benefits in terms of overall revenue production and also will help us from a unit cost perspective as well. Don and team have been making improvements in revenue management. And I want to underscore the work that we're doing with our sales team as well. And I'd like to say that a lot of that's baked into the current numbers, but I'm glad that as we look forward that that is just coming on, and we think is going to continue to drive outperformance versus the industry. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC Okay. So you think all that stuff, and I realize that it is difficult to see this, but if you were to take all of that stuff you that just mentioned there, which seem relatively addressable in nature and add them all up that that's enough to offset both the discount, for instance, from Delta that you're achieving today as well as what I'd call probably a positive or relatively positive impact from you already having to do a fleet in the industry. Is that a fair characterization or is there something structural about the network that's also causing you some difficulty? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. When we take a look at the list of initiatives that we are pursuing, we think that that will definitely make us competitive. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thanks very much, guys. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Darryl. Operator And please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. We'll go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Thank you very much. So, Doug, back in 2007 when you were running Airways, you said at the time you were talking to some bankers to get a sense of what the loyalty program could be worth. We've spoken to a couple of guys in private equity and they would use about a 15 times EBITDA multiple on it. That puts the valuation somewhere around $30 billion to $40 billion. Your market cap is half that. So two questions, would that surprise you, that valuation, and if it made sense to see what it was worth back then, why doesn't it make sense to do the same thing now? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, first off, I can't believe I said that in 2007, but if you say I did, okay. This has been an issue, at least from our perspective is it's part and parcel of the airline and part of running the airline and part of inventory management and something that at least in my recollection I've never considered as a particularly good idea to spend out – maybe when we forgot exactly how we financed survival it might have been something we were looking at. But so, anyway, rather than trying to figure out why I said something in 2007, I'll tell you what we think now, which is. Yes. Well, first up to your larger question, would it surprise me to learn that's the value of the advantage program? I would have to say, yes. Because that is greater than the value of American Airlines in total as we sit here today. But I am not arguing with you. You guys are better at doing valuations than we are, and the market will decide. I find it odd that simply separating something that is inside the airline today and putting it into a separate entity with the exact same cash flows would somehow generate that much incremental value, but again, that's something that you guys can figure out better than we can. But actually, I should be careful on that. If we believe that, then of course we would be spending perhaps more effort trying to figure out how to spend it out. What I believe is the advantage program is really valuable. It's an incredible part of our airline. It's a significant reason that we feel so good about our future. And we maximize the value for our shareholders. And whether or not that is done in-house or in a separate entity, that's going to be the case. And the value will be created. So we agree with you, there's a lot of value there. We agree with you that perhaps that's another reason the airline is undervalued, I just think we're undervalued for all sorts of reasons. I think people don't appreciate what's happened in this industry or this airline, and how it's going to make a difference in the long term. And that's where we're focused. As I told you last time, we agree with your pointing this out, and we will continue to try to do a better job of pointing out to investors as best we can the value of the advantage program. But it's part and parcel of the airline and a really important part of the airline and one that we're happy with the way it's being managed and the value it's producing. And it's in our – in the results of the airline today and in the future. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. I mean I guess, Doug, I would just say that the past two years at Jamie's conference, you've made your – making the lead presentation and talked about why there's less cyclicality in the business and the credit card and loyalty program isn't a part of that. So I'm just wondering, do you not mention it because you don't believe that it's an important part of improving cyclicality? Or are you just hesitant to talk about it because it seems like the first rule of having an airline cobrand card is you don't talk about the airline cobrand card? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Okay. Fair enough. It's not that. So, yes, okay, fair enough. We should probably spend a little more time pointing out that that stream of our earnings is a little less volatile than other streams. So noted. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Thanks, Doug. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks. Operator Moving on to Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC Thanks, operator. Hi, team. Thanks for taking the question. As I think about your domestic route network. I know you're focused on Los Angeles, and maybe you can give us a update on facilities and what you're doing there in terms of have the new facilities opening and so on. And then when I think about the growth that's occurring in Fort Lauderdale and the other side of the country, you guys have the big hub in Miami, I get it, in Latin America and so on. But do you worry about the huge increase in capacity an hour and a half north of one of your major, most important hubs and just wondering if you can comment on kind of those two issues? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Steve Johnson will take the LA piece. Stephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc. Sure. Thanks, Helane. Just with respect to facilities in Los Angeles, we – I think everybody knows that earlier this year or late last year, we actually opened the connector between the Bradley Terminal and Terminal 4, which is in use. I got to use it personally just the other day. It's a great way to get from international connection to our domestic service or vice versa. And that's been a big hit with our customers. Then, very recently, we moved our limited operation that was in Terminal 6 to Terminal 5 and to adjacent to the tunnel that goes between Terminal 4 and Terminal 5. So those gates are now much more adjacent and much more convenient for our customers to use. And then finally, we're in negotiations with LAWA for a long-term lease at LAX that will change the face of our facilities there. Those negotiations are confidential beyond that, so I won't say anymore, but we're hopeful that we can get those completed in the next four or five weeks. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. And, Helane, I'll talk a little bit more about South Florida. So, we understand the competition and then also the nature of the markets, and so there's always appropriate consideration. But look, Fort Lauderdale, it's a nice, local market operation. We view Miami differently. We do view it as the ideal connecting opportunity and hub for American, but not just American, of any carrier to the South America. We've got a nice position there. And a lot of the work that we're doing is really to try to maximize the flows and over the long run, we do think that that is something that is going to set us apart. And you may have noticed recently that's actually helped us in markets like Cuba, where we can do things because of the connecting power of the hub, and we're going to continue to make sure that we maximize utility of that operation. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Great. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Helane. Operator Moving next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Michael. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hey. Thanks, guys. Just two quick ones here. Bob, you talked about positive improvement in corporate share when you were talking about domestic PRASM. Any particular sectors or regions where you saw some share gains that you can elaborate on? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. It's Don. I mean, to be honest with you... Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, Don. Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. We saw improvement across the board for our – in corporate markets. And this, again, marks a kind of high-water mark for us since the merger. And in the first quarter, we had our best performance in terms of both share and share gap, and our trends heading into second quarter are also very strong. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay, great. And then just second, just a clarification on the CapEx deferral to Derek. Is that – so is that $800 million or $1.1 billion? I'm not sure if it's $300 million in two years or $300 million per year? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. $300 million per year. So it's $1.1 billion over the three years. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Perfect. Thanks. Operator Savi Syth with Raymond James has our next question. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey. Good morning. A question on the – in the last few years, I think American has been a little bit more exposed to some areas that have seen greater pressure, be it South America, be it some of the aggressive pricing on low-cost carrier markets, and we are seeing that reverse. I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on how much more we could see, or how much more there is to go? And maybe some that might not come back in the near-term? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Okay. I mean, basically clearly we had some kind of unique headwinds that affected us, right? The Southwest growth at Love Field, the OCC growth Brazil, Venezuela. But we really kind of came out from under all that at the end of the second quarter of last year. And so, Brazil's clearly one area where we're seeing some year-over-year improvement, but the rest of that really doesn't really drive any year-over-year change. So the real value we're seeing and the uptick in our revenue performance, although Brazil is a piece of that, it's really being driven by all of the other initiatives we have out there in the marketplace. It's the new airplanes, it's the new product, it's the restructuring of our Advantage program, it's the investment we're making in sales, and the investment and change we're making in revenue management. All the things we're doing, which is a long list, right, is really what's driving the benefit. It's not just some lucky, fortunate year-over-year comparison. It's really kind of fundamental, the fundamentals that are getting better for us. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Sorry. And I meant, not necessarily a comparison issue but maybe a reversal issue of some of the pressures that you saw. Finally a follow-up on Mike's question on corporate, was – are we seeing corporate revenue and yields up now year-over-year? Is that firmly in that trend? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Actually in the fourth quarter we did see yields come up. In the first quarter of this year, we saw yields actually for corporate flattish. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thanks very much. Operator Moving on to Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Just kind of going back to comments earlier around the revenue initiatives, specifically some initiatives around improving the density on the narrow body fleet. Can you just expand on that for a moment in terms of when you think that could begin to impact results and sort of the opportunity there? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. So those are things that we look at on an ongoing basis. And again, some of the things that you will see showing up is the work that we've done with our wide body, our 777 reconfiguration program where we're moving to a standard configuration. So that's on that front. And we think that there's opportunities with the narrow bodies as well. And that is something that you'll see in 2018 and beyond. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Okay. And then just kind of following up on that as well. Thinking about your prepared comments on Basic and Premium Economy, just sort of curious if you could update us in terms of how you're thinking about the portion of your domestic flights that will have those two additional classes of service on them by year-end. And then, just what sort of revenue impact that's expected to have in the back half of the year as comps perhaps get a little bit more challenging? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. So in terms of Basic, that's something that we anticipate for – it will be something that we offer throughout our network. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Yes. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. So for Basic, it's really just the timing of the rollout for us, right? So, we have more markets coming in May and June. These are still, I guess, I would view as kind of test markets, the next two tranches similar to the first tranche. But we're going to end up expanding this broadly across the whole network eventually, right, and pacing item for that is really going to be our training and staffing. But we're committed to roll this out everywhere, and we're quite encouraged by the initial results. Premium Economy is the next thing. And we don't really kind of get to a critical mass of airplanes on our roll-out of Premium Economy probably until we get in first quarter of next year. So we still kind of consider what we're doing right now kind of a test, and we're very focused on this. A lot of it is channel education. We're the first U.S. airline to have this product, and so we need to make sure that all of our distribution, all of our selling channels know what the product is. And we need to make sure we work with our third-party distributors as well to make sure that the product is being appropriately displayed in all the systems, so people will understand what it is and what they're buying. And that's what we're focused on right now for Premium Economy. But, again, it will be critical mass by the first quarter of next year. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Okay. Thanks again for the time. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks. Operator And Brandon Oglenski with Barclays has our next question. Sorry. Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research has our next question. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Dan. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys. Doug, help us understand why the $5 billion pre-tax target is realistic from your perspective. You're saying it's the right hurdle for executive compensation, and I know you. You're not pulling that out of thin air. Why is that? So from where you sit, what are the larger revenue opportunities over the cycle that gives you confidence you can offset the labor headwinds this morning, and what are the new initiatives worth over the coming one to two years? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. I think Robert laid those out pretty well. He can lay them out again for you, if you'd like, as to what the initiatives are. And as to the value themselves, we mentioned that as well. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Basic and Premium Economy we mentioned. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Right. So look, that is the value that gives us confidence. All you need to do is look at the current gap in revenue per ASM as soon as we close that, you easily get to numbers like $5 billion as a run rate number. So, look, but that's not how we go about coming up with this number. The way we come up with this number is knowing what we do about where the industry is today and where American Airlines is positioned in that industry, both of which we feel good about and both of which feel dramatically different than they've ever been before. And based upon that view, that's what this feel – that's what the company feels like to us. I don't want to portend or pretend that we go and that – those numbers I said to you are the basis of some enormous analysis that's laid out for the next 15 years. It's where we believe this company is today. And look, the facts support it. Since the time of the merger, we have had earnings in that range. This is a worse year than others, and it's still in the range. One of the things I do like to point out to people when they – part of the reason – part of the explanation, at least, I get sometimes, Dan, from investors as to why it is even if you believe what we – why it is that that we are so undervalued relative to other industries. The reason I get is, well, it's because investors are afraid you guys are going to do all the things you've done in the past to eliminate value. And as someone who's been around through all those years, I know what those things are and were, and the things that are rattled off, as you know, you're going to grow faster than – once you start making money, you'll grow faster than demand. Once you start making money, you'll give more to labor than you did when you were making less money, and they'll take some of the upside that should go to shareholders. Fuel prices will go up, and you guys won't be able to react. I would just point out this: In the last three years, all those things have happened. And that is unit revenues of – capacity has grown in excess of demand in the last couple years; and as a result, unit revenues have fallen at rates that we haven't seen in this business since 9/11. Probably more than they've ever fallen over a two-year period at any point in time. So unit revenues have declined because we've added more capacity than there is demand. Employee pay has increased at a rate that no one – that has never been seen before. And so that's happened. Fuel prices, indeed, have increased from where they were a year ago at 20%, 30%. So all that stuff has happened, and yet here we are – and indeed, that has an impact on earnings and the earnings are lower. But while they are – they're lower, they're at the lower end of the range I talked about – actually, not lower end of the range – just lower than target. So I feel really good about that target over time. All those things have happened. All the things people are worried that we would go do indeed have happened. I don't think those are any surprises, by the way. I don't think that's bad management. I think all those things are the right things to do. The reason capacity has grown in excess of supply is because we do have a different business. And when fuel prices fell as much as they did, the economics changed dramatically and more capacity rightfully came in because it was profitable capacity. The wages and benefits of employees in the airline business were a big part of how this – how the industry has survived and those had to be adjusted as the industry got past survival. So look, all of that stuff's happened. All the things that I think people were worried about we've done and we still have a business that is producing returns like it's never seen before. And also, I believe all of those things have gotten to a point where you – where we start to move into an area where you see kind of a more mature industry behave like a mature industry. But look, we will see over time, but I can't stress enough how bullish we are on the future. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Yeah, thanks for that. And I guess maybe I didn't ask my question – and maybe I'd have to wait for the Investor Day, but I guess I kind of want... William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Also, you – I rattled off on my tirade and I didn't – and we didn't answer your question. So Robert, what are initiatives for Dan? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, I just – yeah, the fortunate thing, again, as I said before is I think we've got some catch-up items and a number of things that we can improve on. So the list of items is long and it is something that is part of a plan that we are working through. So as I take a look, right, we have both fleet and network simplification and optimization activities that are going on right now. Some of them have been held up by integration, but the good news is, is that we have more in the hopper coming on both network and fleet. I mentioned to you about Basic Economy. We think that, that has legs throughout our system and it's just in its infancy. We think that Premium Economy will have tremendous benefits for our international network. I mentioned to you about wide-body interior improvements, notably the 777s in terms of finally getting lie-flat and density that's appropriate. I think that as I said, we have narrow-body density opportunities as well to pursue. Don has talked a lot about the RM improvements that have been made and will continue to be made and are being felt in the results that we have today. We are just now getting started on our re-launch of our sales activity and bringing on a full force of sales reps that, quite frankly, has been lacking over the last three years as we focused on other things. We are re-designing our AAdvantage program that we think will bring a considerable benefit as well. And as we've talked in the past, we think that there is a lot of benefit coming with our cobrand card as well. The list is long. And, again, we're just getting started. And a lot of this, fortunately, benefit is going to come to American. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Okay. Thanks. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Dan. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. All right. Thanks, guys. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, go ahead. You got another question? Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Well, I was just going to say, taking what you rattled off, over the course of the cycle, these initiatives are worth what in terms – X billion dollars, $2 billion, $2.5 billion? If you can just help size it for us or, again, maybe we have to wait for the Investor Day. I'm not sure. Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Wait for the Investor Day. We haven't – outside of Basic and Premium Economy, we haven't sized it and we'll be happy to shed more light on it later this year. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Okay. Thanks, guys. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Dan. Operator And we'll now go to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc. Yes. Good morning, guys. Thanks for getting me in at the end of the call here. Sorry, there's a few overlapping today. But, Doug, I missed your opening remarks here but you've been a huge proponent that this industry has changed. We just heard you respond to Dan's question about how the industry did add capacity. We are paying up labor. Earnings and margins have come down for two years now. So if you want to be getting a better evaluation like a more stable consistent industrial company, don't we need to reduce earnings volatility? And part of that process is, obviously, managing cost inflation with price inflation or the opportunities in your market. So I don't want to come across as being un-respectful to your front line employees, which definitely work hard and deserve increases but as a manager of this business, how do we talk to a shareholder that says we need to take the costs up-front, margins need to come down now but trust us. What's the inflection point that drives that better in the future? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Thanks, Brandon. Thanks for asking. And, again, with – I did try to address this earlier in the stuff you may have missed but I'll try again. The – I do think volatility of earnings are dramatically different than they used to be, and more importantly, the level of earnings at which we – the mean level from which you vacillate is much, much higher, and I don't – and that is different this time, and it's an enormous difference and I don't think that's been appreciated. So, but as to your volatility point, again, this is what we're doing today in terms of taking a group of our team members who was going to be, for two and a half years, paid a good bit less than their peers at other airlines, who were doing the same functions, is entirely consistent with my view that earnings are less volatile. This is getting to a level of compensation across the industry that needed to occur. And once you get to that level, I think you'll see, as you do in other mature businesses, that labor costs, certainly one, you get efficiencies over time, as good businesses do. But, two, labor costs per employee increases at rates commensurate with inflation. And I think it's what you'll see in this business. But all of us had to get to a point where we got to what, really, team members in this business deserve and none of them were there because of everything we had to do to survive. So that's what I think is happening here. It doesn't affect by any means our view about the long-term value; indeed as I said at the outset, it increases our confidence in our ability to go create that value because we can't do that without an excited and engaged team. We're making huge progress in that regard. We've got some momentum with this that has us very excited and we were concerned about our ability to maintain that momentum for the next two and a half years, while asking our team to live by a contract that they just happened to sign earlier than the rest of our team, and as a result found themselves further behind their peers than the rest of our team. So that didn't seem right to us, and that's – so when we see things that don't feel right, we correct them, we don't live by contracts we have in place, and that's what we did. And we feel extremely good about that, and it makes us feel even better about the long-term prospects. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc. I appreciate that response, Doug, and Wall Street can be fickle. So hopefully this works out. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Okay. It'll work for the long term. Thanks. Operator We'll pause for just a moment. We'll go first to Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Good morning, Andrea. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram Good morning, Doug. This question might be more for Robert. I was wondering if you could talk on the Basic Economy side. You mentioned how from a revenue standpoint, how customers are – or 50% of them are choosing main cabin over (79:41) and they're offered both. But I was wondering if you could talk more on the operations side of, how is it going for your gate agents, your flight attendants to implement this new fare that has restrictions on it for customers on the planes this past March? How has that gone so far on those 10 routes? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, thanks, Andrea. I think – look, we're benefiting from the tremendous amount of work that went in to planning. So we spent months and months prior to launch, prior to announcement, and did extensive training. And fortunately, I think our metered approach is working. And what we're seeing is that by and large, our customers understand the restrictions that are on the Basic Economy fare, and are complying with what our practice is at the gate. And so we're not seeing a lot of difficulty and really no issues to talk about. And I think that that's really evidenced by the kind of results that we're producing from an operational perspective, there hasn't been any impact to reliability, there hasn't been any impact on on-time departures. And I think what you'd hear from our in-flight crew is that they appreciate the benefit that comes with having fewer bags that are being brought on to the aircraft. So overall, I'm really pleased, but we're going to continue to take a measured approach and make sure that we're not surprised. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram Are you concerned at all about the summer travel season when these fares are introduced, when you have fliers that maybe typically don't fly as often? Maybe this is their once-a-year sort of trip and aren't as familiar with the changes. Are you a little concerned about how that might work at the gate? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, we'll be ready for it, and I think that's the key, is making sure that we let people – making sure that people are clear on what they're purchasing and certainly making sure that our team is ready to help and assist in any way possible. And at the end of the day, again, given the loads expected and strong demand, we anticipate that this will actually make things a little bit easier on the aircraft because of fewer carry-on bags. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram All right. Thank you. Operator We'll go next to Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News Good morning. Hey, this might be for Derek, I'm not sure. I wanted to ask, is there a place in your fleet for the A350? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. No, I think there is. I mean it's – but we're going to – we had a lot of wide-bodies come in. We had 787s and we had A350s coming on top of each other, so we needed to manage our delivery schedule and where our wide-bodies are. So at this point in time, yes. So we just pushed them off two years to make sure that we had a – didn't have too many wide-bodies coming to us at one point in time. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News Are you considering at all maybe converting those to another Airbus model? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Not at this time, no. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News Okay. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Mary. Operator Moving next to Ted Reed with TheStreet. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. Thank you. I have two questions about consumer perception. The first is consumer perception of the airline industry seems kind of low, and I just wonder if you made – if that was a consideration in these pay increases. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, look, we've been working on this for six-seven months so if you're talking about recent incidents, absolutely not. If you're – if you're asking do we think paying our team in line with our peers helps us do a better job of taking care of customers, absolutely, I absolutely believe that. But, yes, if you're asking if this is related to some high profile consumer events of recent times. Absolutely not, we've been working on this for several months. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. All right. Thank you. Second thing; in the case of the stroller incident, it seems from the video that a passenger assaulted a flight attendant. Are there any plans to have criminal charges against that passenger? Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc. You lost us on that. But no. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. Any reaction to the – to the video and the way the passengers – the way that the male passenger acted? Elise R. Eberwein - American Airlines Group, Inc. Which video are you talking about? Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. The stroller video with the passenger in first class seeming to assault and approach the flight attendant sort of maliciously. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, Ted, we don't have any comment on that. We're – the – we've commented on the incident itself. It was – and did everything we could to make sure we apologized to the customers involved. We have an amazing team of people in American Airlines which is why we like to do the things that we do today. And they are out there doing incredible things every day. We sometimes, because of our policies and procedures, put them in difficult situations, we are going to work to make sure we minimize those, but we are really happy with the job they do. And we are focused – and very proud of the job they do. And obviously our customers – we look to provide great service to our customers in the same way by giving our team the tools they need for their jobs because all they really want to do is take care of our customers. So anyway, that's where we are on that, and nothing new to report. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. All right. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks Ted. Operator Moving on to Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc. Good morning, guys. Excuse me. My question was just on Basic Economy again. Do you guys see the commercial value of that coming more from new passengers you'd attract who might otherwise fly just (85:56) other low cost carrier? Or is it more of what it enables you to do with your standard economy fares and what you're able to charge for those with this new bucket on the low end? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. This is Don Casey. The value comes – we know that there are many customers that are willing to spend a little bit more to fly on American because of the great product that we have. And under the current distribution models in the industry, it's very difficult to display anything other than the lowest fare. So by having two different products and different product attributes, this allows customers to actually make a choice which product is right for them. And we believe there are many occasions where customers are willing to pay just a little bit more to fly on American and the great product that we have. And if all they're really interested in is just having the lowest fair, that's the only thing that's really important to them, then we have a good product for them as well. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc. Thank you. Operator We'll go next to Dawn Gilbertson with The Arizona Republic. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. Good morning. Robert, you mentioned, or you and Don mentioned expansion of Basic Economy in May and June. Can you talk about those routes or markets? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. We're not – we're not naming any of those right now. But, again, Dawn, this is – this is something that eventually will be out to the entire network. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. You're not – you won't name them and May starts next week? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. That's when they're going to get loaded, so you'll see them soon. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. Okay. Why so secretive? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. There's no secrets behind it. This is the way, that we're launching and you'll see more about it as time comes. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Operator And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to your speakers for any closing remarks. Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thank you all very much for your interest. We appreciate it. And we – if you have any additional questions, investors, call Dan Cravens. Media, call our corporate communications. Thank you very much. We're done now. Operator That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements. I'll now turn it over to Charlie Alutto, CEO. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Thank you, Sean. Hello, everybody. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Overall, we're very pleased with our first quarter performance. Highlights for the quarter included a great start to the year from our Secure Information Destruction Services. Another strong quarter from our Communication and Related Service business, and our Regulated Waste and Compliance Services came in as expected. Joining me on today's call to discuss these highlights and other items from the quarter will be Dan Ginnetti, CFO; and Brent Arnold, COO. I will now turn it over to Dan. Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Charlie. The results for the first quarter are as follows. Global revenues were $892.4 million, up 2.1% from $874.2 million in Q1 2016. And internal growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures and manufacturing and industrial service, was 3.6%. Domestic and Canada revenues were $710.8 million. Internal growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, was 2.2%. International revenues were $181.6 million. Internal growth, when adjusted for foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures was 1.8%. As anticipated, internal growth rates were impacted by the exiting of certain patient transportation contracts and manufacturing and industrial services. Acquisitions contributed $10 million to growth in the quarter and divestitures reduced revenues by $0.7 million. Gross profit was $368.7 million, or 41.3% of revenues. Gross profit was reduced by approximately 40 basis points in the quarter due to a reclassification of certain expenses from SG&A to cost of revenues. This reclassification impacts historic and future reporting. SG&A, excluding amortization, was $198.3 million, or 22.2% of revenues. Adjusted income from operations, or EBITA, was $170.4 million, or 19.1% of revenues. Net interest expense was $23.3 million. The as-reported tax rate for the quarter was 34.7%. Net income, attributable to Stericycle was $53.4 million, or $0.62 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.09 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.38 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver was approximately $715 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 145,700 shares of the mandatory preferred convertible on the open market in the amount of $9.6 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 2.9 million shares. Our CapEx was $33.1 million, or 3.7% of revenues. Our DSO was 62 days. Year-to-date, as reported cash from operations was $175.3 million and when adjusted for recall reimbursements and other items, cash from operations was $197.7 million. I will now turn it over to Brent. Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Dan. This quarter, we closed 13 tuck-in acquisitions. The 13 acquisitions include nine in the US and Canada and four international. Revenues in the quarter were approximately $2 million and annualized are approximately $13.7 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. In the quarter, we saw strong sales and operational performance from our Secure Information Destruction team, another solid quarter from our Communication and Related Services team, and good progress on our SQ strategic investments. Our Secure Information Destruction revenue was strong for both ongoing and one-time services. This sales activity combined with higher recycling revenue generated organic growth of 8%. The success factors contributing to our sales performance include: the investments we made in our sales team, the impact of our cross-selling initiatives and the team's ability to convert the unvended market. We are pleased with the progress the team has made in the past year. The integration of our Shred-It and subsequent tuck-in acquisitions remain on track. The investments we made in call center automation, intelligent work distribution systems and standardized best practices across our branches are making us more efficient and improving our overall service. The Communication and Related Services team also delivered a very strong first quarter. Our market-leading position and unique capabilities have enabled us to serve new brands across many industries. For the first time as a combined business, we leveraged our call center agents and operational infrastructure to meet the needs of several large recall customers. Within the SQ business, we continue to invest in our data analytic capabilities and to pinpoint areas of opportunities and improve our performance. We remain excited about these new tools and how they will help us drive future growth and reduce the impact of pricing pressures. In closing, I would like to thank all of our worldwide team members for their continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders, and our core values. I will now turn it over to Charlie. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2017. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition related expenses, and other adjusted items. For 2017, we believe EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.55 to $4.75, using a share count of approximately 91 million. This includes the impact from foreign exchange and acquisitions. We believe revenues for 2017 will be in the range of $3.53 billion to $3.66 billion depending on assumptions of foreign exchange and internal growth rates. The worldwide revenue guidance for each of our service lines is: Regulated Waste and Compliance Services will be in a range of $2.01 billion to $2.06 billion. Secure Information Destruction Services will be in a range of $795 million to $825 million. Communication and Related Services will be in a range of $345 million to $375 million, depending on recall revenues. Manufacturing and Industrial Services will be in a range of $375 million to $395 million. This includes the full year impact of the UK divested M&I asset. We have estimates for adjusted free cash flow in 2017 of between $450 million to $470 million. 2017 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $150 million. We expect the 2017 full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. We are very pleased with the start of 2017 and we are confident in the long-term outlook for our business. Thank you for your time today. We'll now answer any questions. Please keep in mind that we have many analysts who follow Stericycle. We ask that you limit yourself to a couple of questions. Kelly, you can now open the Q&A line. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Certainly. Our first question comes from Sean Dodge from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe starting with the SQ pricing, you guys had built $40 million of pressure into 2017. What was the experience during the first quarter and maybe can you talk about how comfortable you still are with a $40 million target for the year? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, thanks, Sean. With respect to Q1, Q1 SQ pricing pressure came in generally as we expected. So there is no change to the assumptions for SQ pricing pressure that we discussed at our investment day this past November. Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC Okay. And then the M&I guidance, it looks like you took that up for the full year despite what kind of looked like a tough start to the year. Can you talk about what happened there and maybe your level of comfort that we'll see an acceleration as the quarters roll on? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes. Actually, Sean, the M&I revenue guidance for the full year is unchanged. It's still $375 million to $395 million. As far as the M&I growth rates in Q1, it generally came in as expected. The results were negatively impacted by an unfavorable Q1 2016 comp, FX, UK divestiture, but with respect to our guidance, it's unchanged. So we think it will come in line for the remainder of the year. Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC Got it. Thanks, again. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Sean. Operator Your next question comes from Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC Yes, thanks for the time, gents. I wanted to start with a question on some the investments you're making in core regulated medical waste on the sales and marketing front. It sounded like in your prepared comments you're already seeing some benefits there. So you can you maybe go through a little bit what you're seeing and what specific areas have driven the most return on investment for the organization? Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. Hey, Ryan, this is Brent. I'll take that one. Let's start with the data analytics piece because that's where we've made a lot of good progress. So far the team has put the tools in place. We've hired some key folks with the technical expertise to help us kind of pull all this together. We are currently using big data and predictive analytics to guide our efforts in a number of areas. I would say one is our lead loads for our sales teams. Another is creating more effective sales offers for our customers. Both of those initiatives, we are seeing improve sales effectiveness for our team. So those are early payoffs that we are recognizing from these investments. We are also trying to recognize when customers may be at risk and putting together different offers that are catered specifically for those customers. So again, those are the ways we are using big data. From a marketing perspective, as we mentioned a couple of quarters ago, we've added an outbound sales team as well as face-to-face sales reps. We've cross trained some sales reps from Shred-It and the field organization to sell both our RMW and Shred-It and we have had some really nice wins, some large wins from those folks as well. So overall I would say the investments are on track. It's early innings but we are pleased with how they started. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay, that's helpful. And then as my follow-up, the strength you saw in document destruction, can you talk a little bit more about what we should be considering for an organic growth rate going forward? I guess, meaning how much of this is kind of one time purge-related activity that benefited the quarter versus the true recurring sales? Thanks. Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. Sure. Overall, we are really pleased with our 8% organic growth. About half of that growth is driven by really solid performance by the team. So that's a combination of our field sales executives that are closing the unvended customers, or customers that currently don't to do service with any provider. The investments we've made in our inside sales team produce really solid one time or purge revenue as well as our national and regional accounts they're having a great deal of success. So all of that related to our overall organic performance. The other part of that was driven by increases in recycling. So overall, I would say our growth goals organically net-of-paper is anywhere from about 3% to 5% and we are well within that range. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks, guys. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Ryan. Operator Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Could I just make sure I understood what you asked there and not use up a question? So 4% of the growth is the year-over-year difference in paper in total, right? As opposed to versus your guidance? Because your guidance has $155 million in there and paper was like $175 million. So I just want understand the delta there. How much was more than your guidance versus... Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, so Michael, if you look at it this way, obviously when we did guidance at the beginning of – at the end of last year, we used $147 million to $167 million. So it's slightly higher today, so you wouldn't attribute all 4% to the high price today, where we ended the quarter I think at $175 million. I'd say 1%, 1% to 2% is probably because of the higher paper prices, because right now we are slightly outside of our upper-end of the range when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. And then can we talk about the margins and, sort of, thinking about what's going on in margin overall and the puts and takes in it? So I don't think anybody should be alarmed if your margins are down, given some of the issues, but can we talk about why they're down? What's the contributions? Like how much of it is M&I having a tough comp. It was profitable a year ago and maybe it's not this year? The pricing issue versus offsets like, I'm assuming you closed some call centers in the patient communication side, that helps margins there. And then like where is recalls and returns? Were those revenues down or were they up year-over-year? What are the puts and takes around the margins? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, Michael. There's a lot of questions in there on that and we'll talk about EBITDA margins specifically, because we could go on all of them. First of all, would like to just share that for the quarter to our guidance, we were slightly ahead of margins. I think our guidance was 19%, we came in at 19.1%. So we're very pleased it came within guidance. I think what you're looking at though when you're comparing margins is probably year-over-year and certainly you would have to factor in things that – we continue to see pricing pressure that didn't exist a year ago at this time. We guided down throughout the course of the year for M&I. Those would've been some the things that are pushing margins down. Further to that, Michael, you'll know in the Investor Day, we spoke specifically about making investments in the business, knowing full well that that would bring up our SG&A for future benefit to be able to make investments in sales resources in Brent's area or make investments in our accounting and shared services and systems in order to drive benefits in the future. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. And if I were to think about how that's split, is it evenly between the operational ones versus the investment ones? Is it two thirds, one third? How do I think about the weight? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. I think I would split it, I think – are you talking between SG&A and gross margin? Or are you just talking in general over the... Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. So, I mean, if RMW and M&I are an operating reason why margins are down and then G&A is an investment reason. What's the split between those two categories, operating and the investment side, for the pressure? Is it split evenly? Is it 60/40? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah. I would put it – without having the specific calculations on that, Michael, I think it's about split evenly. Some are the year-over-year comparatives. The other is the investments that we're making into future growth and stability in the shared service area. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. All right. So, last one. Following up on that last comment, where do you stand on making a decision about a standard – one single ERP picking the -- whatever it's going to be and then starting down the path of that investment? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah. So, as we talked about in the past, one of the first steps we did is we brought in some new talent, a new CIO, who came in in September of last year. Really, his charter early on was to evaluate our systems, to do an analysis of our business and see what systems would fit in. From there, we're really in that design and evaluation phase. I think we will continue to explore that and then from there, we would make a decision on a go or no go and what system would be there. I think that's going to take really throughout the balance of the year for us to be able to fully and adequately analyze what single system would fit Stericycle's environment. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. So from our standpoint, modeling cost wise and/or capital spending related to that, that would be an 2018 event, then. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah. At this point in time, no change to the guidance but that timeline is unknown. If there were any changes in the latter half of the year, we certainly would communicate it at that point. But this is not a simple solution. This is one that would take multiple years to implement at Stericycle. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. And then, what was the recall revenue in the quarter? Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah. The recall revenue in the quarter, Michael, when we give the Communication and Related Services now, the global recall number we use there is $125 million to $150 million globally. We came in slightly better from a global standpoint than Q1 of 2016. I don't have the number because we don't break it out anymore, but with respect to global recalls, we're still in that range for the year, about $125 million to $150 million. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Great. Thanks, Michael. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Michael. Operator Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Oh, thanks. Good afternoon. Could you all provide an update with regard to some of the issues you've had down in Latin America with regard to International business? Just a progress report there, please. Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah. From an international perspective, more specifically, with Latin America, we did see price pressure come in as expected, Scott, in Q1. We are starting to exit some contracts where we just can't make the margin that we expect in that business. So part of the bridge to the previous guidance on revenue and the new guidance, we did take down some revenue with respect to Latin America, but from a pricing pressure, it came in as expected. Overall though, I'm happy to report that from a margin perspective year over year, we had a slight improvement in EBITDA margins and we continue to focus on integration, route density and introducing additional services to help drive growth and profit in the International business. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks. Yeah. And International was a little bit stronger than I would have anticipated. Could you, I guess – I mean, you ticked off a few things. Anything else worth going into there? And I have a follow-up if you've covered it already. Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. No. I think when you look at the headline number for International growth, it was at 2% approximately, but I think when you take out the negative impact, which is the patient transport contract exit and M&I, it comes into about a 5.4%. So I'd say that's normal. As you know, I mean, you've followed the company for a long time, that's about a normal growth rate. We continue to add additional service, like I said, shredding. In the international markets outside of Canada and the US, that falls into the international growth number and they're doing really well in the markets where we have secure information disruption. So that's one of the things that I think is driving some good growth in the international market. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah. I think another thing that we talked about, especially on the Q4 call, was some of the challenges that we were having from a collection standpoint that had readjustment of some of the reserves we had down there. We just recently added an additional resource down there, a credit and collection manager responsible for all of Latin America to really drive discipline down there. Too early to have any results, but really, that's going to have our focus and, hopefully, be able to return to driving some cash flow inbound in that area as well. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up because I heard four international acquisitions in the quarter. Could you just elaborate on those specifically, please? Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Sure. They are – the four international were one, secure information destruction, and three, regulated waste. They were in two in the Netherlands, one in Spain and one in Portugal. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks very much. Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Scott. Operator Your next question comes from Kevin Steinke from Barrington Research. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. Good afternoon. So just wanted to clarify on the guidance for secure information destruction, it appears that did go up by $10 million. So what drove that? Was it acquisitions? Better organic growth? Paper prices? What were the factors driving that higher guidance? Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, Kevin, it was mostly acquisitions and some favorability on FX going forward. Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. Okay. And then just the – it looks like total revenue guidance went up by $20 million. Can you just provide the bridge versus prior guidance on that? Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, it went up to slightly less than that. We raised it about $12 million for the acquisitions and the 2017 effect of those. And then we had a combination in our international business of raising foreign exchange by about $14 million, offset by about $10 million reduction, largely due to what Charlie shared, which is exiting certain contracts in Latin America that just aren't meeting our profitability levels, and as well as exiting one more patient transportation contract. Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. All right. Sounds good. Thanks for taking the questions. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Kevin. Operator Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I guess the first question, in the US Medical Waste business, if we pull out hazardous from it, can you give us a sense. Is your customer count growing in that business? Has it been growing? Or has that been declining? Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. Hey, Gary, this is Brent. I would say it's been modestly growing over the last several years. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. And that hasn't really changed in the last year or so as the pricing pressure and all that's been going on? Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. No, I think the pricing pressure obviously is having an effect on revenue and SQ as we're renewing contracts at discounted rates, but it's not reducing the number of new sites we're bringing on through inbound and outbound selling efforts. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, and part of the investment we talked about, Gary, was the investment in being proactive and more offensively going after new Med Waste contracts which really, most of our SG&A historically has been on upselling, so we are gaining share with respect to sites on SQ. And every year we pick up more sites, more volume, and more customers for our Med Waste operations in the US. That trend hasn't changed. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. And have you seen a return on those investments? Or should we think that's more later this year into next year that you start to see that, the new sales efforts, et cetera, actually driving more clients? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, as we came out with when we made the investments, we really thought that it would take a while for those to get established and we would start to see returns in the latter half of 2017 and into 2018, and I would say that's still the case. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC And then just any commentary or color on the second quarter outlook, what we should expect? If you provided any, I missed it. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, so I think some of the things that you might want to look at here is we've held to our guidance at least for the raise slightly for the year, EPS, I think. Q2 EPS range, I think it's appropriate to be at about $1.10 to $1.16. I think when you looked at the end-quarter EPS result, you saw that we got about a $0.03 benefit from tax. What's important to realize is that was expected, that was built into our tax rate for the year. It got pulled slightly forward to where we experienced the majority of it in Q1, so the caution there is to make sure that we don't just raise from there. I would take about $0.01 out of each of the future quarters that got pulled forward. So $1.10 to $1.16 is a good range to be in from an EPS standpoint going into Q2. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC And then just one more, if I could. I've got a lot of questions about the legal liability from this class-action suit and I'm sure you can't comment on ongoing litigation, but if one were to look at the settlement you made a couple of years ago with what was, as I understand it, a much smaller segment of your customer base, is it reasonable to think that the liability to the current ongoing could be potentially significantly more than that one? Or is there just nothing you can say at this point? Thanks. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, I really can't say anything. I think it's – you can't draw any conclusions to past settlements to future settlements. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thanks, guys. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Gary. Operator Your next question comes from Joel Kaufman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Just any update on the competitive landscape and some of the national or larger regional accounts? I know at the analyst meeting the team felt fairly comfortable that these pockets were well protected from the pricing pressure or competitive pressure. Just wondering if you could provide a status update there? Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. Hey, Joel, I'll take that one. This is Brent. I would tell you that from a national account perspective, there is always pricing pressure, right? Because a lot of our large national customers are in very competitive markets. But I would say that what we do really well is, given the fact that we have multiple services, whether it's in retail and the fact that we can provide medical waste for their on-site clinics or the hazardous retail waste or shredding, we really are able to offer a lot of our national accounts more than one service and have a very good reputation of doing so. So I would say, overall, it's a competitive industry. Renewals can be challenging sometimes, but we offset that with growth of new customers or additional services within existing customers. Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks. Then just a follow-up on that front. I know we haven't focused much on the LQ side of the business, but I would assume that your larger customers are aware of some of the pricing dynamics that are happening on the SQ side of the business. Wondering if this has translated to any incremental pressure in the LQ segment? And maybe what steps you're taking internally to prevent any of those headwinds from manifesting? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, if anything, our LQ business is growing nicely. I mean, we have added additional services. We continue to add new reusable sharps to our Sharps Management Program. Our Pharmaceutical Waste, every quarter, we add new accounts and do new installs there. To Brent's point, we really differentiate the offering. We think we've got a great offering with our secure information destruction service, which virtually every LQ account in healthcare has a requirement for, and they're competitively priced. I mean, historically, they've had lower margins there and GPOs have a place in that process. So we haven't seen anything with respect to pricing pressure. To Brent's point, there's always pricing pressure on the LQ side of the business but that hasn't changed with any of the recent developments that we have seen on the SQ side. Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. And just one more if I can slip it in. Fairly mild winter we had. Just wondering if there was any impact from weather that you could quantify? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. No, not from one of these (31:18) last two winters. I think there was a little bit more weather probably in Q1 of 2016 but even that was a mild winter. No, there's nothing to call out here with respect to weather and the US operations. Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. I think you can see that, Joel, in a great performance if you looked at just net of tax, the EPS coming in at $1.06, slightly above the midpoint of the range. I think we are very pleased with the results of Q1. Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks, guys. Operator Your next question comes from Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review Yes, just wanted to see if you were reaffirming your targets for Shred-It as far as the $20 million in synergies for the year? Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, Jason, it's Brent. Based on the good activity with regard to rolling out standard work, based on the investments we have made in customer service and in inside sales. We are also having continued success at converting from on-site to off-site. Overall, the team has done a really nice job and we are on track to achieve the $20 million in savings in 2017. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review And then as far as your debt levels, is there a target leverage ratio you have for the end of 2017? Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. As we talked about, I mean, we've done a great job of generating cash. If you looked at Q1, it was an incredible cash quarter. Just to caution you for Q2, obviously we make two tax payments in Q2, so to temper your expectations just for Q2. But we are able to take that cash, continue to pay down debt. I think over the course of about a year we have paid about – close to $250 million of debt down. We still anticipate that through normal operations, that we can be approaching and maybe even slightly below three times debt to EBITDA by the end of the year. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review And then finally, just wondered what would be a good number as far as interest expense to use for 2017? Thank you. Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. For interest expense, our guidance has been in the range of $100 million to $104 million. That includes certain expectations for a couple of rate hikes within the year. So I think that's a good range to be. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from Larry Keusch from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks and good afternoon. Could you guys talk a little bit about where you're tracking to the targeted invested amount that you laid out in the guidance for 2017? Is that sort of progressing as you had anticipated through the first quarter? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah, I think what you're talking about is maybe our capital allocation strategy that we provided at the investor day. I think one of those was about $40 million of investments towards the mandatory preferred repo and I'd say we are on track with that. We got $0.05 in the quarter. Our goal was about $0.17, so $0.05 is exactly where we would expect us to be. So I think we're on track there. We had anywhere from, I think, $100 million to $110 million, roughly, or $120 million, for acquisitions. I think if you look at where we're are at now, we might be spending slightly below that, but still getting great tuck-in and acquisitions from a quantity standpoint. And the quality of those, we are very excited about those, so I think we are definitely going to be at or maybe below the range. We'll see how the rest of the year shakes out. And the rest of that is really going towards debt and the cash that we're generating, I'd say, that we're putting at or slightly more debt, paying down debt, than in the expectations. So from a capital allocation strategy, we're very pleased with our progress. Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay, thank you for that. And what about the incremental investments that you are making to fuel the cross-selling activities and such? Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah, Larry, this is Brent. We've made those investments. They are in our current run rate. As we talked about earlier, these were kind of strategic investments we planned on making and we would see payoffs more in the latter part of the year. So we are kind of metering these in, measuring our progress and seeing which ones are worth reinvesting in and which ones we'll stop investing in. Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay, and lastly, I don't know if I missed this or not, I know you indicated the complexion of the acquisitions overseas, but what about the domestic acquisitions? What were those? Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Sure. Well, now it's domestic and Canada, so there were nine total, there were eight shredding, or secure information destruction acquisitions, and one consult. Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. And the split, Larry, to the overall bucket of acquisitions, about 88% falls in the US and Canada, and about 12% falls international. Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Awesome. Thank you. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Great, thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hello. Thank you for the follow-up. If I looked at the $511 million in RMW 1Q 2117 versus the $507 million in 2016, where's the breakout as far as the trend, US, rest of the world? In those two numbers, what was going on? Is the rest of the world up in 2017, but US is down? Or how do I think about that mix? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah, because they are – the Regulated Waste and Compliance and the International line for revenues are little bit different. I would tell you that certainly we're probably up slightly in the US because what falls into that bucket are things like retail, healthcare, hazardous, compliance solutions which, obviously, Michael, is hampered by the pricing. And we've got growth in the international markets, as I said earlier, but obviously, they are negatively impacted by PTS and M&I. But I think if you had to look at the growth and you had it allocated between international and domestic Canada, it would be 50/50. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. So just so I understand... Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Sure. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Was international up more than the US? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. No, I think it's 50/50. There's puts and takes to both international was hampered by the patient transport exit. The US was covered by the SQ pricing. So I think by the end of the day, it's about – split it evenly 50/50 between the US and international. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Rest of the world. Okay. That helps tremendously. All right. Thanks. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Great thanks, Michael. Operator There are no further questions at this time.

Our first question comes from Sean Dodge from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe starting with the SQ pricing, you guys had built $40 million of pressure into 2017. What was the experience during the first quarter and maybe can you talk about how comfortable you still are with a $40 million target for the year? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, thanks, Sean. With respect to Q1, Q1 SQ pricing pressure came in generally as we expected. So there is no change to the assumptions for SQ pricing pressure that we discussed at our investment day this past November. Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC Okay. And then the M&I guidance, it looks like you took that up for the full year despite what kind of looked like a tough start to the year. Can you talk about what happened there and maybe your level of comfort that we'll see an acceleration as the quarters roll on? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes. Actually, Sean, the M&I revenue guidance for the full year is unchanged. It's still $375 million to $395 million. As far as the M&I growth rates in Q1, it generally came in as expected. The results were negatively impacted by an unfavorable Q1 2016 comp, FX, UK divestiture, but with respect to our guidance, it's unchanged. So we think it will come in line for the remainder of the year. Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC Got it. Thanks, again. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Sean. Operator Your next question comes from Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC Yes, thanks for the time, gents. I wanted to start with a question on some the investments you're making in core regulated medical waste on the sales and marketing front. It sounded like in your prepared comments you're already seeing some benefits there. So you can you maybe go through a little bit what you're seeing and what specific areas have driven the most return on investment for the organization? Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. Hey, Ryan, this is Brent. I'll take that one. Let's start with the data analytics piece because that's where we've made a lot of good progress. So far the team has put the tools in place. We've hired some key folks with the technical expertise to help us kind of pull all this together. We are currently using big data and predictive analytics to guide our efforts in a number of areas. I would say one is our lead loads for our sales teams. Another is creating more effective sales offers for our customers. Both of those initiatives, we are seeing improve sales effectiveness for our team. So those are early payoffs that we are recognizing from these investments. We are also trying to recognize when customers may be at risk and putting together different offers that are catered specifically for those customers. So again, those are the ways we are using big data. From a marketing perspective, as we mentioned a couple of quarters ago, we've added an outbound sales team as well as face-to-face sales reps. We've cross trained some sales reps from Shred-It and the field organization to sell both our RMW and Shred-It and we have had some really nice wins, some large wins from those folks as well. So overall I would say the investments are on track. It's early innings but we are pleased with how they started. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay, that's helpful. And then as my follow-up, the strength you saw in document destruction, can you talk a little bit more about what we should be considering for an organic growth rate going forward? I guess, meaning how much of this is kind of one time purge-related activity that benefited the quarter versus the true recurring sales? Thanks. Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. Sure. Overall, we are really pleased with our 8% organic growth. About half of that growth is driven by really solid performance by the team. So that's a combination of our field sales executives that are closing the unvended customers, or customers that currently don't to do service with any provider. The investments we've made in our inside sales team produce really solid one time or purge revenue as well as our national and regional accounts they're having a great deal of success. So all of that related to our overall organic performance. The other part of that was driven by increases in recycling. So overall, I would say our growth goals organically net-of-paper is anywhere from about 3% to 5% and we are well within that range. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks, guys. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Ryan. Operator Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Could I just make sure I understood what you asked there and not use up a question? So 4% of the growth is the year-over-year difference in paper in total, right? As opposed to versus your guidance? Because your guidance has $155 million in there and paper was like $175 million. So I just want understand the delta there. How much was more than your guidance versus... Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, so Michael, if you look at it this way, obviously when we did guidance at the beginning of – at the end of last year, we used $147 million to $167 million. So it's slightly higher today, so you wouldn't attribute all 4% to the high price today, where we ended the quarter I think at $175 million. I'd say 1%, 1% to 2% is probably because of the higher paper prices, because right now we are slightly outside of our upper-end of the range when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. And then can we talk about the margins and, sort of, thinking about what's going on in margin overall and the puts and takes in it? So I don't think anybody should be alarmed if your margins are down, given some of the issues, but can we talk about why they're down? What's the contributions? Like how much of it is M&I having a tough comp. It was profitable a year ago and maybe it's not this year? The pricing issue versus offsets like, I'm assuming you closed some call centers in the patient communication side, that helps margins there. And then like where is recalls and returns? Were those revenues down or were they up year-over-year? What are the puts and takes around the margins? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, Michael. There's a lot of questions in there on that and we'll talk about EBITDA margins specifically, because we could go on all of them. First of all, would like to just share that for the quarter to our guidance, we were slightly ahead of margins. I think our guidance was 19%, we came in at 19.1%. So we're very pleased it came within guidance. I think what you're looking at though when you're comparing margins is probably year-over-year and certainly you would have to factor in things that – we continue to see pricing pressure that didn't exist a year ago at this time. We guided down throughout the course of the year for M&I. Those would've been some the things that are pushing margins down. Further to that, Michael, you'll know in the Investor Day, we spoke specifically about making investments in the business, knowing full well that that would bring up our SG&A for future benefit to be able to make investments in sales resources in Brent's area or make investments in our accounting and shared services and systems in order to drive benefits in the future. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. And if I were to think about how that's split, is it evenly between the operational ones versus the investment ones? Is it two thirds, one third? How do I think about the weight? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. I think I would split it, I think – are you talking between SG&A and gross margin? Or are you just talking in general over the... Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. So, I mean, if RMW and M&I are an operating reason why margins are down and then G&A is an investment reason. What's the split between those two categories, operating and the investment side, for the pressure? Is it split evenly? Is it 60/40? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah. I would put it – without having the specific calculations on that, Michael, I think it's about split evenly. Some are the year-over-year comparatives. The other is the investments that we're making into future growth and stability in the shared service area. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. All right. So, last one. Following up on that last comment, where do you stand on making a decision about a standard – one single ERP picking the -- whatever it's going to be and then starting down the path of that investment? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah. So, as we talked about in the past, one of the first steps we did is we brought in some new talent, a new CIO, who came in in September of last year. Really, his charter early on was to evaluate our systems, to do an analysis of our business and see what systems would fit in. From there, we're really in that design and evaluation phase. I think we will continue to explore that and then from there, we would make a decision on a go or no go and what system would be there. I think that's going to take really throughout the balance of the year for us to be able to fully and adequately analyze what single system would fit Stericycle's environment. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. So from our standpoint, modeling cost wise and/or capital spending related to that, that would be an 2018 event, then. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah. At this point in time, no change to the guidance but that timeline is unknown. If there were any changes in the latter half of the year, we certainly would communicate it at that point. But this is not a simple solution. This is one that would take multiple years to implement at Stericycle. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. And then, what was the recall revenue in the quarter? Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah. The recall revenue in the quarter, Michael, when we give the Communication and Related Services now, the global recall number we use there is $125 million to $150 million globally. We came in slightly better from a global standpoint than Q1 of 2016. I don't have the number because we don't break it out anymore, but with respect to global recalls, we're still in that range for the year, about $125 million to $150 million. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Great. Thanks, Michael. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Michael. Operator Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Oh, thanks. Good afternoon. Could you all provide an update with regard to some of the issues you've had down in Latin America with regard to International business? Just a progress report there, please. Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah. From an international perspective, more specifically, with Latin America, we did see price pressure come in as expected, Scott, in Q1. We are starting to exit some contracts where we just can't make the margin that we expect in that business. So part of the bridge to the previous guidance on revenue and the new guidance, we did take down some revenue with respect to Latin America, but from a pricing pressure, it came in as expected. Overall though, I'm happy to report that from a margin perspective year over year, we had a slight improvement in EBITDA margins and we continue to focus on integration, route density and introducing additional services to help drive growth and profit in the International business. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks. Yeah. And International was a little bit stronger than I would have anticipated. Could you, I guess – I mean, you ticked off a few things. Anything else worth going into there? And I have a follow-up if you've covered it already. Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. No. I think when you look at the headline number for International growth, it was at 2% approximately, but I think when you take out the negative impact, which is the patient transport contract exit and M&I, it comes into about a 5.4%. So I'd say that's normal. As you know, I mean, you've followed the company for a long time, that's about a normal growth rate. We continue to add additional service, like I said, shredding. In the international markets outside of Canada and the US, that falls into the international growth number and they're doing really well in the markets where we have secure information disruption. So that's one of the things that I think is driving some good growth in the international market. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah. I think another thing that we talked about, especially on the Q4 call, was some of the challenges that we were having from a collection standpoint that had readjustment of some of the reserves we had down there. We just recently added an additional resource down there, a credit and collection manager responsible for all of Latin America to really drive discipline down there. Too early to have any results, but really, that's going to have our focus and, hopefully, be able to return to driving some cash flow inbound in that area as well. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up because I heard four international acquisitions in the quarter. Could you just elaborate on those specifically, please? Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Sure. They are – the four international were one, secure information destruction, and three, regulated waste. They were in two in the Netherlands, one in Spain and one in Portugal. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks very much. Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Scott. Operator Your next question comes from Kevin Steinke from Barrington Research. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. Good afternoon. So just wanted to clarify on the guidance for secure information destruction, it appears that did go up by $10 million. So what drove that? Was it acquisitions? Better organic growth? Paper prices? What were the factors driving that higher guidance? Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, Kevin, it was mostly acquisitions and some favorability on FX going forward. Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. Okay. And then just the – it looks like total revenue guidance went up by $20 million. Can you just provide the bridge versus prior guidance on that? Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, it went up to slightly less than that. We raised it about $12 million for the acquisitions and the 2017 effect of those. And then we had a combination in our international business of raising foreign exchange by about $14 million, offset by about $10 million reduction, largely due to what Charlie shared, which is exiting certain contracts in Latin America that just aren't meeting our profitability levels, and as well as exiting one more patient transportation contract. Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. All right. Sounds good. Thanks for taking the questions. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Kevin. Operator Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I guess the first question, in the US Medical Waste business, if we pull out hazardous from it, can you give us a sense. Is your customer count growing in that business? Has it been growing? Or has that been declining? Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. Hey, Gary, this is Brent. I would say it's been modestly growing over the last several years. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. And that hasn't really changed in the last year or so as the pricing pressure and all that's been going on? Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. No, I think the pricing pressure obviously is having an effect on revenue and SQ as we're renewing contracts at discounted rates, but it's not reducing the number of new sites we're bringing on through inbound and outbound selling efforts. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, and part of the investment we talked about, Gary, was the investment in being proactive and more offensively going after new Med Waste contracts which really, most of our SG&A historically has been on upselling, so we are gaining share with respect to sites on SQ. And every year we pick up more sites, more volume, and more customers for our Med Waste operations in the US. That trend hasn't changed. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. And have you seen a return on those investments? Or should we think that's more later this year into next year that you start to see that, the new sales efforts, et cetera, actually driving more clients? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, as we came out with when we made the investments, we really thought that it would take a while for those to get established and we would start to see returns in the latter half of 2017 and into 2018, and I would say that's still the case. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC And then just any commentary or color on the second quarter outlook, what we should expect? If you provided any, I missed it. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, so I think some of the things that you might want to look at here is we've held to our guidance at least for the raise slightly for the year, EPS, I think. Q2 EPS range, I think it's appropriate to be at about $1.10 to $1.16. I think when you looked at the end-quarter EPS result, you saw that we got about a $0.03 benefit from tax. What's important to realize is that was expected, that was built into our tax rate for the year. It got pulled slightly forward to where we experienced the majority of it in Q1, so the caution there is to make sure that we don't just raise from there. I would take about $0.01 out of each of the future quarters that got pulled forward. So $1.10 to $1.16 is a good range to be in from an EPS standpoint going into Q2. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC And then just one more, if I could. I've got a lot of questions about the legal liability from this class-action suit and I'm sure you can't comment on ongoing litigation, but if one were to look at the settlement you made a couple of years ago with what was, as I understand it, a much smaller segment of your customer base, is it reasonable to think that the liability to the current ongoing could be potentially significantly more than that one? Or is there just nothing you can say at this point? Thanks. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, I really can't say anything. I think it's – you can't draw any conclusions to past settlements to future settlements. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thanks, guys. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Gary. Operator Your next question comes from Joel Kaufman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Just any update on the competitive landscape and some of the national or larger regional accounts? I know at the analyst meeting the team felt fairly comfortable that these pockets were well protected from the pricing pressure or competitive pressure. Just wondering if you could provide a status update there? Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. Hey, Joel, I'll take that one. This is Brent. I would tell you that from a national account perspective, there is always pricing pressure, right? Because a lot of our large national customers are in very competitive markets. But I would say that what we do really well is, given the fact that we have multiple services, whether it's in retail and the fact that we can provide medical waste for their on-site clinics or the hazardous retail waste or shredding, we really are able to offer a lot of our national accounts more than one service and have a very good reputation of doing so. So I would say, overall, it's a competitive industry. Renewals can be challenging sometimes, but we offset that with growth of new customers or additional services within existing customers. Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks. Then just a follow-up on that front. I know we haven't focused much on the LQ side of the business, but I would assume that your larger customers are aware of some of the pricing dynamics that are happening on the SQ side of the business. Wondering if this has translated to any incremental pressure in the LQ segment? And maybe what steps you're taking internally to prevent any of those headwinds from manifesting? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, if anything, our LQ business is growing nicely. I mean, we have added additional services. We continue to add new reusable sharps to our Sharps Management Program. Our Pharmaceutical Waste, every quarter, we add new accounts and do new installs there. To Brent's point, we really differentiate the offering. We think we've got a great offering with our secure information destruction service, which virtually every LQ account in healthcare has a requirement for, and they're competitively priced. I mean, historically, they've had lower margins there and GPOs have a place in that process. So we haven't seen anything with respect to pricing pressure. To Brent's point, there's always pricing pressure on the LQ side of the business but that hasn't changed with any of the recent developments that we have seen on the SQ side. Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. And just one more if I can slip it in. Fairly mild winter we had. Just wondering if there was any impact from weather that you could quantify? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. No, not from one of these (31:18) last two winters. I think there was a little bit more weather probably in Q1 of 2016 but even that was a mild winter. No, there's nothing to call out here with respect to weather and the US operations. Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. I think you can see that, Joel, in a great performance if you looked at just net of tax, the EPS coming in at $1.06, slightly above the midpoint of the range. I think we are very pleased with the results of Q1. Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks, guys. Operator Your next question comes from Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review Yes, just wanted to see if you were reaffirming your targets for Shred-It as far as the $20 million in synergies for the year? Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. Yes, Jason, it's Brent. Based on the good activity with regard to rolling out standard work, based on the investments we have made in customer service and in inside sales. We are also having continued success at converting from on-site to off-site. Overall, the team has done a really nice job and we are on track to achieve the $20 million in savings in 2017. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review And then as far as your debt levels, is there a target leverage ratio you have for the end of 2017? Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. As we talked about, I mean, we've done a great job of generating cash. If you looked at Q1, it was an incredible cash quarter. Just to caution you for Q2, obviously we make two tax payments in Q2, so to temper your expectations just for Q2. But we are able to take that cash, continue to pay down debt. I think over the course of about a year we have paid about – close to $250 million of debt down. We still anticipate that through normal operations, that we can be approaching and maybe even slightly below three times debt to EBITDA by the end of the year. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review And then finally, just wondered what would be a good number as far as interest expense to use for 2017? Thank you. Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. For interest expense, our guidance has been in the range of $100 million to $104 million. That includes certain expectations for a couple of rate hikes within the year. So I think that's a good range to be. Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from Larry Keusch from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks and good afternoon. Could you guys talk a little bit about where you're tracking to the targeted invested amount that you laid out in the guidance for 2017? Is that sort of progressing as you had anticipated through the first quarter? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah, I think what you're talking about is maybe our capital allocation strategy that we provided at the investor day. I think one of those was about $40 million of investments towards the mandatory preferred repo and I'd say we are on track with that. We got $0.05 in the quarter. Our goal was about $0.17, so $0.05 is exactly where we would expect us to be. So I think we're on track there. We had anywhere from, I think, $100 million to $110 million, roughly, or $120 million, for acquisitions. I think if you look at where we're are at now, we might be spending slightly below that, but still getting great tuck-in and acquisitions from a quantity standpoint. And the quality of those, we are very excited about those, so I think we are definitely going to be at or maybe below the range. We'll see how the rest of the year shakes out. And the rest of that is really going towards debt and the cash that we're generating, I'd say, that we're putting at or slightly more debt, paying down debt, than in the expectations. So from a capital allocation strategy, we're very pleased with our progress. Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay, thank you for that. And what about the incremental investments that you are making to fuel the cross-selling activities and such? Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah, Larry, this is Brent. We've made those investments. They are in our current run rate. As we talked about earlier, these were kind of strategic investments we planned on making and we would see payoffs more in the latter part of the year. So we are kind of metering these in, measuring our progress and seeing which ones are worth reinvesting in and which ones we'll stop investing in. Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay, and lastly, I don't know if I missed this or not, I know you indicated the complexion of the acquisitions overseas, but what about the domestic acquisitions? What were those? Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. Sure. Well, now it's domestic and Canada, so there were nine total, there were eight shredding, or secure information destruction acquisitions, and one consult. Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc. And the split, Larry, to the overall bucket of acquisitions, about 88% falls in the US and Canada, and about 12% falls international. Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Awesome. Thank you. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Great, thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hello. Thank you for the follow-up. If I looked at the $511 million in RMW 1Q 2117 versus the $507 million in 2016, where's the breakout as far as the trend, US, rest of the world? In those two numbers, what was going on? Is the rest of the world up in 2017, but US is down? Or how do I think about that mix? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Yeah, because they are – the Regulated Waste and Compliance and the International line for revenues are little bit different. I would tell you that certainly we're probably up slightly in the US because what falls into that bucket are things like retail, healthcare, hazardous, compliance solutions which, obviously, Michael, is hampered by the pricing. And we've got growth in the international markets, as I said earlier, but obviously, they are negatively impacted by PTS and M&I. But I think if you had to look at the growth and you had it allocated between international and domestic Canada, it would be 50/50. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. So just so I understand... Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Sure. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Was international up more than the US? Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. No, I think it's 50/50. There's puts and takes to both international was hampered by the patient transport exit. The US was covered by the SQ pricing. So I think by the end of the day, it's about – split it evenly 50/50 between the US and international. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Rest of the world. Okay. That helps tremendously. All right. Thanks. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Great thanks, Michael. Operator There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Charlie Alutto for closing remarks. Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc. Thanks, Kelly. Thank you for joining us today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BioMarin First Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Ms. Traci McCarty, you may begin your conference. Traci McCarty - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This non-confidential presentation contains forward-looking statements about the business prospects of BioMarin Pharmaceutical including expectations regarding BioMarin's financial performance, commercial products and potential future products in different areas of therapeutic research and development. Results may differ materially depending on the progress of BioMarin's products and programs, actions of regulatory authority, availability of capital, future actions in the pharmaceutical markets and developments by competitors, and those factors detailed in BioMarin's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission such as 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K reports. On the call today from the BioMarin management team are J.J. Bienaimé, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Hank Fuchs, President of Global R&D; Dan Spiegelman, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Ajer, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Robert Baffi, Executive Vice President of Technical Operations. I'd like to now turn the call over to BioMarin's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J.J. Bienaimé. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Traci. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. We begin 2017 with a record-breaking quarter and a 28% increase in top line revenues to $304 million driven by the growth of each product in our commercial pipeline. In the quarter, our GAAP net loss was reduced to $16 million and we reported a non-GAAP income of $35 million. In addition in the quarter, our commercial organization not only focused on growing the base business, but also prepared for the launch of our six approved product, Brineura for the treatment of CLN2 which is a form of Batten disease. So we are very pleased to have received this approval last week from the FDA and also a positive CHMP opinion from the European health authorities in the prior week. The collaborative interaction we had with both agencies, who have the review process, illustrates a fairly even therapy that treats rare and ultra rare disorders, not to mention the tremendous unmet medical need for these patients. The flexibility shown by both the U.S. and EU is an important reminder of the value that targeted therapy can make in molecularly well-defined patient population. Our commercial organization has commenced the commercial launch of Brineura in the U.S. and we look forward to starting our commercial rollouts in the rest of the world territories following an approval in Europe, which should come at the end of the second quarter. Needless to say, we are very thrilled for families who are in the need of Brineura, and we wanted to thank everyone who helped execute this rapid approval. For the remainder of 2017, we look forward to advancing all of our development pipeline programs, including BMN 270 gene therapy for hemophilia A. In July at the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis or ISTH in Berlin, we plan to give you an update on this program including data on the seven 6 x 1013 vg/kg high-dose patients all of whom have been already in therapy for at least a year now. We will send our details shortly for investor event on July 10, so stay tuned for more information as we get closer to this event. Later this quarter, we'll be on track to file our BLA for pegvaliase which is our next potential approval, and in addition, the vosoritide and BMN 250 programs continue to advance. In conclusion, we begin 2017 having achieved the goals we anticipated and for the remainder of the year, we look forward to moving all of our patent programs forward, which Hank will review shortly. With last week's approval of Brineura, we now have six commercial products, making BioMarin the pure-play leader in the field of rare and ultra-rare disorders. The financial results announced today demonstrate our commitment to moving toward profitability through our ability to grow the top-line and manage expenses, while still continuing to invest in developing innovative new products for rare and ultra-rare disorders. And now we'll turn the call to Jeff who will review the commercial business in more detail. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, J.J. In addition to being extremely pleased with the financial results in the first quarter, the commercial organization has begun the U.S. launch of Brineura. Bearing in mind the nuances of treating the CLN2 patient population as we shared last week, our strategy is focused on building disease awareness and facilitating diagnosis of children early in the course of the disease. Our ultimate goal is to get children diagnosed when they are candidates that maximally benefit from Brineura. Over time, we anticipate more and earlier diagnosis of CLN2 patients combined with the impact of therapy to lead to a substantial increase in patients for Brineura. Turning briefly to first quarter of 2017 results, we were pleased to announce an increase of 28% year-over-year total BioMarin revenues. Starting with Vimizim, net product revenues increased to $106 million in the quarter, a 45% year-over-year increase primarily driven by 31% growth in new patients on therapy. Some forward buying positively impacted the quarter for markets in the Middle East and South Korea. While we received Q1 orders from Brazil for each of Vimizim and Naglazyme, we continue to expect the inconsistent order patterns could persist from Brazil this year. Year-over-year patient numbers increased by 250, and in the quarter, we added one new market for a total of 42 Vimizim markets. We are extremely pleased with the continued robust commercial uptake of Vimizim and look forward to further penetration in global markets. Turning to Kuvan. Net product revenues increased to $92 million in the quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year driven by strong commercial patient gains of 8% in the U.S. Kuvan business in international markets is performing according to expectations where we are identifying and pursuing growth opportunities. In addition to our EU patent that provides Kuvan exclusivity through 2024 in that important region, we announced on April 13 that we had entered into a settlement agreement with Par Pharmaceutical to resolve patent litigation in the United States providing continued exclusivity to October 2020. We view our leadership in the PKU market with Kuvan as an important opportunity for BioMarin in advance of potential regulatory developments with pegvaliase. Finally, moving to Naglazyme, net product revenues grew to $81 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Patients on Naglazyme therapy continue to show consistent growth with an increase of 9% year-over-year. Growth in the quarter benefited from forward buying in markets in the Middle East and the effect of a Brazil Q1 order this year compared to the absence of an order in Q1 2016. In closing, the commercial team delivered strong results in the first quarter of 2016 with net product revenues 28% higher than the same period last year. We remain on track to meet our full year revenue guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion and reaffirm guidance provided last quarter for individual products. I'm very pleased with the level of demand we are seeing for Vimizim worldwide. Our presence with Kuvan in global markets will be an important factor as we prepare for potential approval and commercialization of pegvaliase, and in addition, we are underway with U.S. launch of Brineura and look forward to launching in the EU upon a decision expected later in the second quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Hank to provide an update on our development programs. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Jeff. And it is hard to believe that I will no longer be including Brineura in my commentary now that it's on its way to being a commercialized product. Needless to say, we're thrilled with the recent FDA approval with a positive CHMP opinion and look forward to helping Jeff seeing brand Brineura to the children who need it as soon as we can. Moving now to development updates for our next potential approved products. All of our pipeline programs advanced to the quarter laying groundwork for their next stage of growth. Starting with pegvaliase for the treatment of phenylketonuria. At our last update, we communicated that U.S. health authorities were interested in additional immunology data and that we had chosen to update the safety database. We are now nearly finished conducting the analyses requested by the Food and Drug Administration, and there's essentially no change in the findings of the program we have shared as part of our pivotal study update last year. That is pegvaliase substantially lowers phenylalanine in patients. As we have said, lowering phenylalanine is primarily dependent on the level of their immune response, which can be safely managed through the induction, titration and maintenance strategies that have been tested in clinical trials. Importantly, longer-term safety data continue to convey tolerability of pegvaliase and continuation on treatment remains strong. We're making plans to incorporate the patient's voice in the review consistent with the Food and Drug Administration's increasing interest in patient-focused drug development. We believe this will be an important aspect of the review as current options for patients are quite limited and relatively unpalatable. Finally, the company is progressing on plans to support post approval commitments as may be deemed necessary during review. All told, we're quite pleased with the progress being made on pegvaliase and look forward to providing further updates as the submissions occur. Turning to vosoritide. When we last updated on progress, we enrolled the first patient on the randomized study that is an important element in establishing the benefit of vosoritide in promoting increased growth velocity. We're now finalizing plans to acquire final adult height data from a current population of achondroplasia, children and adults, to facilitate interpretation of longer term growth outcomes, also known as final adult height, and proportionality. To further our knowledge, we are implementing pilot studies to understand the relationship of height and function, support improvements in patient functionality. We're modifying our infant/toddler program to enable investigation of earlier intervention with vosoritide. Recall that obtaining information about infants and toddlers has become an increasingly important part of BioMarin's genetic disease development programs, evidenced by conducting a small post-approval study with Naglazyme, a larger study with Vimizim, and a small study with Brineura, and now a study in younger children with vosoritide. Most importantly, we continue to believe that vosoritide did present an important option for those patients and families who desire to improve growth outcomes and are unsatisfied with available surgical options in the absence of available medical therapy. And finally, turning to BMS 270 for gene therapy for severe hemophilia A, we have now completed dosing of six patients with a 4 x 1013 vg/kg dose and look forward to having some preliminary efficacy data. The focus of our updated ISTH will be data from patients who had a 6 x 1013 vg/kg dose, many of whom have been on therapy for well over a year. Recall that based on the 6 x 1013 vg/kg data and work by others, it takes roughly 16 to 24 weeks from dosing for Factor VIII levels to reach steady state. And this will be available in the 4 x 1013 vg/kg patients later this year. We're also preparing to update on long-term outcomes, quality of life, steroid use and liver function at ISTH either in presentation and/or at an investor event at the upcoming meeting. On interactions with health authorities, we've completed one round of discussion with the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency on the path to registration, working to harmonize feedback, finalize the program studies to support fastest and best path to approval. On the manufacturing front, we're well past shovels in the ground for our facility and believe material from this facility will be available to be included in the registration enabling study in the spring of 2018. In summary, we are extremely pleased with the productivity coming out of the worldwide development organization. We have learned so much over the past years on how to best focus our development programs to enable rapid and effective drug development in BioMarin. Coming off the recent FDA approval of Brineura after three years and eight months in development, my team and I are more inspired than ever to continue our good work for the benefit of patients with rare and ultra rare disorders. Thank you so much for your support. And I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to review the financial results in more detail. Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Hank. I refer you to today's press release for a full detail summarizing our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. Starting with top line results, as J.J. and Jeff have already described, total BioMarin revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were $304 million driven by strong growth across the entire commercial portfolio. In terms of foreign exchange impacts, year-over-year exchange rate movement did not have a material impact on our Q1 results as losses due to the weakening of the euro and the British pound against the dollar were largely offset by improvements in key Latin American currencies and gains on our hedging contracts. Moreover, we expect that trend to continue for the full-year and do not currently project a significant impact to foreign exchange on full-year revenues in 2017. As Jeff noted, full-year revenue guidance is on-track for $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion, which at the midpoint would reflect the 14% year-over-year revenue increase. The approval of reserve will provide important support towards our goal of ensuring year-over-year revenue increases throughout the remainder of the decade. Moving to operating expenses, R&D expenses decreased to $145 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $158.8 million in the first quarter of 2016 due to the maturing stage of development of our product development portfolio. We would expect R&D expenses to ramp up throughout the remainder of the year primarily due to the increasing enrollment in our vosoritide Phase 3 study, which started at the very end of last year and the start in Q3 of our registration-enabling studies with BMN 270. In addition, there will be increasing R&D investment in BMN 250 studies and in preparations for potentially bringing a new product into the clinic. Expenses in all of these programs should accelerate throughout the year. Furthermore, consistent with our experience after drug approvals, even though Brineura is now approved in the U.S. and potentially in the EU by the end of the quarter, there will still be R&D spending on this product while we seek regulatory and reimbursement approvals throughout our global territories and transition patient onto commercial therapy. Similarly, over 200 patients were made in pegvaliase extension studies as we prosecute regulatory approvals in both the U.S. and Europe. SG&A expenses increased to $120 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $105.3 million in the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase primarily reflected the continued expansion of dividend as well as increased expenses related to ROW Kuvan sales to support of our global PKU franchise. With the launch of Brineura and early preparations for potential 2018 pegvaliase launch, we expect SG&A spending to also increase later in the year. Turning to bottom line results, we reported a $16 million GAAP net loss and $35 million non-GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2017, compared to a GAAP net loss of $83 million and a non-GAAP net loss of $29 million in the first quarter of 2016. Looking forward, due to the timing of the Brineura launch and the ramp up of our BMN 270 gene therapy and vosoritide programs, we expect an increase in both R&D and sales and marketing spending in the later quarters of the year, which will lead to increased quarterly GAAP losses and a decrease in non-GAAP income in the second consecutive quarters of 2017. Those spending will increase throughout the year as these development and commercial programs ramp up, we remain on track for full-year GAAP loss of $140 million to $180 million and non-GAAP income of between $30 million and $70 million. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $1.2 billion compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016. In closing, BioMarin delivered record results with robust sales from Vimizim, Naglazyme and Kuvan, resulting in reduced GAAP net losses and generating GAAP net income in the quarter. We expect the ramp up of our (19:27) pipeline products and the launch of Brineura to impact non-GAAP results in the second quarter with our 2017 non-GAAP expectation for the full-year is unchanged. Looking beyond 2017, we are driving for year-over-year revenue growth through the end of the decade and controlled operating expenses, which increased less than revenue and allows expanding operating margins and increased bottom line results. Now, I would like to open the call for questions and will ask the operator to open the lines. Question-and-Answer Session Operator And our first question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to ask you about pegvaliase with the pending filing you have there. First of all, is it the same division of the FDA that just reviewed Brineura that's going to be looking at pegvaliase as well? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Cory. Yes, this is Hank. Same division, the Division of Gastrointestinal and Inborn Errors Products. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then, I mean at this stage of the game, I realized you're just kind of coming to focus a lot more in the coming months here, but what are your latest thoughts in terms of where you expect regulatory focus to be for this particular application? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. You're right. It's a little bit early to get into exactly where that's going to be. I think qualitatively, it's going to be in fairly similar places like it always is, safety, efficacy, overall benefit and risk. Now, the safety front has been well described. We've created a PEGylated enzyme that has a safety profile that's remarkably similar to our recombinant human products. Efficacy, we achieved Phe lowering in a very substantial portion of patients and only we'll be able to see an indirect evidence of a benefit on neurocognition. And I think the benefit risk concept has to be considered in the light of what's available alternative. And sadly, for so many patients in the PKU arena, there aren't very good alternatives. So medical food is unpalatable and unpleasant, has its own toxicities. And so, we hope that that will be the framework for evaluation during the review, but stay tuned for more considerations. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then last thing, Hank, on this front, when you said you're looking to include, I think you said patient voice into the package. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Can you provide a little more color as to what that means? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So, there are initiatives underway at Food and Drug Administration around patient-centered drug development and bringing patient's voice more in the process. You're familiar with us from the point of view of the open mic session at the Advisory Committees. You're also aware that the frequency of Advisory Committee is probably diminishing as time goes by and is less and less relevant in the rare and ultra-rare disease space. And so, we look for ways to, and so does the Agency, for ways to hear from patients in the development and regulatory process that helps make their interpretation of benefit risk most relevant to the patients, and to do that in a way that is more rich than simply the one hour in the Advisory Committee, which is diminishing in frequency. There are a variety of ways to do that. We have a lot of experience doing it, recently, gained a lot more experience doing that both in the U.S. and the EU with Brineura, and stay tuned for more specifics about that as the time draws closer. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thanks, again, for taking the questions. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank. Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress. Question for Hank, on BMN 250, can you just run through the relationship again between heparan sulfate and neurocognition? And how you think about kind of the importance of some of the non-CNS disease burden going forward? And then just looking at the move from the 30 mg per week to the 300 mg dose, given the striking data that you saw at the lowest dose, what do you think the benefit is of moving to kind of a 10 times that high given that you're already seeing reductions in the biomark onto the normal range? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Andrew. So, heparan sulfate is one of the species of glycosaminoglycans that is not metabolized – tabolized, I should say, (24:39) correctly in the absence of this enzyme, NAGLU, and accumulates in brain cells. And its relationship to neurocognition impairments has really been best studied preclinically in the absence of clinical programs to document relationship between reductions in GAGs and improvements in neurocognitive outcomes. In animal species, what we have shown is that the direct delivery of the enzymes to the brain results in a reduction in measurable levels of heparan sulfate in brain tissues. And it's also accompanied by improvements in physiopathological evidence of neuronal cell health. And so, we think that the reduction by the delivery of the enzyme that's missing (25:36), the clearance of the storage product out of brain cells and the restoration of neural health will translate into resumption of normal cognitive development in MPS IIIB. As regards systemic or non-PNS or somatic manifestation of the disease, there is evidence of somatic impairment in MPS IIIB. Presently these morbidities are not as consequential for the patient as the CNS manifestations, and it's really the CNS manifestation that in today's world caused so much more morbidity. But one could imagine that if we have the same kind of effect on MPS IIIB that we have with that disease that there is the possibility that somatic manifestation for disease could become more pronounced. The modulator of that of course is just how much NAGLU gets into the periphery after an ICV delivery and MPS IIIB. And it's possible that some of the somatic manifestations may not develop, simply because there is some degree of enzyme delivered to the periphery. Stay tuned. It will take a while to learn more about that, and clearly, we'll learn more about that from the use of Brineura in CLN2 disease. And then finally, the rationale for going higher in dose on one level is the Phase 1 study to learn the tolerability of higher doses. And what we don't yet have evidence of about is the quantitative nature of the relationship between certain levels of GAG reductions and improvement in clinical outcomes. We'll be conducting some more preclinical experiments to better understand that. And as to what dose might be taking forward for commercialization, again, it's a little early to speculate about that so stay tuned. Hopefully (27:37). Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. All right. Thank you. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Concise coverage (27:40). Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. No. No. That's great. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Next? Operator And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Co. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. One commercial, then one pipeline. First, on the commercial, you did mention that there were some pull forward of the ordering patterns in Q1. Can you give us some sense of how that's likely to play out for the rest of the year? Is it all going to be felt in Q2 or is it more going to be spread over the subsequent quarters of the year? And then second, on pegvaliase, one for you, Hank. Could you remind us what prompted the FDA to require that the new immunology analysis, was it simply that a lot of time had passed since the trial or was there a more specific question that they informed you about? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Phil. Jeff here. I'll cover the first question. Wanted some evidence of forward buying, which is not unusual for these markets in Middle East, some markets in Asia, Latin America. Usually we don't see the impact of that all at once in the next quarter and we would quantify – as we've estimated that the impact on both Vimizim and Naglazyme to be a combined about $5 million to $10 million in the quarter. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Good. Thanks. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And as to what prompted the Agency's request for additional analysis. It wasn't so much that it was driven by findings and discussions in the time before the BLA submission is driven more by the nature of the substance of the drug product. So to remind you PEG-PAL is phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which is a protein of non-human origin, which is pegylated to reduce the immunologic sequelae of developing an antibody response. The Agency, and it's earlier question we discussed, this is the same review division that is familiar with our Aldurazyme, our Naglazyme, our Vimizim. So, they are quite familiar with the immunologic responses to recombinant human products, but they are not quite as familiar with immunology, the response to a heavily pegylated bacterial product. So, we're talking about something somewhat new and recall also that some of our commentary about working with the DGIEP is that like other review division, they are stretched in for resources. So, knowing that the review time lines are going to be tight, it's really important for them to hit their PDUFA metrics. They have limited vehicles for extending submission reviews through major amendments. The agency requested that we provide as much of the immunology data upfront to facilitate their timely completion of their review. So, it was a negotiated agreement with the Agency about how much to give them in advance and how much to expect them to be undertaking as in process review. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Actually – okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks again for taking my questions. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Sure. Operator And our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding BMN 270, can you comment on steroid tapering or anything new need for steroid use and preliminary thoughts? Have you had any on the pivotal trial design? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, steroid, there is not really much of an update to give. I mean we'll cover this in a little bit more detail at ISTH. Just recall, the last update that we gave, I think the comment was everybody is off steroids, and everybody's liver function except for one patient, is down to normal and the one patient that wasn't already normal was at 45 with an upper limit of 43 or something like that. And so, there really is nothing new to report, and everybody is perking along and stay-tuned for a real update in the mid-year ISTH meeting. As regards the pivotal trial program, and I think there are sort of two poles of consideration. Clearly, one is, is that the potential for benefit is quite substantial in regard to reduction in bleeding episodes, reductions in Factor VIII use, improvement in quality of life related to reduced bleeding, reduced recombinant medications, potentially improved quality of life because of a reduction in bleeding frequency that is not treated as a bleed. For example, visceral bleeds are often not recognized as bleeds. So, there's quite a bit of desire to document that in a pivotal trial to support adoption and reimbursement. And we have every reason to believe given the data that we have obtained so far is that that's what will happen. At the same time, you've got an end point Factor VIII levels, which has got to be viewed as reasonably likely to predict a clinical outcome. And so that could offer an opportunity for an accelerated approval in the United States or conditional marketing authorization in Europe. And the virtue of that pathway is that it enables access to treatment faster than might otherwise be available if the product was approved under a standard approval mechanism. That's why they have accelerated conditional marketing authorizations in the U.S. and EU collectively. So, is it exactly what we settled on for the overall development program? TBD, but I think that's a little bit of color on how we're thinking about the opportunities there. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. And, Hank, just a follow-up here in MPS IIIB. When should we get the next update, and then any updated thoughts on patient epidemiology or the competitive landscape? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, on the competitive landscape front, pretty easy to say that the other folks are I think recognizing what we had recognized, which was direct brain delivery is probably a better idea than other approaches given the existence of a blood brain barrier and the need for relatively dramatic reductions. We are in the process of completing analysis of the patients in the dose escalation phase. We are busy enrolling more patients in the national history study, and ultimately, they'll flow into the treatment study. As to when the next update will be, I don't think we've penciled that out just yet, so stay tuned. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Another question on BMN 250, if you don't mind. So, Hank, I wonder if you could clarify – I know you said it's too early to talk about a final dose, but did you go directly from 30 milligrams to 300 milligrams or were there any interim steps in between? And then can you just clarify, is the expansion phase, they will all – the expansion phase – would that all be at the 300 milligram dose? And then finally on that, what's a reasonable timeframe to expect a neurocog result from that cohort? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So let's see, I'm going to do my best to remember the questions. So the patients were escalated from 30 milligram to 100 milligram to 300 milligram. So there was an intervening dose between 30 milligram and 300 milligram. And all of the patients in the expansion will start at 300 milligram together, the most information we can on the safety of high exposure and also the effects of higher doses on maintenance of GAG lowering. To remind you in the first three patients dosed at 30 milligrams, two out of three had heparan sulfate levels that moved into the normal range. And a third patient's CSF GAG levels moved into the normal arrangement to hover just above the normal range. So, we'd be very keen to see more data on longer term suppression of CSF GAG levels at the higher doses. Now, a timeframe on which to expect that update to be provided, I think again, is a little premature. Some of that has to do with the rate of enrollment in the natural history study. Some that has to do with the rate of transfer of patients from natural history into the drug study. So, it's really premature to speculate on when those data are available. I think also the nature of the question was when can we expect to see neurocog if there is a benefit. And the thing to say about that is that the primary outcome measure here is development. And if we see as good a result as we saw with Brineura, that might happen relatively quickly, but we don't know what magnitude of result we'll observe. So, that's also another complicating factor sort of estimating when there will be an update of relevance on NAGLU. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. So, that was actually my next question is, and maybe one that you're not ready to answer is, are there brackets around the magnitude that you'd need to see, at least in terms of what FDA is looking for or what you think you'd need in terms of neurocog benefit? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes. Well, what I can say is that we think that relatively low order magnitude reductions in CSF GAGs are unlikely to be clinically beneficial. And we based that on animal data that I referenced earlier in which you can't really impact neuronal cell health until you get to substantially more marked degrees of CSF GAG reduction. And we also partly based that on more intermediate impacts on CSF GAGs in MPS II and MPS IIIA, which were not accompanied by overt clinical benefits in patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy delivered via lumbar intrathecal delivery. So, we think that you've got to push GAG levels down pretty far if not as far as you possibly can to achieve the dramatic effect that we like to see. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Joseph Schwartz from Leerink Partners. Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC Great. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could help us understand when we're likely to get the performance of the patients that are getting BMN 270 at the 4 x 1013 vg/kg dose? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, as I said in my prepared comments, based on the observations that me and others have made, it takes about 14 to 26 weeks after gene transfer for liver expression to stabilize. And based on the timing of the doses that were given, we expect the data on 4 x 1013 vg/kg later this year. Now, I think what people are going to try to resolve to is what expectation to have for the ISTH update if the data are not there, what does it mean? It probably would only mean – and I'm saying this because we haven't arrived at any point of stabilization, because the presentation of data will be informed by whether it's officially mature yet as opposed to whether it's too early to make these data available. I would say and just remind people that with those patients, first three patients, we wait a little while before deciding whether to dose the next three patients with the same or higher dose. We dosed the next three patients at that same – what we're calling the mid-dose or 4 x 1013 vg/kg. And you can interpret that was because we're pretty enthusiastic about what we were seeing among the first three patients. As to exact numbers and exactly what's going to get presented and when it's going to get presented, we need to leave a little room for allowing the data to mature, and we're just not there. I know we're eight weeks ahead of the event, but we're just not at the event yet. Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC All right. Okay. And then on vosoritide, it sounds like you were modifying the randomized study, if that's right and then adding some ancillary studies. Can you explain some more about what's going on there? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, it was really more around modified ancillary studies. The trial is in rolling now, one year placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial continuing substantially unmodified as we talked about it in the past. The ancillary studies are a program of studies that we've talked about in the past. We've talked about the functionality, proportionality, final adult height and safety efficacy in infants and toddlers. And as has been our tradition in the past, we usually concentrate on getting the randomized study up and running first, and then we turn our attention to the ancillary studies for the simple reason that the randomized trials usually provide about definitive evidence and the ancillary trials if they require it all for registration are supported at best. And so, the commentary was simply that as regard to final adult heights, we're building more contemporaneous database that relates final adult height in achondroplasia and relates final adult height in achondroplasia to functional outcomes related to proportionality of the functional outcomes. So just giving a little bit more specifics about the objectives of that portion of the program and then a little bit more specifics around the infant and toddler study by saying that it's very important in providing additional evidence of growth benefit as well as potentially neurological benefit of introducing vosoritide. And those modifications for that portion of the program were being undertaken. Now that we have so much more safety and efficacy data from doses in older children. So, again, the big picture is the vosoritide is progressing, randomized control trial underway, ancillary studies in support of decision making by payers by regulators and stay tuned for more updates as those studies get more completely finalized. Operator And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC All right, great. Thanks for taking the question. I have two follow-ups and I think they're more just clarifications. Hank, on vosoritide, can you just talk a little bit about the younger kids studies that you're going to start. I mean is there any dosing work that you need to do there and sort of what's the age range of patients that you were considering and then – or if you don't need it to dose (43:19) physicians to start something where they're going to look at growth velocity. And then, if you could just clarify, because you said a couple of things about BMN 270 data at ISTH. We will see data from 4 x 1013 vg/kg (43:33) cohort and it's just unclear about the scope and size of that data or is it possible that we won't see any data from that cohort? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, we'll take the last part first. It's possible you won't see any data from the cohort. It is also possible that you'll see some data from that cohort and it's just too early even recognizing that it's not that far away from now. Just you want to let the data mature and we don't want to present something potentially misleading as it is maturing. So stay tuned and then we'll do our very best to get you relevant information just as soon as we have it. And then on BMN 111, I don't know that I can be more concretely definite than just as to your questions, we're excited to say more specific. We're evaluating the data that we have on exposure and age to determine if its substantially likely that we would need to have different doses in much younger children. And the age range that we would be considering is – in a randomized trial, you're eligible if you're older than five. But we recognized (44:45) diagnosed, oftentimes either before birth or at birth or shortly after birth, and that families will want to know, is it safe to start vosoritide or when is it safe start vosoritide. Especially given that the earlier you treat a genetic disease, the better your long-term outcome is. So we're scrubbing our safety exposure response data from our existing population. We're endeavoring to push, in partnership with health authorities and our clinician advisers to progressively younger and younger children to establish safety and potentially efficacy. And until that trial is up on clinicaltrials.gov, I think it would be too preliminary to speculate on the exact final clinical (45:34) study. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Operator And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thanks. Just maybe a follow-up or two. On BMN 270, it seems like you and one of your gene therapy competitors might have data in Berlin. Hank, maybe if you could just share with us your thoughts on as we all try to compare across trials, what we should be looking for? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. The non-cheeky answer to that is going to be – well, it's going to sound cheeky no matter how I deliver it. It's going to be the fact – it's how much experience in time do the various assets have under their belt. When we first – I think the picture that we have of BMN 270 now at the year-plus mark is substantially different than where it was at say the half-year mark. I mean just to remind you at R&D Day last year, I think we were presenting that we had gotten an effective gene transfer to some patients, but we're also in the middle of dealing with some liver function test elevations and some regulatory interactions around those liver functions test elevations. And as you flash forward, you realize that all that had settled out and hardly any of that was relevant. So I think, with us positioned so far out in front of the competition, it's going to be a little hard to get apples-to-apples comparisons to seize the time differences the two programs have. I think the second thing is to just remind that, yeah, it can be very difficult in the best of circumstances can compare drugs that were not studied in the same study. And so I suspect that the followers will be talking about how great their evidence is that stacked up against our data. And I would just caution that that's hard to do in even the best of circumstances. Our focus will be on getting our BMN 270 across the finish line and that's what you're going to hear from us. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And if I may just ask a follow-up question in regard to the potential pivotal design for BMN 270, I know you've mentioned annualized bleeding rates. You mentioned Factor VIII levels. Is it possible for you to just maybe opine on the size of those studies and potential duration of a follow-up that the FDA might require? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I can opine on practically anything. So I think you see the stabilization in Factor VIII levels, 14 to 26 weeks, the question I think the health authorities will ask is, is that long enough to be sure that levels aren't going to go dramatically up after that period or dramatically down after that period, but I think you can get a sense of a dramatic effect on Factor VIII expressions in half a year. On bleeding, there have been clinical trials that have led to approvals of products with the half a year of data. My suspicion is that in gene therapy on an important clinical outcome like bleeding, health authorities are going to want to see more than half a year of data on bleeding rate. I think the bigger difference between the two pathways is likely to be sample size. When you can correct the gene expression from less than 1% to in the normal range, it's not going to take a lot of patient sample to document that. If that's going to take a lot of sample sizes to document an 91% reduction in bleeding frequency either although that number could end up being a little bit bigger than the Factor VIII number simply because of the trial design considerations. So stay tuned. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And one question for J.J., if I may. What are the plans for the pediatric review voucher? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. We haven't really decided at this time. A lot of the products we have in development actually would themselves be getting priority review. You don't know this time is pegvaliase will get priority review. So it will be in the equation but that's not the only thing. So, we might look at divesting this voucher, but again, we haven't made any final decision. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I'll start with the first one back to PEG-PAL and kind of anymore consensus about measuring neurocog or anything maybe on the more quantitative side that you can include in the package? And then I have a couple others. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Alethia. I think we've came to the pretty comprehensive story already about what we know about neurocognition which to just remind you is that there is pretty heterogeneous phenotype of cognitive impairment in PKU patients. The predominant form of impairment is inattentiveness, but there are also other neurocognitive manifestations. Some of those include mood disorders like anxiety and depression, but some of those also include dimensions of neurological health like executive function, judgment ability, et cetera. We concentrated on the inattentiveness in the previously conducted pivotal trial for the simple reason that was the most prevalent of the forms. We documented that the neurocognitive impairment in phenylketonuria in adults is not irreversible, but for reasons we don't completely understand, we were unable to document improvement in neurocognitive outcome in patients randomized to withdraw from pegvaliase compared to patients who were maintained on the pegvaliase after achieving a steady pegvaliase dose. That may pertain to the tools and that may pertain to the timeframe. So, we also demonstrated some trends in some of the more quantitative aspects of executive function, specifically computer sets, the tests of processing speed, as an example. We referred to that as CANTAB in our previous communication. And we're working with experts and agency to identify what could be used in a post-approval trial should that be warranted. And I want to remind you from my prepared comments that no definitive path has been determined for the application or for the approval. We are working in parallel with the agency anticipating and wanting to be ready for whatever post-approval commitments come our way. And so we're examining these issues very carefully and closely right now. We haven't settled on exactly what to do next in regard to measuring neurocog in PKU patients. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Great. And so on the gene therapy manufacturing facility, I know you talked about mid-year as kind of timeline. Is there anything else that kind of needs to be done from a regulatory standpoint? Maybe just kind of walk us through the what's next briefly at a time and last steps. And then the last question is probably for Jeff, around – can you talk about potential impact of Kuvan, of generics? Do you think it's like kind of a slope, or do you think it's a cliff and why do you think that thing? Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So let's start with manufacturing. We got Robert Baffi, our Head of Technical Operations here on the line. So Robert, you want to answer that question on gene therapy manufacturing? Robert A. Baffi - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Sure J.J. Thank you. So where we are now with the facility is we've mechanically completed the facilities, that means all the major pieces of equipment have been installed. We go through a commissioning phase which will take approximately two to three months to make sure all equipment is appropriately validated and operational. And then we'll go into production starting in the late part of the third quarter, and eventually, as we produce and characterize that material, we will have to file that facility as with the Agency and that's the main reasons why the timing for bill of material goes into the second quarter of 2018. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Robert. Now Jeff to answer the question on generics? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So Alethia, I think you're referring to what would our expectations be in the U.S. market to... Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC That's right. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. ... the generic entry. And I think that we know very well how to characterize the generic entry for a traditional retail type of pharmaceutical. It's less clear what to expect in the case of Kuvan, because of our unique business model, and because there's not really very many, if any, good analogs to follow of specialty products with closed-loop distribution systems facing generic entry. So anything we have to offer on this one is speculation, but some of the things that we're thinking about are the traditional methods by which generics get rapid penetration and displace the reference brand may not apply here. We may have some advantages favoring Kuvan, based not only on the distribution model, but our relationship with prescribers and patients. And also, we are not underestimating the ability of a generic competitor to find cracks in the model. So, can't provide very specific guidance to you other than saying we don't think it's going to be exactly a traditional cliff like with a standard retail pharmaceutical. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. I also want to add that. I mean, of course, it was going to be depend whether or not pegvaliase (56:27) October 2020 in the U.S. and the extent to which some Kuvan adult patients moved to pegvaliase in the U.S. And also, I just want to remind you that the October 2020 date is only I guess the U.S. market. And for Europe, we think we have market protection until 2024. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Great. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Ying Huang from BoA Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for BMN 270 regulatory path here. Can you clarify whether you have had a meeting or you will schedule a meeting with FDA before you start the potentially pivotal Phase 2b trial? And then under which conditions do you think FDA would deem that trial pivotal? Secondly, maybe for Hank again. You are now assessing the proportionality in the Phase 3 trial for vosoritide but how important is that end point in the regulatory's eyes when you apply for approval pending the positive Phase 3 trial? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. How important is I guess... Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. (57:38) and the risk and the regulatory landscape (57:41). Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So I mentioned that we've had completed one round of interactions between EMA and the FDA. So hopefully that answers have we met with the FDA. And as to the path between now and the initiation of the Phase 2b study or the next study, and further FDA interactions, I probably won't give more specific comments about that until we're closer to the initiation of the clinical trial. Your question about what would be the basis for approval? I think it was, of the next trial that we do and as I laid out, that could be – if that trial is a factoring endpoint, it could lead to an accelerated approval in the U.S., conditional marketing authorization in Europe. If that end point ends up being bleeding rate, that could lead to a full approval in both territories and exactly what mix and what approach we take, we're still in the process of harmonizing the feedback that we've obtained from the different regions. So a fairly normal phase or the process of pivoting from proof-of-concept into registration-enabling trials where we want to get the heaven of the best possible data to support adoption and reimbursement and the fastest regulatory action, so we can get started selling the product to patients. Now, switching the gears and talking about proportionality. The importance of proportionality, I think, is that it's something that defines achondroplasia different than growth hormone deficiency and represents an additional source of morbidity. It is less clearly understood than growth velocity as an outcome variable in statural disorders than proportionality is, but it could be relevant to substantiate that there is benefit for treatment beyond just growing faster. It could be that improving growth improves proportionality, improving growth and proportionality improves functional outcomes. And therefore that could be part of the story of how vosoritide gets approved at the end of the day. Now we're still collecting and doing trials and collecting data, so it's premature to speculate on what the outcomes of those trials will be, what significant regulatory review of those trial results is going to be taken for all of that. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Martin Auster from UBS. Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a follow-up on the BMN 270 manufacturing discussion that was laid out a little bit earlier. You spoke of a roughly nine-month timeframe between product production in Q3 of 2017 until Q2 2018 when the product from the new manufacturing facility could be introduced into the study. I just wanted to confirm that you intend to use the commercial produced product into the registration study? And also kind of, if you can comment on kind of your confidence level around that roughly nine-month timeframe and any key gating steps in that process? Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. I'll start and then again, Hank and Robert can provide their perspective. It says on the big picture plan here when we said we anticipate starting the single trial (01:01:59) in Q3 at the time. And of course based on the timelines for the new facility, when we start that trial, we cannot use material from the new facility yet. So the plan in that case is to use material from a supplier that's used for the same process as the one we intend to use in the new facility but at a different scale, and it would be a larger scale in the new facility. Now, our intent is that to start sourcing, the product can be used in the field trial in the spring of next year from the new facility, and at the same time, anticipate to show comparability between the material provided from the current supplier and the new facility material. Should we be unable to show comparability between the two materials, then our current plan would be just to extend the field trials so as to enroll a sufficient number of patients from the new facility to still get approval with just patients treated from the new facility which will be the commercial scale and commercial process. Let's get out the big picture. Hank, do you want to add anything to that for Robert? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, so one thing I would add – that's exactly the right description. You can think about what factors would cause an agency to be concerned about scale up and what factors would cause them to be unconcerned. So the better our comparability data, the less concerned they'll be and more willing they might be to accept the pooling of data from the two different sources. And then another aspect of consideration will be what's the relative benefit? And I think you can tell from the fact that we've received prime designation from the EMA, that there's a clearly clear recognition that the potential benefit of gene therapy is huge. So I think our view is, is that that's a reason to believe that we might be able to pool the results from studies of teams of the smaller scale same process with larger scale same process, but as J.J. laid out, stay tuned for how that action turns out. Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Afternoon guys. Thanks for the question. You had another one on BMN 270. So Hank, I know you've had some preliminary regulatory discussions but I was just curious if you had any thoughts on there being any major differences and how the U.S. versus EU versus Japan, for example, the attitudes on risk benefit for BMN 270 and maybe some of the goal post that they would look for on the safety side, are there subtle differences that you'd expect or can you use the single trial across the globe to support approval? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, I think you just put your finger on the pulse of it. In the rare disease space, I think (1:04:38) has recognized the challenge of having region-specific trials. And part of the prime process is for them to be able to touch all the different corners of their process as early in the process as possible to facilitate that harmonization between the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration. Japan, we don't have as much experience with gene therapy just yet. So, my comments will be confined with the EMA and the FDA. My expectation is that the differences will be more subtle than they are major, but having this in the details and again you have to stay tuned to see how we're going to harmonize those various details. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Raju Prasad from William Blair. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Thanks for taking the question. Hank, we've spoken to the few KOLs that showed a little bit concern on factor levels above 125%. Is that something that came up in regulatory discussions that you've had? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I think the important thing to remember is just that we have a trial that allowed us to treat patients with that 5 x 1013 vg/kg dose that produced for one patient who's factor levels were above the upper limit normal. I'm not sure I know where the famous 125% or 120% (01:06:11). I mean that value is in the normal range. So I'm not sure where that concern emanated from. What we've said is that one out of our seven high-dose patients had stabilized around 250% and the remainder are below that upper limit of normal. So we've talked about what the ethno-immunologic evidence for how to evaluate the consequence that are and have characterized that as being fairly negligible. Having said that, we don't expect that every KOL is going to have the same opinion of the data on being number one and that it will take more and sample size longer-term follow-up to accumulate more data that will ultimately bring all prescribers into – or as many as possible into the viewfinder for prescribers as – prescribers of gene therapy. So we're pretty comfortable with the outcome of program so far from a health authority perspective. Stay tuned for more details about the program. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. And then... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And this is in the context, if I may add, of where we stand now is – or the patients that have been treated with a high dose where we indeed had one patient that was above 150% which is upper limit (01:07:42). That's why we real puzzled by this 125% because as Hank said it is still within normal range, so we know where it comes from. Just in the context of patients that have not had any (01:07:54) or any need for recombinant Factor VIII infusion since July of last year. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. And then just a quick one, the manufacturing facility. Can you give some more color on the capacity days we have as far as – will you guys be able to produce other vectors aside from the ones you used for BMN 270? I just asked this because I think J.J. you've mentioned potentially disclosing another gene therapy candidate this year. Is that still the plan? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. As to next IND candidates, we tend not to talk about them until we talk about them and we haven't talk about them. We said, we recognized, we have a leadership position in gene therapy that might predispose us. And at the same time, there are other potentially very large orphans that could be of interest to BioMarin. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So, we – seen another way, our gene therapies would probably be an important component of our future. At this time we don't really have any intention to turn into a pure gene therapy company. And we have internal research efforts and also business development efforts that also could potentially and likely will identify non-generic gene therapy solution to some rare and ultra-rare disorders that have no available therapy today. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. Thanks for the question. Operator And our next question comes from Jing He from Gabelli. Jing He - G.research LLC Thanks of taking the question. So on BMN 270, would you expect to have enough data from 4 x 1013 before starting Phase 2b. Should we expect an update on Q3? And also on Brineura, it's early days but just wondering if you've got any feedback from payers, especially on pricing. Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I'm just wondering, are we going to have some data I think that's what I heard on the 4 x 1013 addition before making a decision on the final design of the pivotal trial? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Of course. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes, we will and we have an ongoing study of 4 x 1013. We have dosed 70 patients at 6 x 1013. As to whether that's sufficient or we need more dose finding, TBD. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And on your second question, the launch of Brineura just got under way, essentially this week. We've announced the price. We have some patients that are commercially in motion. We don't have any response yet from payers. Jing He - G.research LLC Great. Thanks. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for question. I will now turn the call back over to CEO and Chairman, J.J. Bienaimé for closing remarks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, operator. So in summary, we start 2017 from a position of strength. We've been delivering a record quarter of $304 million in total BioMarin revenues. We've seen a 28% growth year-over-year. We got out sixth product approved, Brineura by the U.S. FDA. And it's in the process of being introduced probably at the beginning of June and potentially soon thereafter in Europe. Of course, upon a anticipated positive opinion there in June. Regarding our gene therapy program, it's moving forward and towards a registration-enabling study. Our pegvaliase is on the horizon and on track for a late Q2 filing. And continuing enrollments of our vosoritide and BMN 250 programs is (01:11:49). And so we look forward to continued success out of our worldwide development organizations. And we thank you for your continuous support and for joining us on today's call.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator And our first question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to ask you about pegvaliase with the pending filing you have there. First of all, is it the same division of the FDA that just reviewed Brineura that's going to be looking at pegvaliase as well? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Cory. Yes, this is Hank. Same division, the Division of Gastrointestinal and Inborn Errors Products. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then, I mean at this stage of the game, I realized you're just kind of coming to focus a lot more in the coming months here, but what are your latest thoughts in terms of where you expect regulatory focus to be for this particular application? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. You're right. It's a little bit early to get into exactly where that's going to be. I think qualitatively, it's going to be in fairly similar places like it always is, safety, efficacy, overall benefit and risk. Now, the safety front has been well described. We've created a PEGylated enzyme that has a safety profile that's remarkably similar to our recombinant human products. Efficacy, we achieved Phe lowering in a very substantial portion of patients and only we'll be able to see an indirect evidence of a benefit on neurocognition. And I think the benefit risk concept has to be considered in the light of what's available alternative. And sadly, for so many patients in the PKU arena, there aren't very good alternatives. So medical food is unpalatable and unpleasant, has its own toxicities. And so, we hope that that will be the framework for evaluation during the review, but stay tuned for more considerations. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then last thing, Hank, on this front, when you said you're looking to include, I think you said patient voice into the package. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Can you provide a little more color as to what that means? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So, there are initiatives underway at Food and Drug Administration around patient-centered drug development and bringing patient's voice more in the process. You're familiar with us from the point of view of the open mic session at the Advisory Committees. You're also aware that the frequency of Advisory Committee is probably diminishing as time goes by and is less and less relevant in the rare and ultra-rare disease space. And so, we look for ways to, and so does the Agency, for ways to hear from patients in the development and regulatory process that helps make their interpretation of benefit risk most relevant to the patients, and to do that in a way that is more rich than simply the one hour in the Advisory Committee, which is diminishing in frequency. There are a variety of ways to do that. We have a lot of experience doing it, recently, gained a lot more experience doing that both in the U.S. and the EU with Brineura, and stay tuned for more specifics about that as the time draws closer. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thanks, again, for taking the questions. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank. Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress. Question for Hank, on BMN 250, can you just run through the relationship again between heparan sulfate and neurocognition? And how you think about kind of the importance of some of the non-CNS disease burden going forward? And then just looking at the move from the 30 mg per week to the 300 mg dose, given the striking data that you saw at the lowest dose, what do you think the benefit is of moving to kind of a 10 times that high given that you're already seeing reductions in the biomark onto the normal range? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Andrew. So, heparan sulfate is one of the species of glycosaminoglycans that is not metabolized – tabolized, I should say, (24:39) correctly in the absence of this enzyme, NAGLU, and accumulates in brain cells. And its relationship to neurocognition impairments has really been best studied preclinically in the absence of clinical programs to document relationship between reductions in GAGs and improvements in neurocognitive outcomes. In animal species, what we have shown is that the direct delivery of the enzymes to the brain results in a reduction in measurable levels of heparan sulfate in brain tissues. And it's also accompanied by improvements in physiopathological evidence of neuronal cell health. And so, we think that the reduction by the delivery of the enzyme that's missing (25:36), the clearance of the storage product out of brain cells and the restoration of neural health will translate into resumption of normal cognitive development in MPS IIIB. As regards systemic or non-PNS or somatic manifestation of the disease, there is evidence of somatic impairment in MPS IIIB. Presently these morbidities are not as consequential for the patient as the CNS manifestations, and it's really the CNS manifestation that in today's world caused so much more morbidity. But one could imagine that if we have the same kind of effect on MPS IIIB that we have with that disease that there is the possibility that somatic manifestation for disease could become more pronounced. The modulator of that of course is just how much NAGLU gets into the periphery after an ICV delivery and MPS IIIB. And it's possible that some of the somatic manifestations may not develop, simply because there is some degree of enzyme delivered to the periphery. Stay tuned. It will take a while to learn more about that, and clearly, we'll learn more about that from the use of Brineura in CLN2 disease. And then finally, the rationale for going higher in dose on one level is the Phase 1 study to learn the tolerability of higher doses. And what we don't yet have evidence of about is the quantitative nature of the relationship between certain levels of GAG reductions and improvement in clinical outcomes. We'll be conducting some more preclinical experiments to better understand that. And as to what dose might be taking forward for commercialization, again, it's a little early to speculate about that so stay tuned. Hopefully (27:37). Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. All right. Thank you. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Concise coverage (27:40). Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. No. No. That's great. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Next? Operator And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Co. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. One commercial, then one pipeline. First, on the commercial, you did mention that there were some pull forward of the ordering patterns in Q1. Can you give us some sense of how that's likely to play out for the rest of the year? Is it all going to be felt in Q2 or is it more going to be spread over the subsequent quarters of the year? And then second, on pegvaliase, one for you, Hank. Could you remind us what prompted the FDA to require that the new immunology analysis, was it simply that a lot of time had passed since the trial or was there a more specific question that they informed you about? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Phil. Jeff here. I'll cover the first question. Wanted some evidence of forward buying, which is not unusual for these markets in Middle East, some markets in Asia, Latin America. Usually we don't see the impact of that all at once in the next quarter and we would quantify – as we've estimated that the impact on both Vimizim and Naglazyme to be a combined about $5 million to $10 million in the quarter. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Good. Thanks. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And as to what prompted the Agency's request for additional analysis. It wasn't so much that it was driven by findings and discussions in the time before the BLA submission is driven more by the nature of the substance of the drug product. So to remind you PEG-PAL is phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which is a protein of non-human origin, which is pegylated to reduce the immunologic sequelae of developing an antibody response. The Agency, and it's earlier question we discussed, this is the same review division that is familiar with our Aldurazyme, our Naglazyme, our Vimizim. So, they are quite familiar with the immunologic responses to recombinant human products, but they are not quite as familiar with immunology, the response to a heavily pegylated bacterial product. So, we're talking about something somewhat new and recall also that some of our commentary about working with the DGIEP is that like other review division, they are stretched in for resources. So, knowing that the review time lines are going to be tight, it's really important for them to hit their PDUFA metrics. They have limited vehicles for extending submission reviews through major amendments. The agency requested that we provide as much of the immunology data upfront to facilitate their timely completion of their review. So, it was a negotiated agreement with the Agency about how much to give them in advance and how much to expect them to be undertaking as in process review. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Actually – okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks again for taking my questions. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Sure. Operator And our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding BMN 270, can you comment on steroid tapering or anything new need for steroid use and preliminary thoughts? Have you had any on the pivotal trial design? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, steroid, there is not really much of an update to give. I mean we'll cover this in a little bit more detail at ISTH. Just recall, the last update that we gave, I think the comment was everybody is off steroids, and everybody's liver function except for one patient, is down to normal and the one patient that wasn't already normal was at 45 with an upper limit of 43 or something like that. And so, there really is nothing new to report, and everybody is perking along and stay-tuned for a real update in the mid-year ISTH meeting. As regards the pivotal trial program, and I think there are sort of two poles of consideration. Clearly, one is, is that the potential for benefit is quite substantial in regard to reduction in bleeding episodes, reductions in Factor VIII use, improvement in quality of life related to reduced bleeding, reduced recombinant medications, potentially improved quality of life because of a reduction in bleeding frequency that is not treated as a bleed. For example, visceral bleeds are often not recognized as bleeds. So, there's quite a bit of desire to document that in a pivotal trial to support adoption and reimbursement. And we have every reason to believe given the data that we have obtained so far is that that's what will happen. At the same time, you've got an end point Factor VIII levels, which has got to be viewed as reasonably likely to predict a clinical outcome. And so that could offer an opportunity for an accelerated approval in the United States or conditional marketing authorization in Europe. And the virtue of that pathway is that it enables access to treatment faster than might otherwise be available if the product was approved under a standard approval mechanism. That's why they have accelerated conditional marketing authorizations in the U.S. and EU collectively. So, is it exactly what we settled on for the overall development program? TBD, but I think that's a little bit of color on how we're thinking about the opportunities there. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. And, Hank, just a follow-up here in MPS IIIB. When should we get the next update, and then any updated thoughts on patient epidemiology or the competitive landscape? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, on the competitive landscape front, pretty easy to say that the other folks are I think recognizing what we had recognized, which was direct brain delivery is probably a better idea than other approaches given the existence of a blood brain barrier and the need for relatively dramatic reductions. We are in the process of completing analysis of the patients in the dose escalation phase. We are busy enrolling more patients in the national history study, and ultimately, they'll flow into the treatment study. As to when the next update will be, I don't think we've penciled that out just yet, so stay tuned. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Another question on BMN 250, if you don't mind. So, Hank, I wonder if you could clarify – I know you said it's too early to talk about a final dose, but did you go directly from 30 milligrams to 300 milligrams or were there any interim steps in between? And then can you just clarify, is the expansion phase, they will all – the expansion phase – would that all be at the 300 milligram dose? And then finally on that, what's a reasonable timeframe to expect a neurocog result from that cohort? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So let's see, I'm going to do my best to remember the questions. So the patients were escalated from 30 milligram to 100 milligram to 300 milligram. So there was an intervening dose between 30 milligram and 300 milligram. And all of the patients in the expansion will start at 300 milligram together, the most information we can on the safety of high exposure and also the effects of higher doses on maintenance of GAG lowering. To remind you in the first three patients dosed at 30 milligrams, two out of three had heparan sulfate levels that moved into the normal range. And a third patient's CSF GAG levels moved into the normal arrangement to hover just above the normal range. So, we'd be very keen to see more data on longer term suppression of CSF GAG levels at the higher doses. Now, a timeframe on which to expect that update to be provided, I think again, is a little premature. Some of that has to do with the rate of enrollment in the natural history study. Some that has to do with the rate of transfer of patients from natural history into the drug study. So, it's really premature to speculate on when those data are available. I think also the nature of the question was when can we expect to see neurocog if there is a benefit. And the thing to say about that is that the primary outcome measure here is development. And if we see as good a result as we saw with Brineura, that might happen relatively quickly, but we don't know what magnitude of result we'll observe. So, that's also another complicating factor sort of estimating when there will be an update of relevance on NAGLU. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. So, that was actually my next question is, and maybe one that you're not ready to answer is, are there brackets around the magnitude that you'd need to see, at least in terms of what FDA is looking for or what you think you'd need in terms of neurocog benefit? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes. Well, what I can say is that we think that relatively low order magnitude reductions in CSF GAGs are unlikely to be clinically beneficial. And we based that on animal data that I referenced earlier in which you can't really impact neuronal cell health until you get to substantially more marked degrees of CSF GAG reduction. And we also partly based that on more intermediate impacts on CSF GAGs in MPS II and MPS IIIA, which were not accompanied by overt clinical benefits in patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy delivered via lumbar intrathecal delivery. So, we think that you've got to push GAG levels down pretty far if not as far as you possibly can to achieve the dramatic effect that we like to see. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Joseph Schwartz from Leerink Partners. Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC Great. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could help us understand when we're likely to get the performance of the patients that are getting BMN 270 at the 4 x 1013 vg/kg dose? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, as I said in my prepared comments, based on the observations that me and others have made, it takes about 14 to 26 weeks after gene transfer for liver expression to stabilize. And based on the timing of the doses that were given, we expect the data on 4 x 1013 vg/kg later this year. Now, I think what people are going to try to resolve to is what expectation to have for the ISTH update if the data are not there, what does it mean? It probably would only mean – and I'm saying this because we haven't arrived at any point of stabilization, because the presentation of data will be informed by whether it's officially mature yet as opposed to whether it's too early to make these data available. I would say and just remind people that with those patients, first three patients, we wait a little while before deciding whether to dose the next three patients with the same or higher dose. We dosed the next three patients at that same – what we're calling the mid-dose or 4 x 1013 vg/kg. And you can interpret that was because we're pretty enthusiastic about what we were seeing among the first three patients. As to exact numbers and exactly what's going to get presented and when it's going to get presented, we need to leave a little room for allowing the data to mature, and we're just not there. I know we're eight weeks ahead of the event, but we're just not at the event yet. Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC All right. Okay. And then on vosoritide, it sounds like you were modifying the randomized study, if that's right and then adding some ancillary studies. Can you explain some more about what's going on there? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, it was really more around modified ancillary studies. The trial is in rolling now, one year placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial continuing substantially unmodified as we talked about it in the past. The ancillary studies are a program of studies that we've talked about in the past. We've talked about the functionality, proportionality, final adult height and safety efficacy in infants and toddlers. And as has been our tradition in the past, we usually concentrate on getting the randomized study up and running first, and then we turn our attention to the ancillary studies for the simple reason that the randomized trials usually provide about definitive evidence and the ancillary trials if they require it all for registration are supported at best. And so, the commentary was simply that as regard to final adult heights, we're building more contemporaneous database that relates final adult height in achondroplasia and relates final adult height in achondroplasia to functional outcomes related to proportionality of the functional outcomes. So just giving a little bit more specifics about the objectives of that portion of the program and then a little bit more specifics around the infant and toddler study by saying that it's very important in providing additional evidence of growth benefit as well as potentially neurological benefit of introducing vosoritide. And those modifications for that portion of the program were being undertaken. Now that we have so much more safety and efficacy data from doses in older children. So, again, the big picture is the vosoritide is progressing, randomized control trial underway, ancillary studies in support of decision making by payers by regulators and stay tuned for more updates as those studies get more completely finalized. Operator And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC All right, great. Thanks for taking the question. I have two follow-ups and I think they're more just clarifications. Hank, on vosoritide, can you just talk a little bit about the younger kids studies that you're going to start. I mean is there any dosing work that you need to do there and sort of what's the age range of patients that you were considering and then – or if you don't need it to dose (43:19) physicians to start something where they're going to look at growth velocity. And then, if you could just clarify, because you said a couple of things about BMN 270 data at ISTH. We will see data from 4 x 1013 vg/kg (43:33) cohort and it's just unclear about the scope and size of that data or is it possible that we won't see any data from that cohort? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, we'll take the last part first. It's possible you won't see any data from the cohort. It is also possible that you'll see some data from that cohort and it's just too early even recognizing that it's not that far away from now. Just you want to let the data mature and we don't want to present something potentially misleading as it is maturing. So stay tuned and then we'll do our very best to get you relevant information just as soon as we have it. And then on BMN 111, I don't know that I can be more concretely definite than just as to your questions, we're excited to say more specific. We're evaluating the data that we have on exposure and age to determine if its substantially likely that we would need to have different doses in much younger children. And the age range that we would be considering is – in a randomized trial, you're eligible if you're older than five. But we recognized (44:45) diagnosed, oftentimes either before birth or at birth or shortly after birth, and that families will want to know, is it safe to start vosoritide or when is it safe start vosoritide. Especially given that the earlier you treat a genetic disease, the better your long-term outcome is. So we're scrubbing our safety exposure response data from our existing population. We're endeavoring to push, in partnership with health authorities and our clinician advisers to progressively younger and younger children to establish safety and potentially efficacy. And until that trial is up on clinicaltrials.gov, I think it would be too preliminary to speculate on the exact final clinical (45:34) study. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Operator And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thanks. Just maybe a follow-up or two. On BMN 270, it seems like you and one of your gene therapy competitors might have data in Berlin. Hank, maybe if you could just share with us your thoughts on as we all try to compare across trials, what we should be looking for? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. The non-cheeky answer to that is going to be – well, it's going to sound cheeky no matter how I deliver it. It's going to be the fact – it's how much experience in time do the various assets have under their belt. When we first – I think the picture that we have of BMN 270 now at the year-plus mark is substantially different than where it was at say the half-year mark. I mean just to remind you at R&D Day last year, I think we were presenting that we had gotten an effective gene transfer to some patients, but we're also in the middle of dealing with some liver function test elevations and some regulatory interactions around those liver functions test elevations. And as you flash forward, you realize that all that had settled out and hardly any of that was relevant. So I think, with us positioned so far out in front of the competition, it's going to be a little hard to get apples-to-apples comparisons to seize the time differences the two programs have. I think the second thing is to just remind that, yeah, it can be very difficult in the best of circumstances can compare drugs that were not studied in the same study. And so I suspect that the followers will be talking about how great their evidence is that stacked up against our data. And I would just caution that that's hard to do in even the best of circumstances. Our focus will be on getting our BMN 270 across the finish line and that's what you're going to hear from us. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And if I may just ask a follow-up question in regard to the potential pivotal design for BMN 270, I know you've mentioned annualized bleeding rates. You mentioned Factor VIII levels. Is it possible for you to just maybe opine on the size of those studies and potential duration of a follow-up that the FDA might require? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I can opine on practically anything. So I think you see the stabilization in Factor VIII levels, 14 to 26 weeks, the question I think the health authorities will ask is, is that long enough to be sure that levels aren't going to go dramatically up after that period or dramatically down after that period, but I think you can get a sense of a dramatic effect on Factor VIII expressions in half a year. On bleeding, there have been clinical trials that have led to approvals of products with the half a year of data. My suspicion is that in gene therapy on an important clinical outcome like bleeding, health authorities are going to want to see more than half a year of data on bleeding rate. I think the bigger difference between the two pathways is likely to be sample size. When you can correct the gene expression from less than 1% to in the normal range, it's not going to take a lot of patient sample to document that. If that's going to take a lot of sample sizes to document an 91% reduction in bleeding frequency either although that number could end up being a little bit bigger than the Factor VIII number simply because of the trial design considerations. So stay tuned. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And one question for J.J., if I may. What are the plans for the pediatric review voucher? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. We haven't really decided at this time. A lot of the products we have in development actually would themselves be getting priority review. You don't know this time is pegvaliase will get priority review. So it will be in the equation but that's not the only thing. So, we might look at divesting this voucher, but again, we haven't made any final decision. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I'll start with the first one back to PEG-PAL and kind of anymore consensus about measuring neurocog or anything maybe on the more quantitative side that you can include in the package? And then I have a couple others. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Alethia. I think we've came to the pretty comprehensive story already about what we know about neurocognition which to just remind you is that there is pretty heterogeneous phenotype of cognitive impairment in PKU patients. The predominant form of impairment is inattentiveness, but there are also other neurocognitive manifestations. Some of those include mood disorders like anxiety and depression, but some of those also include dimensions of neurological health like executive function, judgment ability, et cetera. We concentrated on the inattentiveness in the previously conducted pivotal trial for the simple reason that was the most prevalent of the forms. We documented that the neurocognitive impairment in phenylketonuria in adults is not irreversible, but for reasons we don't completely understand, we were unable to document improvement in neurocognitive outcome in patients randomized to withdraw from pegvaliase compared to patients who were maintained on the pegvaliase after achieving a steady pegvaliase dose. That may pertain to the tools and that may pertain to the timeframe. So, we also demonstrated some trends in some of the more quantitative aspects of executive function, specifically computer sets, the tests of processing speed, as an example. We referred to that as CANTAB in our previous communication. And we're working with experts and agency to identify what could be used in a post-approval trial should that be warranted. And I want to remind you from my prepared comments that no definitive path has been determined for the application or for the approval. We are working in parallel with the agency anticipating and wanting to be ready for whatever post-approval commitments come our way. And so we're examining these issues very carefully and closely right now. We haven't settled on exactly what to do next in regard to measuring neurocog in PKU patients. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Great. And so on the gene therapy manufacturing facility, I know you talked about mid-year as kind of timeline. Is there anything else that kind of needs to be done from a regulatory standpoint? Maybe just kind of walk us through the what's next briefly at a time and last steps. And then the last question is probably for Jeff, around – can you talk about potential impact of Kuvan, of generics? Do you think it's like kind of a slope, or do you think it's a cliff and why do you think that thing? Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So let's start with manufacturing. We got Robert Baffi, our Head of Technical Operations here on the line. So Robert, you want to answer that question on gene therapy manufacturing? Robert A. Baffi - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Sure J.J. Thank you. So where we are now with the facility is we've mechanically completed the facilities, that means all the major pieces of equipment have been installed. We go through a commissioning phase which will take approximately two to three months to make sure all equipment is appropriately validated and operational. And then we'll go into production starting in the late part of the third quarter, and eventually, as we produce and characterize that material, we will have to file that facility as with the Agency and that's the main reasons why the timing for bill of material goes into the second quarter of 2018. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Robert. Now Jeff to answer the question on generics? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So Alethia, I think you're referring to what would our expectations be in the U.S. market to... Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC That's right. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. ... the generic entry. And I think that we know very well how to characterize the generic entry for a traditional retail type of pharmaceutical. It's less clear what to expect in the case of Kuvan, because of our unique business model, and because there's not really very many, if any, good analogs to follow of specialty products with closed-loop distribution systems facing generic entry. So anything we have to offer on this one is speculation, but some of the things that we're thinking about are the traditional methods by which generics get rapid penetration and displace the reference brand may not apply here. We may have some advantages favoring Kuvan, based not only on the distribution model, but our relationship with prescribers and patients. And also, we are not underestimating the ability of a generic competitor to find cracks in the model. So, can't provide very specific guidance to you other than saying we don't think it's going to be exactly a traditional cliff like with a standard retail pharmaceutical. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. I also want to add that. I mean, of course, it was going to be depend whether or not pegvaliase (56:27) October 2020 in the U.S. and the extent to which some Kuvan adult patients moved to pegvaliase in the U.S. And also, I just want to remind you that the October 2020 date is only I guess the U.S. market. And for Europe, we think we have market protection until 2024. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Great. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Ying Huang from BoA Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for BMN 270 regulatory path here. Can you clarify whether you have had a meeting or you will schedule a meeting with FDA before you start the potentially pivotal Phase 2b trial? And then under which conditions do you think FDA would deem that trial pivotal? Secondly, maybe for Hank again. You are now assessing the proportionality in the Phase 3 trial for vosoritide but how important is that end point in the regulatory's eyes when you apply for approval pending the positive Phase 3 trial? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. How important is I guess... Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. (57:38) and the risk and the regulatory landscape (57:41). Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So I mentioned that we've had completed one round of interactions between EMA and the FDA. So hopefully that answers have we met with the FDA. And as to the path between now and the initiation of the Phase 2b study or the next study, and further FDA interactions, I probably won't give more specific comments about that until we're closer to the initiation of the clinical trial. Your question about what would be the basis for approval? I think it was, of the next trial that we do and as I laid out, that could be – if that trial is a factoring endpoint, it could lead to an accelerated approval in the U.S., conditional marketing authorization in Europe. If that end point ends up being bleeding rate, that could lead to a full approval in both territories and exactly what mix and what approach we take, we're still in the process of harmonizing the feedback that we've obtained from the different regions. So a fairly normal phase or the process of pivoting from proof-of-concept into registration-enabling trials where we want to get the heaven of the best possible data to support adoption and reimbursement and the fastest regulatory action, so we can get started selling the product to patients. Now, switching the gears and talking about proportionality. The importance of proportionality, I think, is that it's something that defines achondroplasia different than growth hormone deficiency and represents an additional source of morbidity. It is less clearly understood than growth velocity as an outcome variable in statural disorders than proportionality is, but it could be relevant to substantiate that there is benefit for treatment beyond just growing faster. It could be that improving growth improves proportionality, improving growth and proportionality improves functional outcomes. And therefore that could be part of the story of how vosoritide gets approved at the end of the day. Now we're still collecting and doing trials and collecting data, so it's premature to speculate on what the outcomes of those trials will be, what significant regulatory review of those trial results is going to be taken for all of that. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Martin Auster from UBS. Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a follow-up on the BMN 270 manufacturing discussion that was laid out a little bit earlier. You spoke of a roughly nine-month timeframe between product production in Q3 of 2017 until Q2 2018 when the product from the new manufacturing facility could be introduced into the study. I just wanted to confirm that you intend to use the commercial produced product into the registration study? And also kind of, if you can comment on kind of your confidence level around that roughly nine-month timeframe and any key gating steps in that process? Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. I'll start and then again, Hank and Robert can provide their perspective. It says on the big picture plan here when we said we anticipate starting the single trial (01:01:59) in Q3 at the time. And of course based on the timelines for the new facility, when we start that trial, we cannot use material from the new facility yet. So the plan in that case is to use material from a supplier that's used for the same process as the one we intend to use in the new facility but at a different scale, and it would be a larger scale in the new facility. Now, our intent is that to start sourcing, the product can be used in the field trial in the spring of next year from the new facility, and at the same time, anticipate to show comparability between the material provided from the current supplier and the new facility material. Should we be unable to show comparability between the two materials, then our current plan would be just to extend the field trials so as to enroll a sufficient number of patients from the new facility to still get approval with just patients treated from the new facility which will be the commercial scale and commercial process. Let's get out the big picture. Hank, do you want to add anything to that for Robert? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, so one thing I would add – that's exactly the right description. You can think about what factors would cause an agency to be concerned about scale up and what factors would cause them to be unconcerned. So the better our comparability data, the less concerned they'll be and more willing they might be to accept the pooling of data from the two different sources. And then another aspect of consideration will be what's the relative benefit? And I think you can tell from the fact that we've received prime designation from the EMA, that there's a clearly clear recognition that the potential benefit of gene therapy is huge. So I think our view is, is that that's a reason to believe that we might be able to pool the results from studies of teams of the smaller scale same process with larger scale same process, but as J.J. laid out, stay tuned for how that action turns out. Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Afternoon guys. Thanks for the question. You had another one on BMN 270. So Hank, I know you've had some preliminary regulatory discussions but I was just curious if you had any thoughts on there being any major differences and how the U.S. versus EU versus Japan, for example, the attitudes on risk benefit for BMN 270 and maybe some of the goal post that they would look for on the safety side, are there subtle differences that you'd expect or can you use the single trial across the globe to support approval? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, I think you just put your finger on the pulse of it. In the rare disease space, I think (1:04:38) has recognized the challenge of having region-specific trials. And part of the prime process is for them to be able to touch all the different corners of their process as early in the process as possible to facilitate that harmonization between the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration. Japan, we don't have as much experience with gene therapy just yet. So, my comments will be confined with the EMA and the FDA. My expectation is that the differences will be more subtle than they are major, but having this in the details and again you have to stay tuned to see how we're going to harmonize those various details. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Raju Prasad from William Blair. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Thanks for taking the question. Hank, we've spoken to the few KOLs that showed a little bit concern on factor levels above 125%. Is that something that came up in regulatory discussions that you've had? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I think the important thing to remember is just that we have a trial that allowed us to treat patients with that 5 x 1013 vg/kg dose that produced for one patient who's factor levels were above the upper limit normal. I'm not sure I know where the famous 125% or 120% (01:06:11). I mean that value is in the normal range. So I'm not sure where that concern emanated from. What we've said is that one out of our seven high-dose patients had stabilized around 250% and the remainder are below that upper limit of normal. So we've talked about what the ethno-immunologic evidence for how to evaluate the consequence that are and have characterized that as being fairly negligible. Having said that, we don't expect that every KOL is going to have the same opinion of the data on being number one and that it will take more and sample size longer-term follow-up to accumulate more data that will ultimately bring all prescribers into – or as many as possible into the viewfinder for prescribers as – prescribers of gene therapy. So we're pretty comfortable with the outcome of program so far from a health authority perspective. Stay tuned for more details about the program. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. And then... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And this is in the context, if I may add, of where we stand now is – or the patients that have been treated with a high dose where we indeed had one patient that was above 150% which is upper limit (01:07:42). That's why we real puzzled by this 125% because as Hank said it is still within normal range, so we know where it comes from. Just in the context of patients that have not had any (01:07:54) or any need for recombinant Factor VIII infusion since July of last year. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. And then just a quick one, the manufacturing facility. Can you give some more color on the capacity days we have as far as – will you guys be able to produce other vectors aside from the ones you used for BMN 270? I just asked this because I think J.J. you've mentioned potentially disclosing another gene therapy candidate this year. Is that still the plan? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. As to next IND candidates, we tend not to talk about them until we talk about them and we haven't talk about them. We said, we recognized, we have a leadership position in gene therapy that might predispose us. And at the same time, there are other potentially very large orphans that could be of interest to BioMarin. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So, we – seen another way, our gene therapies would probably be an important component of our future. At this time we don't really have any intention to turn into a pure gene therapy company. And we have internal research efforts and also business development efforts that also could potentially and likely will identify non-generic gene therapy solution to some rare and ultra-rare disorders that have no available therapy today. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. Thanks for the question. Operator And our next question comes from Jing He from Gabelli. Jing He - G.research LLC Thanks of taking the question. So on BMN 270, would you expect to have enough data from 4 x 1013 before starting Phase 2b. Should we expect an update on Q3? And also on Brineura, it's early days but just wondering if you've got any feedback from payers, especially on pricing. Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I'm just wondering, are we going to have some data I think that's what I heard on the 4 x 1013 addition before making a decision on the final design of the pivotal trial? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Of course. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes, we will and we have an ongoing study of 4 x 1013. We have dosed 70 patients at 6 x 1013. As to whether that's sufficient or we need more dose finding, TBD. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And on your second question, the launch of Brineura just got under way, essentially this week. We've announced the price. We have some patients that are commercially in motion. We don't have any response yet from payers. Jing He - G.research LLC Great. Thanks. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for question. I will now turn the call back over to CEO and Chairman, J.J. Bienaimé for closing remarks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, operator. So in summary, we start 2017 from a position of strength. We've been delivering a record quarter of $304 million in total BioMarin revenues. We've seen a 28% growth year-over-year. We got out sixth product approved, Brineura by the U.S. FDA. And it's in the process of being introduced probably at the beginning of June and potentially soon thereafter in Europe. Of course, upon a anticipated positive opinion there in June. Regarding our gene therapy program, it's moving forward and towards a registration-enabling study. Our pegvaliase is on the horizon and on track for a late Q2 filing. And continuing enrollments of our vosoritide and BMN 250 programs is (01:11:49). And so we look forward to continued success out of our worldwide development organizations. And we thank you for your continuous support and for joining us on today's call.

On today’s call, I will update you on the results of our business in the second quarter and Efrain will review our financial results in more detail and discuss our full-year guidance. After that, we’ll open it up for your questions. Our results for the second quarter reflected good progress. We continue to see positive results across our major product lines and service revenue for the second quarter grew by 7% year-over-year. We achieved a new milestone this quarter as we obtained 1 million client worksite employees, served by our Paychex HR Services. Paychex HR Services is our comprehensive outsourcing services product line and that includes our ASO or Administrative Services Organization and our PEO, our Professional Employer Organization as well. Our cloud-based HCM services, in particular, time and attendance continue to show strong growth in the quarter. Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of the acquisition of Advance Partners. Advance has been an excellent addition to the Paychex family. We’re very pleased with the leadership and the team’s contribution to our financial results and the future opportunities for growth we see in that business particularly timely as the staffing business is picking up some expanded growth today. With the success of our of HCM solutions, we have continued to invest in operations personnel as we’ve expanded our multiproduct service centers, including our time and attendance support and our ACA product compliance and service teams. Client retention remains at consistent high levels. We have also invested in our service – in our sales organization over the last year adding headcount across all sales teams and we are well-positioned going into our third quarter. We will have a better idea of overall sales performance and the impact of the fiscal year next quarter after the end of our peak sales season. We continue to make it a priority to provide robust HCM solutions that may be – the evolving needs of our client base. At the recent HR Technology Conference and Exposition in October, we showcased enhancements to Paychex Flex that addressed two of the biggest trends in the HR industry; mobile user experience and HR analytics. Attendees at the conference were able to view a demo of Paychex Flex, which included these enhancements. We also announced that we shifted to a mobile-first design of our HCM suite. This approach allows Paychex Flex users to have full functionality of all application components regardless of device or screen size. The growing trend for both HR leaders and employees is the use of a mobile device. Shifting to a mobile-first design demonstrates our commitment to putting the needs of our clients and their employees first, so that they can accomplish their HR test, where they want, when they want, and on whatever device they want. We continue to receive positive recognition of our Flex platform in November. We were honored to be recognized as a leader in the 2016 NelsonHall Payroll Outsourcing NEAT, a component of the firm’s speed-to-source initiative. NEAT stands for NelsonHall’s evaluation and assessment tool and is a vendor evaluation report tool that can be utilized by managers to evaluate outsourcing vendors. This was the first time we had participated in this initiative and we were placed in the leader quadrant for three areas; technology and user experience, analytics and reporting, and HR cloud integration. The client feedback that goes into this ranking makes a center even more important to us and reinforces our commitment to delivering the best and most robust solutions in the market today with our Paychex Flex platform. This has been a transition period in the U.S. with the presidential election and the move to the Trump administration. We have been asked a few times how we anticipate the new administration will impact the economy overall and more specifically the payroll and human capital management outsourcing industry? In this transition time, many business owners could be hesitant to make longer-term decisions. We see this as being more likely to impact the mid to large-sized businesses rather than small businesses. President-elect Trump is indicated that he intends to lower taxes and create less regulation. This would be a positive for small businesses. It would lower the cost and allow them to invest and higher more. Paychex would benefit as our clients expand and add employees and potentially see value in our HCM services. While complex regulations tend to drive companies to an outsourcing solution, we believe any change in regulation is good for Paychex. We remained informed about what is happening in the regulatory environment and are well-positioned to continue to educate our clients and assist them with their compliance needs through our technology and service support. Over the last year, the Affordable Care Act has been a tailwind for payroll outsourcing companies, including ourselves. Any rollback of Obamacare or Affordable Care Act or a reduction in compliance and administration requirements will impact the HCM outsourcing industry. Given our target market of small to medium-sized businesses, a large portion of our client base is not – has not been impacted by ACA. In November, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction to temporarily block the Department of Labor’s final overtime rule that would have become effect of December 1. This rule would expand overtime for millions of workers. As a result of this injunction, employers did not have to be in compliance with the new rules as of December 1. The ruling is temporary, but creates substantial uncertainty for businesses. The proposed rules created an enhanced awareness for the need for time and attendance solutions, particularly to those integrated within their – with the clients HCM product suite. This brought an increased demand for our products that we don’t see diminishing with the delay in the rules. We will continue to monitor the status of these regulations and ensure our clients remain informed as to how any changes may affect them. Shifting the discussion from clients to shareholders, we continued with shareholder-friendly actions. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares for a total of $166 million, and we will continue to maintain an industry leading dividend yield of over 3% with a quarterly dividend up $0.46 per share. In summary, we have made solid progress in growth in our financial performance during the past quarter, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex’s employees and management team. And I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera Good morning. I’d like to remind everyone that today’s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve risks, refer to the customary disclosures. As Marty indicated, second quarter financial results fiscal 2017 showed continued progress and growth. I’ll cover some of the key highlights for the second quarter and the six months, provide greater detail in certain areas, and warp with a review of the 2017 outlook. Total service revenue grew 7% for the second quarter to $760 million, and 8% for the six months to $1.5 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the second quarter and 6% for the six months to a $11 million and $23 million, respectively. These changes were primarily driven by slightly higher average interest rates earned. The growth was tempered by a slight decrease in the average investment balances by approximately 1% for both periods. This is really a timing issue that we call out in the press release. Expenses increased to 8% for both the second quarter and six months, with Advance Partners contributing approximately 1.5% to this growth for both periods. Expense growth was impacted by higher wages and related expenses due to growth in headcount in our operations area. Selling expenses have shown modest growth, reflecting strong sales performance in the year-ago quarter. Our operating margin was approximately 40.3% for the second quarter and 40.7% year-to-date comparable with the prior-year periods. We continue to maintain industry-leading margins, while investing in our operations. Our effective income tax rate was 35.2% for the second quarter and 34.1% for the six months, compared to 36% and 32.9% for the respective periods last year. As we discussed on our last quarterly call, we had several discrete items – tax items in the first quarter both years that have impacted the year-to-date effective income tax rates. In fiscal 2017, we implemented new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation, which has resulted in discrete tax benefits now being recognized upon exercise or lapse of stock-based awards. The impact of this in the second quarter was immaterial, but had a larger impact in the first quarter. Last year in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer-facing software we produced, because there have been ins and outs refer to the press release and you’ll see we provide a non-GAAP EBITDA comparison, I should say, non-GAAP EPS comparison with and without these items. Net income increased 7% to $202 million for the second quarter and 5% to $420 million for the six months. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 5% to $1.16 per share for the six months. On a non-GAAP basis, as I mentioned, just a second ago, adjusted net income increased 6% to $201 million for the second quarter and 7% to $405 million for the six months. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 8% to $1.12 per share for the six months. Note that these two non-GAAP measures, exclude certain discrete tax items previously discussed, refer to the tables if you have any questions about that. Payroll service revenue increased 3% for the second quarter to $441 million and 4% to $892 million for the six months. Advance Partners contributed 1% to the growth in payroll service revenue for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check, revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. Payroll client size impacted revenue, as average client size trended modestly lower. We discussed that in the first quarter. We saw a continuation of that trend in the second quarter. While we continue to present payroll service revenue and HRS revenue, I want to emphasize one important point. With the evolving nature of our businesses to an HCM provider, we now offer more product bundles that are bundled with payroll revenue from these bundles as allocated among payroll and HRS. The payroll growth remained steady, but HRS growth reflects the sale of more services to clients in greater revenue per client. And I call out specifically that we have another strong quarter in time and attendance sales. HRS revenue increased 12% to $319 million for the second quarter, 14% to $642 million for the six months. This increase reflects continued growth across our client base and all HCM services, including our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance, and HR administration. Within Paychex HR Services, we continue to see strong demand, which is reflected in the double-digit year-over-year growth in the number of client worksite employees served. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our SR services, as well as growth in the number of health and benefit applicants. Our workers comp insurance product benefited from higher average premiums and client base growth. Retirement services revenue reflected an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds, as well as an increase in the number of plans served. Last, Advance Partners contributed a little bit less than 2% to the growth in HRS revenue for both the second quarter and the six months. Investments in income. Turning to our portfolio, our goal is, as you know, to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term vehicles remain bank demand deposit accounts and variable rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, some corporate bonds and U.S. government securities long-term portfolio has now as an average yield of 1.7%, and an average duration of 3.3 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.2% for the second quarter and six months, up from 1.1% last year. Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased by approximately 1% year-over-year. As the impact from growth in client base was offset by timing of certain remittances to taxing authorities, we expect that in the second-half of the year that will change and we’ll – we expect client base, client growth – clients funds growth, I should say, sorry, to grow about 1%. I’ll now walk you through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $725 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients as of November 30 were $3.2 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients very widely, as you know, and they average $3.7 billion for both the quarter and the six months. Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments in funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $16 million as of November 30, compared with a net unrealized gain of $48 million as of May 31. Recently interest rates for intermediate term investors, investments, I should say, have rallied resulting in a decrease in the market value of our portfolio. Total stockholders’ equity was $1.8 billion as of November 30, 2016, reflecting $331 million in dividends and $166 million of repurchases of Paychex common stock, a return on equity for the past 12 months was 40%. Cash flows from operations were $413 million for the first six months, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. This decrease was a result of fluctuations in working capital offset by higher net income and non-cash adjustments. Now, let me turn to guidance. We remind you that the outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions. And what I mean by that is, we do factor in the recent Fed rate raise, but we don’t factor in any continuing raises beyond that. We’ll update as we see those. We obviously expect that there will be some, but they’re not baked into this guidance. Payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%. We anticipate payroll revenue growth in the third quarter will be below the range of full-year guidance as we discussed on last quarter’s call. We now expect that it will be approximately 2%. Remember that the third quarter is impacted by one less processing day. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain in the range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is anticipated to remain in the range of 7% to 8%. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow in the upper single digits. The impact of the recent increase in short-term rates will be modest, but we be more accretive as we enter into 2018. Operating margins are anticipated to be consistent with the guidance previously provided. The effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35%. GAAP basis net income growth is expected to be approximately 7%. We said that last quarter, adjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP measure that exclude certain discrete tax items is anticipated to grow approximately 8% consistent with the guidance that we gave in June. I turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci Thank you, Efrain. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Yes, sir. We will now have the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first one is from Mr. Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Sir, your line is open. Jason Kupferberg Thanks. Good morning, guys. happy holidays to you. Martin Mucci Same to you. Jason Kupferberg Thanks. I just want to start with a question on the Core Payroll segment, just trying to do the math in the back of the more precise outlook on Q3 at the 2% level. I mean, I guess, to get to the midpoint of the full-year 3% to 4% range, it seems lick you’d have to be about 4.5% growth in Q4. So just so we’ve got our models aligned properly, I mean, should we be thinking about the lower-end 3% to 4% [more effectively,] [ph] or are there some real accelerators in Q4, I know you’re not going to have the benefit of Advance anymore, but I don’t think you’re disadvantaged in terms of processing days either there? Efrain Rivera Yes, Jason, I think to call it precisely, it’s a little bit tough, because we need to get through selling. But I think at this point, we’d anticipate we’re towards the lower-end of that range. Jason Kupferberg Okay, all right, understood. And then just wanted to check on pricing as well, that’s an area to continue to always get questions on. I know you talked about there being some lift from pricing. If it is still in that historical 2% to 4% range, I guess, that would imply that on an organic basis that volumes in core payroll were kind of flat to down, are we thinking about that right? Is 2% to 4% still the right range that you’re seeing on price? Efrain Rivera Yes. So let me talk about that. So, yes, it is 2% to 4%. This year, it’s probably closer to the lower-end. We’ve been trending somewhere between the low and the mid part of that range. So we still are getting price. We still are getting volume. So our client base is up over last year. And we’ve said, we would be between 1% to 3%, last year we were 2%, we’re in that range. So what accounts for the difference, it is accounted for by the fact that our client – average client size is a little bit smaller, so to put this in context. If you go back 10 years, go back to 2007, our average client size is 17. But some years, it’s 17.1. Last year we ended at 16.73. And at this point, we are trending slightly down from that number. And so that the effect of that mix is basically taking payroll service revenues down. This happens from time to time. It happens more when two things are present. The first is that, we start to see a flattening in checks for payroll, which is what we’ve been seeing over the last three to four quarters. Actually this quarter, our checks for payroll went negative. So what that means is that and by the way that’s on a same-store basis, I want to clarify that. What that means is that, particularly, our clients in the under 50 space simply aren’t adding a lot of employees at this stage. Will that continue? We’ll see. It’s been bouncing around quarter-to-quarter, and if you look at our index that we publish each month, you’ll see that reflected in the numbers. But that’s part A. And then part B is that, as we sell clients that are a little bit lower than those that we lose, we have this drag effect. In most years that basically is offset by some client checks for payroll growth. This is a year where we’re not seeing that. So we’re monitoring that and saw some of it in Q1 and we’ll see if it continues into Q2 It can bounce around, I would just caution not to assume that that’s exactly what you’re going to see through the balance of the year. But we’re assuming at this point some drag in checks for payroll as we go through the year. Martin Mucci We’re not – just to add to that a little bit. We’re not – when you look at last year’s second quarter, there was kind of a push because of the Affordable Care Act, particularly in the mid-market clients. And to get in and buy those services and therefore it got you in the door a lot more sales, and that kind of ticked up the size of the average client, because we sold a little bit more in the mid-market. So it’s an interesting time with the election to see how much the Affordable Care Act last year versus this year had an impact. And because we sold those clients pretty much who needed it. Now, the retention has been very strong on that product even with the uncertainty. But that was higher last year. It got you in the door a lot more in the mid-market, because they were interested in not only the Affordable Care Act, but how you integrated with the payroll services. And so that may have been an impact. And then as Efrain mentioned on our small business index, we’ve seen a flattening out of hiring in the small business sector, the under 50 employees sector, and for a couple of months now, and that could be around the election or not. So it’s kind of an interesting quarter because of the election and the possible changes coming up as well. Jason Kupferberg Okay, that’s helpful. Just one last one for me. I think in the quarter, you bought back more than twice as many shares as you had bought all of last fiscal year. So wanted to get a sense of whether that’s indicative of any change in the M&A pipeline in terms of the prospects there, either in terms of size of the prospects or potential timing on the prospects? Efrain Rivera Yes. So the short answer is no. The share repurchase itself was really simply an attempt to get back down to average share count. And if you look at it, we actually were still a little bit high compared to where we were last year. So we’ll do a little bit of – on an year-to-date basis, we’ll do a little bit more buying just to get back to flat. Now actually, Marty can talk a little bit more about the M&A pipeline, but it’s pretty robust. Martin Mucci Yes, still pretty active, not always finding exactly what we want, but it’s – I don’t think it’s ever been probably more active from a pipeline standpoint. It’s just whether you get to the final deal or not based on the value and what we find in diligence, but been very active on that front and it hasn’t slowed down at all. Jason Kupferberg Okay. Thanks, again, guys. Martin Mucci All right. Thanks, Jason. Operator Thank you. The next question is from James Berkley with Barclays. Your line is open. James Berkley Hi, guys. Hi, guys, thanks a lot for taking my questions here. Just want to get a better handle on how to think about new revenue growth for 2017. I know you touched on a little bit on the payroll side just now. But through the first-half of the year, you’re near the high-end of your guided ranges on payroll and HRS growth. But this quarter did see the low-end of those ranges, you’ve got Advance Partners lapping one less day in fiscal third quarter questions around the Affordable Care Act and time and attendance, given the delay with the Department of Labor. How do we think about all those moving parts in the back-half of the year, in particular, and what do you think about the ACA and time and attendance, the aspect – that aspect post-Trump versus previously? Efrain Rivera Okay, wow, that’s a compound question. So, I’d say, let me just say broadly and then I’ll come back to ACA and other regulatory changes, Marty obviously will have some thoughts on that. But our guidance contemplates all of those issues. Obviously, we just answered a question on payroll services, revenue growth, HRS has remained unchanged. So from that standpoint, we feel comfortable with where we are for the remainder of the year and for the full-year. We don’t focus necessarily on quarters unless there’s some – something unusual in the quarter that we want to call out like Q3, which has one less day. I feel comfortable about where we are in terms of margins and expenses. So that outlook that we’re providing basically encompasses what we understand the environment to be, don’t anticipate it will change significantly. Now, with respect to ACA and with respect to other changes in regulation, it’s a little bit early to call those. The overtime rules change, at this point don’t see a lot of impact on the balance of the year. It could impact next year and then on what exactly happens with ACA, that’s a question to be answered at this point. What I would say is, if we were to see some sort of a significant movement to repeal starting sometime in late Spring, our anticipation of is that were to rollout over a, let’s say, call it a two to three-year period is that we would see about an impact of 1% on EPS per year. If it was more accelerated, it might be more, but we’re still waiting, that that by the way is more of a worse case scenario, 1% to 1.5% EPS. We think we have other options to replace that revenue. But at this point, we would frame sort of the risk if the ACA got repealed in an orderly fashion. If it got replaced and repealed immediately, that would be a different conversation, we’ll have to wait and see where we end up. Martin Mucci Yes, I think the expectation, at least, at this point would be, it’s going to take sometime, it’s pretty complicated, as you know, and to change it. So and we’re seeing very solid retention. Of course, clients are looking for us to file in March now for them, and I don’t think you’re going to see much movement, at least, through that filing period. And I think it’s going to be a longer thing, which as Efrain mentioned, we’re looking at depending on what happens a number of products. My guess is, clients are still going to have to do something and they’re going to need some support for that. So we feel pretty good that we will be able to adapt to that, might not make up all of the revenue, but it certainly has some opportunity there. From a time and attendance, it’s been interesting that we’ve had very strong sales of our time and attendance solutions. And we’ve introduced the new one that is Flex Essentials, that is a no clock, all web, or mobile punch, much simpler to set up, and we’ve seen an acceleration there. So I think the whole overtime rule issue even though it’s now been delayed and may end up never being enacted who knows has driven a lot of interest in time and attendance. And so that’s driven sales that I don’t think somebody is going to necessarily get rid of that product, and in fact, it may keep kind of a heightened demand now. So I think that’s how we feel about it is pretty good at this point and see what happens next. James Berkley That makes a lot of sense and thanks for the color on the ACA there. Those numbers are really helpful. Just one more quick follow-up here, more of a high-level question. Just correct me if I’m wrong. I believe about 10% of your company’s revenue is driven by the PEO business, another 10% from the ASO side. I think you got PEO growing more quickly over the last few years. Just curious if you could talk about how fast each is growing the trends that you’ve seen, whether there has been an acceleration recently versus past quarters or past years and just going into more detail on each of those and what’s driving the gap between the two growth rates? Efrain Rivera Yes. So what we’ve said about the HR outsourcing business is that, it’s about half of HRS revenue and within that half about half is PEO and half is ASO. So that’s what we said and we update that year. our PEO has been growing more quickly than ASO, but both have been growing double-digits. I guess, that’s what we’d say. The only other thing I would add to that is that, because of the PEO, we report healthcare attachment as part of the revenues of the PEO when we get better healthcare attachment in the quarter than you have better PEO growth that really doesn’t have much of an impact on margins. In this quarter, we did not have as significant healthcare attachments we had in the quarter before, but that bounces around every single quarter. So in Q3, we’ll see where we end up. Martin Mucci Yes, I think we feel pretty good, obviously, reaching the new, the milestone of over a million worksite employees that we’re servicing between our service – between the ASO and PEO. We feel good. We’re very well-positioned. There’s a lot of demand for the HR support. And I think PEO, while it’s been strong in certain states and we sell it across the pretty much all states, it is starting to continue – it’s continuing to pick up more demand and we feel good about the future of it. As Efrain said, the attachment of the help can swing from kind of quarter-to-quarter or even month-to-month. But and again, I think, it’s going to be interesting to see kind of what comes out of. Now, you had a quarter, where a lot of discussion about healthcare and you may have a number of clients deciding to kind of hold, wait and see what’s going to happen, but we see good growth. We’ve been doing well in both PEO and ASO, well-positioned to have both products. So if you want co-employment, you have it. If you don’t, we have the insurance agency that’s a top agency and plenty of plans to offer. So feel good about both products right now. James Berkley Thanks a lot for your color and your time, and happy holidays. Efrain Rivera Thanks. Same to you. Martin Mucci Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open. Rayna Kumar Good morning. This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. In the first quarter, you really highlighted the strength in the mid-market and that seems to have slowed down a bit in the second quarter. I guess, what’s changed there? And maybe if you can just highlight your expectations for the remainder of the year in the mid-market? Efrain Rivera Yes, I think in the second quarter, we had a very, very strong quarter a year ago and compares were tougher. We expect that – we’re expecting a good quarter in the third quarter. And I think, Marty pointed out something that’s important. Last year, there was a drive by many mid-market companies to find integrated solutions that included an ACA compliance solution. A lot of those clients have now selected their solution and the game now is a bit more of competitive takeaway as opposed to selling them on a new solution. There obviously was some of that going on. So we go into third quarter then assuming that we’ll pick up from where we were in Q2. Martin Mucci Yes, certainly feel great about the product and ever expanding functionality of the product. And I think, as Efrain said, last year was kind of a heightened second quarter with the Affordable Care Act sales, and this year, it’s almost a little bit of the reverse. I think people are being a little careful to make any changes until they see what the rules come out, how it changes, and they’re probably concerned about their filing and making a change and not getting everything filed. So we saw a little bit probably unexpected a little bit slower there, and we expect though once we get past the filing date. So expect a good selling season here, but it may still continue to be a little bit slow through the third quarter until we get past the filing date. We’ll have to see kind of how that shakes out. But we feel certainly good about the product, the competitiveness and going head-to-head with any of the competitors in the market. Rayna Kumar I guess, besides client behavior, are you seeing any change in the competitive landscape at all? Martin Mucci No, not really. No, there’s no real new competitors there. We haven’t seen a lot of change in their approach or product. And I think we’ve, as I mentioned, we’ve continued to add new options to our product and more self-service, more analytics that we’ve talked about HR analytics and providing more there mobile-first design, so an increased use of mobile. So we’re feeling very good, very competitive. We have not really seen any change from a competitive marketplace. Rayna Kumar Great. Thank you. That’s very helpful, happy holidays. Martin Mucci Thank you. Same to you. Efrain Rivera Same to you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open. Martin Mucci Hi, Jim. Jim Schneider Good morning. Thanks. Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. As many – as I’m sure, you saw the FIB put up some small business confidence indicators for the month of November, which were essentially stronger after the election than before. I guess, it sounds like from your overall kind of qualitative client commentary that people are still cautious pending any changes in the regulation. Can you give us any kind of additional color on what you’ve been hearing from clients over the last month or month-and-a-half in terms of their optimism on overall business levels and how that kind of matches with your commentary on the rest of the business? Efrain Rivera Yes, I think it’s exactly, I think it’s optimism, pending action. So I think it’s a lot of optimism on lower corporate tax rates could drive a lot of less expense and more to what they could invest and more employees and so forth. Affordable Care Act looks like those costs could come down for a lot of companies and not forcing them to have the product, but we’ll see. Time and attendance rules, although, it’s a little bit separate, but less regulation, I think overall it’s a very optimistic attitude from the clients, but not necessarily turning that into action yet, because they got to see it. So they’re feeling good about the fact that it looks like there’s going to be a better business environment, consumer confidence is also up and FIB was one of the biggest increases we’ve seen in over the 42-year average for one of the three times, I think, in the last to almost 10 years. So there’s a lot of optimism. But I don’t think, again, they’re turning that into action hiring and so forth, at least, yet until they see kind of what the first few months of the new administration brings. That’s what we’re kind of getting great optimism, but the small business index, at least, for November our last one would show still not a big uptick in hiring kind of at the same growth rate it was last year for, at least, small business. So very positive, but kind of waiting to see what happens. Jim Schneider That’s helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, I think last quarter you cited the traction you’re seeing in the 100 to 200 plus kind of segment and the new incremental sales spend you’ve been putting against that. Can you talk about first of all whether there’s any change or in that traction whether you’re seeing continued momentum there? And whether you think the incremental sales spend you put against that is actually adequate at this point, such that, you don’t have to increase it more in the coming quarters? Martin Mucci Yes, I don’t think, I think we’re adequate. We’re fully staffed and feel very good about being fully staffed and out there. I think the only surprise in the quarter we’ve kind of already mentioned, which is a little bit more in activity to make a change than we saw last year at this time. And I think that would be the only difference, and I think that’s kind of more of a macro kind of issue. And so I think that would be the only change. Certainly feel good about, as I mentioned, the competitiveness. No change really in the competitive environment, and we’re fully staffed and gaining more and more experience on the newer reps that we added at the beginning of the fiscal year. So we’ll be able to talk more about it after the selling season. The only real difference from first quarter, I would say is, with the election, which really change quite rapidly, at least, the view of the election and who won, I think that just put people in a little bit more cautious period for switching anything or making buying decisions in the second quarter. Jim Schneider That’s fair. And just a quick clarification, if I could. In the quarter itself relative to the plan you had heading into the quarter, would you say that the DOL lack of bookings or the ACA shortfall was kind of the bigger contributor there? Martin Mucci Well, I don’t – I think the ACA, I think just the election, if I’m getting your question right, Jim, I think the question or the what happened was with the changes in ACA, with the President, with Trump getting in and probably a little bit more unexpected until second quarter as it got closer to the election, I think people know changes are going to happen. And so they’re a little bit less, they’re a little bit more reluctant to make a change until they see kind of what happens. They’re optimistic, but they’re not sure what’s going to happen yet. And so if that answers your question of the deal. If you’re talking about the overtime rules, I think that was very helpful from an over – from a selling of our Flex Time and Flex Essentials and our Time clocks, and I think that’s sticking. So the good thing there is, it brought a lot of attention to, you’re to be tracking time, look at the options that are out there now from a technology standpoint, punching in and out on a mobile phone, things that have not been available generally until the last year or so. And I think that’s going to stick, so that actually helped drive some sales that are recorded in our HRS services revenue. And I think that’s going to continue and it’s going to stick no matter what happens with overtime rules. Jim Schneider Great. Thank you. Martin Mucci Okay. Efrain Rivera You’re welcome. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Gary Bisbee Hey, guys, good morning. Martin Mucci Good morning, Gary. Gary Bisbee There’s quite a bit of demand about, how much you’ll actually benefit in the short-term float? So I wanted to ask a two-part question to help frame that. The first one, as you think about the float, how you manage the float, is it still right, I know there’s some seasonality, but to think that roughly half of the float balance is short-term stuff, whether it’s money-markets, the variable demand rate notes et cetera, and you target about half in intermediate term bonds? And the second question, if we look at that bond portfolio, I think, you said 3.3-year duration… Efrain Rivera Yep. Gary Bisbee Is the stuff that’s maturing in the next 12 months, are the interest rates that you would likely reinvest that in today above the rates of the stuff that’s maturing, or is that still a negative at this point? Thank you. Efrain Rivera Okay. Hey, good question. So, yes, you’re right. It’s – short-term is about 45%, can be sometimes 50, but we keep it between 45 and 50. So that reprices immediately or very quickly, I shouldn’t say – should say. Let me just be careful, that’s an overstatement. It doesn’t reprice immediately. It typically reprices somewhere between 45 to 60 days. So the answer to the first question portfolio composition is yes. That’s correct. And then the second is yes, also. Yes, the bonds that we would invest in going forward currently have yields that are significantly higher than the ones that are rolling off. So if I were to call it today and I’m not doing that, but if I were to call it today, and I assume no more Fed increases other than what we have gotten to this point, the portfolio would be about $8 million higher in value than it is today. I just caution anyone from taking that to the bank, because we’ll have much more granular information once we get through the next couple of quarters and see what the Fed actually does. And the reason why I say that is, we look at and we could give you a big forecast based on yield curves. I distrust that approach. I’d rather tell you what we think our portfolios will do based on what I know at the time I’m saying it, but you can do some math. And the numbers start to get pretty significant, if the Fed does what it says it’s going to do and the final qualification, I’d add to that is the steepness of the yield curve also impacts how we invest. So right now, they do nothing. I’d call it at about $8 million next year, that’s annualized, and we’ll see where we go through the remainder of the year. Gary Bisbee And just to clarify that that’s very helpful by the way. So the $8 million, that is annualizing and getting the full benefit from the Fed funds rate increase recently and also the benefit from reinvesting bonds at what the current yield curve is, is that correct? Efrain Rivera Yes, correct. Gary Bisbee Okay. And then just one other question. The – and maybe this is just getting too nitpicking on my end, but the buyback was pretty significant no increase in the guidance for earnings, it feels like there’s a couple of pennies there, is that just conservatism or is there some other thing we should think about with that? Thank you. Efrain Rivera Yes, I guess, I’d say this, Gary. There’s always pluses and minuses, so you have to look at what you think are potential upsides but potential downsides. And I think it’s realistic, I wouldn’t call it aggressive and I wouldn’t call it conservative. Gary Bisbee Okay. And then just actually one other one. Have you done the analysis and maybe it’s just, we don’t know enough, but about what kind of risk you might face in terms of potential declines in the float portfolio balance is based on some of the personnel income tax changes that Trump and the Republican Congress have been floating? Should we think of that as a potential offset to some of this is the withholding might be less for a significant portion your customers? Thank you. Efrain Rivera Yes. We haven’t started doing modeling at this point, because at that point the benefit, okay. So that’s coupled with a more bigger a discussion about whether corporate tax rates go down. If that happens then even if we face some drag from personnel income taxes. The corporate tax impact simply dwarfs everything else. So that that we’d look at both. So if tax reform occurs, it’s pretty obvious that we would be a pretty significant beneficiary by significant, I mean, very significant. So we’re waiting to hear like everyone else is waiting to hear. So that’s a partial answer to your question. Gary Bisbee Yes, great, that’s helpful. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Happy Holidays. Efrain Rivera Thanks, Gary. Martin Mucci Thanks, Gary. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. Bryan Keane Hi, guys. Just wanted – a couple clarifications just on HR Services. I think the street was looking for more like 14% revenue growth. I know the guide is 12% to 14% and it came in a little bit towards the lower-end, was there just want to make sure the puts and takes there is what I’m thinking about obviously as Advance Partners acquisition is anniversarying and that contributed two points to growth. So then I’m thinking about the back-half of the year with that coming off, do we have enough in the pipe and in sales to actually increase that growth rate for the back-half? Efrain Rivera Yes, so Bryan, our guidance obviously included Advance. We came out of the first quarter, I think, we’re at 15% growth. I think I called out attach rates on healthcare in the PEO were a little bit lower than we had projected. That can reverse very, very quickly quarter-to-quarter, so we’ll see where we are in Q3. But in terms of where we expect the year to be, we are not really far off from what we expected. So I see where people might get to 14%. I don’t think our internal plans suggest we be at 14%. And so we should be solidly in the year in the range of the guidance that we provided. And obviously, as you pointed out, the selling season will have an impact on where HRS growth ends up for the year, but we feel comfortable with the range as we’ve given. Bryan Keane Okay. And then in the back-half since Advance will be now in the numbers that won’t probably push that growth rate, should we think about more towards the lower-end then in that range of 12% to 14% for the back-half as a result of Advance anniversary? Efrain Rivera I would say, yes, subject to whatever we see in terms of sales in Q – I’m sorry, in the third quarter, which is where the bulk of the selling season comes in. I would say that, although, I didn’t call out where we end up in Q4, our guidance is for the year as a whole and we feel comfortable for the year as a whole that may not be that or that may be that some quarters aren’t exactly in the range of the guidance. So if it’s significant, we’ll call it out. Bryan Keane Okay, helpful. And then just time and attendance, how big is that and how fast has that been growing? I know it’s been a – one of the catalyst that you guys have called out just how big is that as a percentage of revenue and maybe the growth rates you guys have been seeing there? Efrain Rivera So last time we updated it, it’s about – it was about last year about 10%, I should say, online services, which includes HR Administration, which is also part of the equation back up a second. So it’s clear the fundamental parts of the HCM platform include an HR Administration module with time and attendance module and obviously a payroll engine module. So about 10% of HRS revenue growth – revenue is online services. We don’t break it out more than that. That’s been growing at multiples with what payroll has been growing at. Bryan Keane Okay. Thanks so much and happy holidays, guys. Efrain Rivera Thanks, Bryan. Martin Mucci Thanks, Bryan. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Sir, your line is open. Kartik Mehta Hey, good morning, Marty. Good morning, Efrain. Yes, Efrain, I just want to make sure I understood something you said about the float portfolio. I think you said, obviously, if the rates kin of – the Fed did nothing, it would be about $8 million. I seem to remember, I thought in the queue you said a 25 basis points would mean after-tax net income of $3.5 million to $4 million. Efrain Rivera Yes. Kartik Mehta And so that $8 million, is there some tax impact to that, that would be different, or did I – am I missing something that you might have said or misinterpreting? Efrain Rivera No, no, you’re just missing some information, so which I didn’t provide in my estimate. So our disclosure is that a 25 basis point rise impacts the portfolio immediately on an annualized basis to the tune of about $3.5 million, $3.7 million, I believe it is. But that doesn’t end the conversation, because then the question you have to ask yourself is, what does it do to long-term rates? If in the end, your reinvestment for long-term rates stays the same, it’s done nothing. You’ve gotten a benefit on the short-term portion of the portfolio, but very little else. The benefit we’re getting right now and I – the reason why I caution about including any interest rate benefit in models yet is that the securities that we invest in intermediate term municipals have gone up pretty significantly since the election, so our reinvestment rate is higher than it is right now. So if all we got was a 3.5 basis point, I’m sorry, a 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate. You could expect that we would get roughly what we say we would get. But we’re also getting a bit of a benefit on the long-term portion of the portfolio. And what I don’t know now and I’ll have a better sense is that, the Fed keeps raising interest rates. What’s happening to the shape of that yield curve as I go out over the maturities that we have to reinvest. So right now, if everything held, I’d be about – on an annualized basis about $8 million higher. What it will end up being, I don’t know until I get to the spring and I can digest the other Fed rate increases. Kartik Mehta Okay. That makes sense. So, I guess, Efrain, will you invest a little bit differently considering the Fed might do a couple of more rate increases, so will the philosophy change at all, or will you still continue to manage the portfolio like you have? Efrain Rivera That is a discussion that we’re going to have as we get into the spring, because if the shape of the yield curve is steep around the long end, then maybe I have a less short-term cash, and I have more long. I haven’t made that decision and we haven’t had that discussion yet. We’ve had some preliminary conversations about how we would do that, but obviously that would be one way to get higher yield even than what I’m talking about on the portfolio, those are decisions that we need to look at when we get into the spring. Obviously, competitors leverage 100%. We’d never – we’ve chosen not to do that. But between where we are and where other people in the market are, there is room to move if we chose to do so. Kartik Mehta And, Marty, as you’re going into the selling season, how many payroll salespeople do you have compared to last year, is it same, less or more than you’ve had last year at this time? Efrain Rivera Yes, up 2% or 3% from a headcount perspective and fully staffed. And I think just getting those reps up to speed, but we’re up about 2% or 3%, which is fairly normal for us and it’s kind of across both small and mid-market. Kartik Mehta And where do you stand in terms of salespeople attrition today compared to what it has been in the past? Efrain Rivera Yes, a very consistent, as some are better than others. Actually some of the mid-market, I think, tends to be a little bit better than it has been historically even, and core payroll tend to be very consistent with or it’s been, no big uptick in turnover anything. Kartik Mehta And just one last question, Marty, you moved over to Flex, obviously, the transition seems to be going well. Have you seen an impact on cross sales because of customers moving to Flex either more or less in terms of product sales? Martin Mucci Yes. Well, obviously, from a Flex standpoint, you’ve got a better integration there and we’ve built everything to integrate into that and then continue to roll things out with Flex, so we’re certainly seeing better pick up from a penetration. I wouldn’t say it’s huge, but it certainly is a bigger pick up in penetration when you’re selling the Flex platform, because everything is built around that, so and we still have a lot of room to grow there. So when you think of the HR analytics that we just rolled out kind of at HR Tech and some of the other products like just rolling out Flex Essentials, which is that kind of lower-end time and attendance solution without clocks, all of that is around Flex. So we expect to have better penetration growth because of the Flex platform and the more we roll it out to clients. Kartik Mehta Okay. Hey, thank you very much Efrain and Marty. Martin Mucci Okay, thanks. Efrain Rivera Yes, happy holidays. Kartik Mehta Same to you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Tim McHugh with William Blair. Sir, your line is open. Tim McHugh Thanks. Hi, guys. Just want to ask digging back on to the comment about seeing, I guess, a trend towards a smaller average client size. You’ve talked a little bit about various parts of this, but just to be clear, are you seeing, I guess, slower growth in the middle market and that’s why the average is skewing down or faster growth in small, or I guess, peel back for us why the average is trending smaller than it was in the past? Efrain Rivera I’d say this, Tim, that right now the relative growth between small is tilting a little bit more towards small versus mid and last year, it was tending a little bit more – trending a little bit more mid than small. So I think that’s what it is. Look, I could also talk about losses and sales, but when you net it all out, that’s basically what you’re seeing. And by the way, I just want to make it clear, our average client size has been 17 for the last 10 years, it’s not a dramatic difference, but a 10 or 15 basis points there does make a difference. Martin Mucci Yes, not a huge change, but as Efrain said, it makes a difference. But I think the point we made earlier both Efrain and I think, last quarter, Tim, what we saw was, there was more movement in the mid-market because of Affordable Care Act and the need. That got people to change and sell more. This one has been compared to last quarter that need has kind of been satisfied by those who have it. And while we’re holding certainly the clients we have with Affordable Care Act products, we’re not seeing the interest in saying, okay, I want to change, because I have to have something in place. So we saw a little bit of a shift second quarter over second quarter and again, it’s not a huge number, but it did drop the average size a little bit. Tim McHugh Okay. So it’s fair. It seems like middle market because of that comp issue isn’t – probably isn’t growing as fast, is small necessarily growing faster, or is it just it’s growing at the same rate and you’re not seeing quite as much growth in middle market and feel that average is, that brings the average down? Efrain Rivera Small is growing faster. Tim McHugh Faster than it was before? Efrain Rivera It’s growing faster Tim McHugh Okay. Just when you say faster, sorry, just faster than middle market, or are you saying faster than in the past? Efrain Rivera It’s growing faster than middle market. I would say, it’s pretty comparable to where we were a year or so ago. Tim McHugh Okay. And that’s helpful. What was the – last, can you give us – give remind us of the split between middle market and small, I guess, in that payroll part of it? Efrain Rivera Yes, we don’t give the actual payroll dollars associated with it. It’s complicated and the reason we all do that is a lot of ancillaries are primarily mid-market clients. Our client base in the mid-market is about a little bit over 6% of our total clients. And you can assume that the from a revenue standpoint, that’s three to four times what our client base is, if that helps. Tim McHugh Okay. Thank you. Efrain Rivera Okay, thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Jeff Silber Thanks so much. I know it’s late, I just have a quick one. Efrain, you mentioned that if corporate tax rates go down, you think you’d be, I think you used the word significant beneficiary. Can you just remind us right now roughly what your federal tax rate is? Efrain Rivera Yes. Our federal tax is about 33% and we obviously pay pretty close to the statutory rate. It depends on whose estimate you’re looking at. And if you’re down in 20% corporate tax rate, we are a significant beneficiary but even 5 to 10 point decrease would create significant benefits for us. Jeff Silber Great. That’s very helpful. Thank you so much. Efrain Rivera You’re welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene Thank you. Good morning. Just a few clarifications on previous commentary but maybe Marty going back to the sales activity, horning in on your comment little bit more inactivity or less slower mix, your buying decisions and switching, is that how you’re contemplating the upcoming obviously key selling season, meaning the factor is that the new administration we are not going to know the new rules or and whatever they may do is not going to known really until the end of the selling season. So are you sort of preparing for a difficult sales season? Martin Mucci Well, I wouldn’t say it’s difficult. I just say – this was compared really to last year, so we saw more activity. So we’re – I mean, we’re expecting a pretty good selling season, but it was certainly a little bit slower in Q2 than it was last year. Even though things are known, I think it’s just – last year we had a lot of sales, we had more mid market sales in the second quarter because they had to get, they had to make some change to get the Affordable Care Act product. By this point, most of those had bought it by November when you think about last year because they had to get in and actually many of us stopped selling it after November because we had to get them taking care for the calendar year. So I wouldn’t say we are expecting a difficult sales season but they may be a little bit more inactivity than we saw last year. But I would expect most of that was in Q2 last year. Glenn Greene Okay. Efrain, on the buyback, I think it’s pretty clear but the uptick in the buyback the 2.9 million shares this quarter, we shouldn’t be thinking any change in your buyback mentality rest assure more just to get the share count closer to where it was a year ago is what I was hearing. Efrain Rivera Yes. That’s right Glenn. That’s where we are in. Glenn Greene And then just to clarify on the ACA obviously a risk and you sort of identified what the risk could be, but what’s the order of magnitude? What percentage of revenue ACA is right now? Efrain Rivera I think I was asked this last year so I’m going to call it direct ACA revenue is in a little bit above between 1% and 1.5% of revenue. Glenn Greene Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open. Rick Eskelsen Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one clarify from the release and your comments, I noticed you didn’t mention anything about the operating income excluding float, have you changed how you’re thinking about operating margin and operating income here? Efrain Rivera Not really. I think you can basically do much of the math yourselves and because float is no longer a drag. It’s probably more useful to just look at it in totality. Rick Eskelsen Thanks. And then just the next one, Marty, you did mention about regulatory changes, do you see it as a benefit for the business overall? I guess if you could just talk about the components of your business and where you saw the most, from client perspective, where they did more on the regulatory driven work? Did it drive more people to do PEO or ASO? Did it drive more bundles? Was there any split within the business on the regulatory pressure and what it drove clients to do? Thank you. Martin Mucci Sure. I think first, I think I would say overtime – the overtime rules they have now of course been postponed at least temporarily. That drove certainly a lot more interest from clients in time and attendance solution. So that’s been helpful to get in front of clients and offer them a great timing for us in the product suite that we have. So that drove a lot of interest and frankly still I think it geared up a lot of interest that whether the overtime rules going to affect or not I think it’s going to be a plus for us. When you start talking about overtime rules that also drags in HR, so whether it was ASO or PEO, that brought a lot of interest in HR support. So companies that would have said, hey, I’m going to continue to try to deal with the HR myself internally, now said jeez I think with all these overtime rules who is exempted, who isn’t a lot more discussion about moving people to exempt doing that based on the overtime rules brought in some HR sales as well both on the ASO and PEO platform. And then I think a little bit probably of a drag might have been the fact that okay, now the Affordable Care Act as we’ve said is up in the air, but what’s going to happen? Maybe I don’t rush to buy as much from an insurance or a PEO side do I need it or not. So I think those were the major changes. I think right now what we expect is less regulation based on the platforms of the Trump administration but I think there still going to be an enough change that those things will still help us. And in fact just the level of change makes people worry about can they keep up with everything. If the tax rates change, if the rules change and maybe when to file, if overtime is in or out, that all drives people to say, okay, I can’t keep up with that, I’m going to turn it over to an outsourcer like Paychex who has over 200 people who just track compliance and realize what has to happen and so forth. So I think those have been the pluses and minuses. Rick Eskelsen Thank you very much. Martin Mucci Okay. Efrain Rivera You’re welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open. David Ridley-Lane Good morning. In the discussion around average client size, I didn’t hear you mention should payroll, is that a piece that’s also having a potential drag on the average client size? Efrain Rivera So payroll is part of the equation. It’s been part of the equation in the last five years. They continue to do well. So that’s part of the mix of what we sell. So we sell through payroll, we sell obviously through our Paychex’s outsource service and we also sell midmarket, so that’s part of the mix. David Ridley-Lane Understood. And then if you’ve – it sounds like you’ve fully staffed up on sales headcount. I assume you preset an operation, should we be expecting a bit stronger margin expansion in the second half of this fiscal year? Efrain Rivera No because the first part of the statement David is correct. So we are fully staffed and operations expenses year-over-year were up pretty significantly in the quarter, we called out some reasons for that, that compare gets a little bit easier as we go through the remainder of the year. But remember that expenses in Q3 and in Q4 but Q3 particularly increased because of the volume of operations activity that we have and also the volume of sales activity that we have. So no in the back half of the year, you see our financials the margin actually goes down and that’s typical of our pattern. David Ridley-Lane I guess I was thinking more of an margins on a year-over-year basis? Efrain Rivera On a year-over-year basis. David Ridley-Lane Yes, sorry. Efrain Rivera We feel comfortable with the guidance and obviously we’re running actually little bit ahead of it in the first half but comfortable where we are in terms of margins at this point. David Ridley-Lane Understood. Thank you very much. Efrain Rivera Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Sir, your line is open. Mark Marcon Happy holidays, Efrain and Marty. Efrain Rivera Thanks, Mark. Martin Mucci Thanks, Mark. Same to you. Mark Marcon Couple of quick questions. First one, with regards to the general environment that you’re seeing in the small business arena, what do you see in terms of new business start-ups in terms of trickling up from the field source of new clients? And then what are you seeing in terms of bankruptcies and how that seems to be trending? Martin Mucci On new business start-ups, I think they’ve reached back to that level and that they were pre-recession. We’ve seen that now for probably a year and I think they’ve held everything that we’ve seen would say, they’re not growing tremendously more than that but they’re right in that place where they were. Bankruptcies generally pretty consistent where they have been, maybe up a little at least what we’ve seen. What we see is from our losses to bankruptcies and out of business, and that picked up slightly but again our overall retention is very consistent with where it’s been, at pretty record high levels pretty consistent in that range. So no big change there but a little bit tick up in the bankruptcies, which is interesting. It doesn’t seem like that should happen but we’ve seen a few more losses because of that, nothing that would change our overall number. Mark Marcon Okay. And then with regards to you had great improvement with regards to Flex as it relates to the smaller end of the market, from a technology perspective, can you lay out any additional improvements that we should expect out of the 50 to 1,000 range in terms of what you are offering there? Martin Mucci Okay. I think you will continue to see that level of integration and you’ll see a big continued push on few things. One is the analytics piece that we just talked about at HR Tech much more on the analytics both in the way we report the data and in the flexibility the client has. The other will be continue to be a mobile first design and we are seeing a good uptick in mobile usage, as I’ve mentioned before not only the client but from the employee standpoint. So we are spending a lot of time adjusting our language and our display much more now – pretty much over 99% of the display is HTML5 so it’s a much cleaner and easier use for the client, much more flexible for the client and the employees on mobile use but we’ve stuck our long ways to go on mobile adoption so getting the client and their employees to download the app and use it. It’s growing fast but we still got a long way to go and I think that’s going to be big part of assisting in the value of our products and services. A full suite is there and we are constantly adding to it like the new Flex Time Essentials and you’ll see a lot more paperless. So everything pretty much can be paperless today right even PEO on boarding now is all paperless function. So I think you will continue to see us add to the functionality and even in time and attendance we are adding new modules all the time. So a budgeting module we just added where you will be able to track your time to your budget and so forth. So you’re going to continue to see not only the products expand but the modules within each distinct product. Mark Marcon That’s great. And I mean is there going to be a step function Marty in terms of by the end of calendar 2017 we should see, we did have step functions on the smaller side that were some real benchmarks that we ended up fitting. Do we see something similar to that coming up? Martin Mucci You mean a benchmark from a penetration standpoint or? Mark Marcon Right. Martin Mucci Yes, I think so. Although it’s much more gradual now like – the number of the clients are on Flex. I think we certainly have internal goals as to where we want that penetration to be including mobile adoption. So you will see more marketing push mobile adoption. You’ll see more direct – I think trying to get the employees of the clients and more marketing from that standpoint. So we don’t really disclose it but we certainly internally have our steps that we want to get to our different goals by year for penetration of those products. And I think right now we are on track I think even a little ahead on time and attendance because of the overtime rules. Mark Marcon Great. And then on the PEO, you basically mentioned that that’s going a little bit faster than ASO and it sounds like the momentum continue to be very good and at that same time we have a bit of a pause with regards to the regulatory uncertainty because of the administration change. But it didn’t sound like your commentary would suggest that you would expect any sort of slow down on the just the core PEO, did I interpret that correctly? Martin Mucci I think so. Yes, we’ve seen that pretty consistent growth from the PEO standpoint and I think we feel very good about the career plans we’re offering now and the work with the careers. And so, yes, I don’t think that will necessarily slow down. We’ve just seen that inactivity, a little bit of slowness in making a change in some clients who already have it but I think you’ll see and even with more certification and things that are going on in that industry I think you could see a pick up there and there is no real change in competition. We haven’t seen any real change from any of the competitors from the PEO standpoint. So if you have good plans, great HR service and support and good career plans, insurance plans, we should continue to see good double digit growth there. Mark Marcon Great. And then with regards to your sales people and particularly some of your eliminate who may have left, are you seeing some come back? Martin Mucci Yes, I guess some. I wouldn’t say any major thing. We certainly have seen where people might jump to a competitor. We’ve seen a few of those come back. I wouldn’t say anything in large number but really with the attrition as I mentioned earlier, the turnover has been pretty consistent so we haven’t seen any uptick in turnover and I think – there isn’t many major exodus for anybody to come back. Yes, some come back but not too many. Mark Marcon Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci Thanks, Mark. Same to you. Mark Marcon Hey, could I ask one more, Marty? I forgot. Martin Mucci Sure. Mark Marcon Just on the tax filing float, to what percentage of the tax filing float is actually due to the tax withholdings for federal and state income taxes relative to things like SUTA and things of that nature? Martin Mucci Well, Mark, that’s a good question. It’s primarily federal and state, SUTA does have an impact, but the bigger impact is federal and state. Mark Marcon Okay, great. Thank you very much. Martin Mucci Okay, thanks. Operator Thank you. Our last question is from Mr. Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Sir, your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar Thank you. Hi, Mark and Efrain, happy holidays from me as well. Martin Mucci Thank you. Ashwin Shirvaikar Considering I’m standing between you guys and the holiday party, let me hurry up with the questions. So M&A pipeline, you mentioned healthy M&A pipeline, is it possible to potentially qualify that? Is it going to be more what I’d consider distribution, things like advance partners, staffing, outsourcing or more product? Martin Mucci I would say little bit of both, but probably less product these days and more expansion of what we have. So certainly payroll PEO, other off suites of what – we like the Advance Partners, obviously that’s been very good acquisition for us, good team there and there is some opportunities there as well in that industry. And so I would say across the board probably a little bit less product, but there is some product things we still want to do but we’ve pretty much build those – the majority of those tuck in type opportunities, mostly what we are looking for now and different geographies obviously as well. We are always looking particularly in Western Europe for opportunities as well and so I’d say it’s a little bit across the board. Ashwin Shirvaikar Got it. And then if taxes go down as they’re expected to, would you expect to look for investment alternative other than you do a lot of treasury in muni, so the muni part… Martin Mucci Right, Ashwin. Good point. Yes, so open the universe up to other class of assets that we wouldn’t think about as much today. Ashwin Shirvaikar Any initial thoughts on how you’re thinking about that? Martin Mucci Yes, obviously you look at taxables a lot more than we do today. So we begun to have some of those conversations without getting too presumptuous about what’s going to happen with respect to taxes? Ashwin Shirvaikar Okay, got it. And some helpful clients have typically grown in the mid 20-ish type of range sequentially into the Feb quarter with bonuses and so on. Would you expect that to be fairly consistent this year? Martin Mucci I think the pattern should be fairly consistent with what we’ve seen in prior years. Ashwin Shirvaikar Okay. Last quick question, the DOL rule timing, what was the specific assumption you are already making in the outlook for this or whether it’s not in the outlook so it doesn’t matter? Martin Mucci There is no real specific assumption there. While it’s been significant sales and time and attendance, it is enough to move the needle that much or it doesn’t change our guidance or anything, we wouldn’t. If that never went into effect, we wouldn’t change guidance or adjust guidance or anything. Ashwin Shirvaikar Understood. That’s all from me. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci Thank you, Ashwin. Take care. Operator And we don’t have any more questions on queue, sir. Speakers, you may proceed. Martin Mucci Okay, great. Thank you. At this point, we will close the call.

We will now have the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first one is from Mr. Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Sir, your line is open. Jason Kupferberg Thanks. Good morning, guys. happy holidays to you. Martin Mucci Same to you. Jason Kupferberg Thanks. I just want to start with a question on the Core Payroll segment, just trying to do the math in the back of the more precise outlook on Q3 at the 2% level. I mean, I guess, to get to the midpoint of the full-year 3% to 4% range, it seems lick you’d have to be about 4.5% growth in Q4. So just so we’ve got our models aligned properly, I mean, should we be thinking about the lower-end 3% to 4% [more effectively,] [ph] or are there some real accelerators in Q4, I know you’re not going to have the benefit of Advance anymore, but I don’t think you’re disadvantaged in terms of processing days either there? Efrain Rivera Yes, Jason, I think to call it precisely, it’s a little bit tough, because we need to get through selling. But I think at this point, we’d anticipate we’re towards the lower-end of that range. Jason Kupferberg Okay, all right, understood. And then just wanted to check on pricing as well, that’s an area to continue to always get questions on. I know you talked about there being some lift from pricing. If it is still in that historical 2% to 4% range, I guess, that would imply that on an organic basis that volumes in core payroll were kind of flat to down, are we thinking about that right? Is 2% to 4% still the right range that you’re seeing on price? Efrain Rivera Yes. So let me talk about that. So, yes, it is 2% to 4%. This year, it’s probably closer to the lower-end. We’ve been trending somewhere between the low and the mid part of that range. So we still are getting price. We still are getting volume. So our client base is up over last year. And we’ve said, we would be between 1% to 3%, last year we were 2%, we’re in that range. So what accounts for the difference, it is accounted for by the fact that our client – average client size is a little bit smaller, so to put this in context. If you go back 10 years, go back to 2007, our average client size is 17. But some years, it’s 17.1. Last year we ended at 16.73. And at this point, we are trending slightly down from that number. And so that the effect of that mix is basically taking payroll service revenues down. This happens from time to time. It happens more when two things are present. The first is that, we start to see a flattening in checks for payroll, which is what we’ve been seeing over the last three to four quarters. Actually this quarter, our checks for payroll went negative. So what that means is that and by the way that’s on a same-store basis, I want to clarify that. What that means is that, particularly, our clients in the under 50 space simply aren’t adding a lot of employees at this stage. Will that continue? We’ll see. It’s been bouncing around quarter-to-quarter, and if you look at our index that we publish each month, you’ll see that reflected in the numbers. But that’s part A. And then part B is that, as we sell clients that are a little bit lower than those that we lose, we have this drag effect. In most years that basically is offset by some client checks for payroll growth. This is a year where we’re not seeing that. So we’re monitoring that and saw some of it in Q1 and we’ll see if it continues into Q2 It can bounce around, I would just caution not to assume that that’s exactly what you’re going to see through the balance of the year. But we’re assuming at this point some drag in checks for payroll as we go through the year. Martin Mucci We’re not – just to add to that a little bit. We’re not – when you look at last year’s second quarter, there was kind of a push because of the Affordable Care Act, particularly in the mid-market clients. And to get in and buy those services and therefore it got you in the door a lot more sales, and that kind of ticked up the size of the average client, because we sold a little bit more in the mid-market. So it’s an interesting time with the election to see how much the Affordable Care Act last year versus this year had an impact. And because we sold those clients pretty much who needed it. Now, the retention has been very strong on that product even with the uncertainty. But that was higher last year. It got you in the door a lot more in the mid-market, because they were interested in not only the Affordable Care Act, but how you integrated with the payroll services. And so that may have been an impact. And then as Efrain mentioned on our small business index, we’ve seen a flattening out of hiring in the small business sector, the under 50 employees sector, and for a couple of months now, and that could be around the election or not. So it’s kind of an interesting quarter because of the election and the possible changes coming up as well. Jason Kupferberg Okay, that’s helpful. Just one last one for me. I think in the quarter, you bought back more than twice as many shares as you had bought all of last fiscal year. So wanted to get a sense of whether that’s indicative of any change in the M&A pipeline in terms of the prospects there, either in terms of size of the prospects or potential timing on the prospects? Efrain Rivera Yes. So the short answer is no. The share repurchase itself was really simply an attempt to get back down to average share count. And if you look at it, we actually were still a little bit high compared to where we were last year. So we’ll do a little bit of – on an year-to-date basis, we’ll do a little bit more buying just to get back to flat. Now actually, Marty can talk a little bit more about the M&A pipeline, but it’s pretty robust. Martin Mucci Yes, still pretty active, not always finding exactly what we want, but it’s – I don’t think it’s ever been probably more active from a pipeline standpoint. It’s just whether you get to the final deal or not based on the value and what we find in diligence, but been very active on that front and it hasn’t slowed down at all. Jason Kupferberg Okay. Thanks, again, guys. Martin Mucci All right. Thanks, Jason. Operator Thank you. The next question is from James Berkley with Barclays. Your line is open. James Berkley Hi, guys. Hi, guys, thanks a lot for taking my questions here. Just want to get a better handle on how to think about new revenue growth for 2017. I know you touched on a little bit on the payroll side just now. But through the first-half of the year, you’re near the high-end of your guided ranges on payroll and HRS growth. But this quarter did see the low-end of those ranges, you’ve got Advance Partners lapping one less day in fiscal third quarter questions around the Affordable Care Act and time and attendance, given the delay with the Department of Labor. How do we think about all those moving parts in the back-half of the year, in particular, and what do you think about the ACA and time and attendance, the aspect – that aspect post-Trump versus previously? Efrain Rivera Okay, wow, that’s a compound question. So, I’d say, let me just say broadly and then I’ll come back to ACA and other regulatory changes, Marty obviously will have some thoughts on that. But our guidance contemplates all of those issues. Obviously, we just answered a question on payroll services, revenue growth, HRS has remained unchanged. So from that standpoint, we feel comfortable with where we are for the remainder of the year and for the full-year. We don’t focus necessarily on quarters unless there’s some – something unusual in the quarter that we want to call out like Q3, which has one less day. I feel comfortable about where we are in terms of margins and expenses. So that outlook that we’re providing basically encompasses what we understand the environment to be, don’t anticipate it will change significantly. Now, with respect to ACA and with respect to other changes in regulation, it’s a little bit early to call those. The overtime rules change, at this point don’t see a lot of impact on the balance of the year. It could impact next year and then on what exactly happens with ACA, that’s a question to be answered at this point. What I would say is, if we were to see some sort of a significant movement to repeal starting sometime in late Spring, our anticipation of is that were to rollout over a, let’s say, call it a two to three-year period is that we would see about an impact of 1% on EPS per year. If it was more accelerated, it might be more, but we’re still waiting, that that by the way is more of a worse case scenario, 1% to 1.5% EPS. We think we have other options to replace that revenue. But at this point, we would frame sort of the risk if the ACA got repealed in an orderly fashion. If it got replaced and repealed immediately, that would be a different conversation, we’ll have to wait and see where we end up. Martin Mucci Yes, I think the expectation, at least, at this point would be, it’s going to take sometime, it’s pretty complicated, as you know, and to change it. So and we’re seeing very solid retention. Of course, clients are looking for us to file in March now for them, and I don’t think you’re going to see much movement, at least, through that filing period. And I think it’s going to be a longer thing, which as Efrain mentioned, we’re looking at depending on what happens a number of products. My guess is, clients are still going to have to do something and they’re going to need some support for that. So we feel pretty good that we will be able to adapt to that, might not make up all of the revenue, but it certainly has some opportunity there. From a time and attendance, it’s been interesting that we’ve had very strong sales of our time and attendance solutions. And we’ve introduced the new one that is Flex Essentials, that is a no clock, all web, or mobile punch, much simpler to set up, and we’ve seen an acceleration there. So I think the whole overtime rule issue even though it’s now been delayed and may end up never being enacted who knows has driven a lot of interest in time and attendance. And so that’s driven sales that I don’t think somebody is going to necessarily get rid of that product, and in fact, it may keep kind of a heightened demand now. So I think that’s how we feel about it is pretty good at this point and see what happens next. James Berkley That makes a lot of sense and thanks for the color on the ACA there. Those numbers are really helpful. Just one more quick follow-up here, more of a high-level question. Just correct me if I’m wrong. I believe about 10% of your company’s revenue is driven by the PEO business, another 10% from the ASO side. I think you got PEO growing more quickly over the last few years. Just curious if you could talk about how fast each is growing the trends that you’ve seen, whether there has been an acceleration recently versus past quarters or past years and just going into more detail on each of those and what’s driving the gap between the two growth rates? Efrain Rivera Yes. So what we’ve said about the HR outsourcing business is that, it’s about half of HRS revenue and within that half about half is PEO and half is ASO. So that’s what we said and we update that year. our PEO has been growing more quickly than ASO, but both have been growing double-digits. I guess, that’s what we’d say. The only other thing I would add to that is that, because of the PEO, we report healthcare attachment as part of the revenues of the PEO when we get better healthcare attachment in the quarter than you have better PEO growth that really doesn’t have much of an impact on margins. In this quarter, we did not have as significant healthcare attachments we had in the quarter before, but that bounces around every single quarter. So in Q3, we’ll see where we end up. Martin Mucci Yes, I think we feel pretty good, obviously, reaching the new, the milestone of over a million worksite employees that we’re servicing between our service – between the ASO and PEO. We feel good. We’re very well-positioned. There’s a lot of demand for the HR support. And I think PEO, while it’s been strong in certain states and we sell it across the pretty much all states, it is starting to continue – it’s continuing to pick up more demand and we feel good about the future of it. As Efrain said, the attachment of the help can swing from kind of quarter-to-quarter or even month-to-month. But and again, I think, it’s going to be interesting to see kind of what comes out of. Now, you had a quarter, where a lot of discussion about healthcare and you may have a number of clients deciding to kind of hold, wait and see what’s going to happen, but we see good growth. We’ve been doing well in both PEO and ASO, well-positioned to have both products. So if you want co-employment, you have it. If you don’t, we have the insurance agency that’s a top agency and plenty of plans to offer. So feel good about both products right now. James Berkley Thanks a lot for your color and your time, and happy holidays. Efrain Rivera Thanks. Same to you. Martin Mucci Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open. Rayna Kumar Good morning. This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. In the first quarter, you really highlighted the strength in the mid-market and that seems to have slowed down a bit in the second quarter. I guess, what’s changed there? And maybe if you can just highlight your expectations for the remainder of the year in the mid-market? Efrain Rivera Yes, I think in the second quarter, we had a very, very strong quarter a year ago and compares were tougher. We expect that – we’re expecting a good quarter in the third quarter. And I think, Marty pointed out something that’s important. Last year, there was a drive by many mid-market companies to find integrated solutions that included an ACA compliance solution. A lot of those clients have now selected their solution and the game now is a bit more of competitive takeaway as opposed to selling them on a new solution. There obviously was some of that going on. So we go into third quarter then assuming that we’ll pick up from where we were in Q2. Martin Mucci Yes, certainly feel great about the product and ever expanding functionality of the product. And I think, as Efrain said, last year was kind of a heightened second quarter with the Affordable Care Act sales, and this year, it’s almost a little bit of the reverse. I think people are being a little careful to make any changes until they see what the rules come out, how it changes, and they’re probably concerned about their filing and making a change and not getting everything filed. So we saw a little bit probably unexpected a little bit slower there, and we expect though once we get past the filing date. So expect a good selling season here, but it may still continue to be a little bit slow through the third quarter until we get past the filing date. We’ll have to see kind of how that shakes out. But we feel certainly good about the product, the competitiveness and going head-to-head with any of the competitors in the market. Rayna Kumar I guess, besides client behavior, are you seeing any change in the competitive landscape at all? Martin Mucci No, not really. No, there’s no real new competitors there. We haven’t seen a lot of change in their approach or product. And I think we’ve, as I mentioned, we’ve continued to add new options to our product and more self-service, more analytics that we’ve talked about HR analytics and providing more there mobile-first design, so an increased use of mobile. So we’re feeling very good, very competitive. We have not really seen any change from a competitive marketplace. Rayna Kumar Great. Thank you. That’s very helpful, happy holidays. Martin Mucci Thank you. Same to you. Efrain Rivera Same to you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open. Martin Mucci Hi, Jim. Jim Schneider Good morning. Thanks. Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. As many – as I’m sure, you saw the FIB put up some small business confidence indicators for the month of November, which were essentially stronger after the election than before. I guess, it sounds like from your overall kind of qualitative client commentary that people are still cautious pending any changes in the regulation. Can you give us any kind of additional color on what you’ve been hearing from clients over the last month or month-and-a-half in terms of their optimism on overall business levels and how that kind of matches with your commentary on the rest of the business? Efrain Rivera Yes, I think it’s exactly, I think it’s optimism, pending action. So I think it’s a lot of optimism on lower corporate tax rates could drive a lot of less expense and more to what they could invest and more employees and so forth. Affordable Care Act looks like those costs could come down for a lot of companies and not forcing them to have the product, but we’ll see. Time and attendance rules, although, it’s a little bit separate, but less regulation, I think overall it’s a very optimistic attitude from the clients, but not necessarily turning that into action yet, because they got to see it. So they’re feeling good about the fact that it looks like there’s going to be a better business environment, consumer confidence is also up and FIB was one of the biggest increases we’ve seen in over the 42-year average for one of the three times, I think, in the last to almost 10 years. So there’s a lot of optimism. But I don’t think, again, they’re turning that into action hiring and so forth, at least, yet until they see kind of what the first few months of the new administration brings. That’s what we’re kind of getting great optimism, but the small business index, at least, for November our last one would show still not a big uptick in hiring kind of at the same growth rate it was last year for, at least, small business. So very positive, but kind of waiting to see what happens. Jim Schneider That’s helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, I think last quarter you cited the traction you’re seeing in the 100 to 200 plus kind of segment and the new incremental sales spend you’ve been putting against that. Can you talk about first of all whether there’s any change or in that traction whether you’re seeing continued momentum there? And whether you think the incremental sales spend you put against that is actually adequate at this point, such that, you don’t have to increase it more in the coming quarters? Martin Mucci Yes, I don’t think, I think we’re adequate. We’re fully staffed and feel very good about being fully staffed and out there. I think the only surprise in the quarter we’ve kind of already mentioned, which is a little bit more in activity to make a change than we saw last year at this time. And I think that would be the only difference, and I think that’s kind of more of a macro kind of issue. And so I think that would be the only change. Certainly feel good about, as I mentioned, the competitiveness. No change really in the competitive environment, and we’re fully staffed and gaining more and more experience on the newer reps that we added at the beginning of the fiscal year. So we’ll be able to talk more about it after the selling season. The only real difference from first quarter, I would say is, with the election, which really change quite rapidly, at least, the view of the election and who won, I think that just put people in a little bit more cautious period for switching anything or making buying decisions in the second quarter. Jim Schneider That’s fair. And just a quick clarification, if I could. In the quarter itself relative to the plan you had heading into the quarter, would you say that the DOL lack of bookings or the ACA shortfall was kind of the bigger contributor there? Martin Mucci Well, I don’t – I think the ACA, I think just the election, if I’m getting your question right, Jim, I think the question or the what happened was with the changes in ACA, with the President, with Trump getting in and probably a little bit more unexpected until second quarter as it got closer to the election, I think people know changes are going to happen. And so they’re a little bit less, they’re a little bit more reluctant to make a change until they see kind of what happens. They’re optimistic, but they’re not sure what’s going to happen yet. And so if that answers your question of the deal. If you’re talking about the overtime rules, I think that was very helpful from an over – from a selling of our Flex Time and Flex Essentials and our Time clocks, and I think that’s sticking. So the good thing there is, it brought a lot of attention to, you’re to be tracking time, look at the options that are out there now from a technology standpoint, punching in and out on a mobile phone, things that have not been available generally until the last year or so. And I think that’s going to stick, so that actually helped drive some sales that are recorded in our HRS services revenue. And I think that’s going to continue and it’s going to stick no matter what happens with overtime rules. Jim Schneider Great. Thank you. Martin Mucci Okay. Efrain Rivera You’re welcome. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Gary Bisbee Hey, guys, good morning. Martin Mucci Good morning, Gary. Gary Bisbee There’s quite a bit of demand about, how much you’ll actually benefit in the short-term float? So I wanted to ask a two-part question to help frame that. The first one, as you think about the float, how you manage the float, is it still right, I know there’s some seasonality, but to think that roughly half of the float balance is short-term stuff, whether it’s money-markets, the variable demand rate notes et cetera, and you target about half in intermediate term bonds? And the second question, if we look at that bond portfolio, I think, you said 3.3-year duration… Efrain Rivera Yep. Gary Bisbee Is the stuff that’s maturing in the next 12 months, are the interest rates that you would likely reinvest that in today above the rates of the stuff that’s maturing, or is that still a negative at this point? Thank you. Efrain Rivera Okay. Hey, good question. So, yes, you’re right. It’s – short-term is about 45%, can be sometimes 50, but we keep it between 45 and 50. So that reprices immediately or very quickly, I shouldn’t say – should say. Let me just be careful, that’s an overstatement. It doesn’t reprice immediately. It typically reprices somewhere between 45 to 60 days. So the answer to the first question portfolio composition is yes. That’s correct. And then the second is yes, also. Yes, the bonds that we would invest in going forward currently have yields that are significantly higher than the ones that are rolling off. So if I were to call it today and I’m not doing that, but if I were to call it today, and I assume no more Fed increases other than what we have gotten to this point, the portfolio would be about $8 million higher in value than it is today. I just caution anyone from taking that to the bank, because we’ll have much more granular information once we get through the next couple of quarters and see what the Fed actually does. And the reason why I say that is, we look at and we could give you a big forecast based on yield curves. I distrust that approach. I’d rather tell you what we think our portfolios will do based on what I know at the time I’m saying it, but you can do some math. And the numbers start to get pretty significant, if the Fed does what it says it’s going to do and the final qualification, I’d add to that is the steepness of the yield curve also impacts how we invest. So right now, they do nothing. I’d call it at about $8 million next year, that’s annualized, and we’ll see where we go through the remainder of the year. Gary Bisbee And just to clarify that that’s very helpful by the way. So the $8 million, that is annualizing and getting the full benefit from the Fed funds rate increase recently and also the benefit from reinvesting bonds at what the current yield curve is, is that correct? Efrain Rivera Yes, correct. Gary Bisbee Okay. And then just one other question. The – and maybe this is just getting too nitpicking on my end, but the buyback was pretty significant no increase in the guidance for earnings, it feels like there’s a couple of pennies there, is that just conservatism or is there some other thing we should think about with that? Thank you. Efrain Rivera Yes, I guess, I’d say this, Gary. There’s always pluses and minuses, so you have to look at what you think are potential upsides but potential downsides. And I think it’s realistic, I wouldn’t call it aggressive and I wouldn’t call it conservative. Gary Bisbee Okay. And then just actually one other one. Have you done the analysis and maybe it’s just, we don’t know enough, but about what kind of risk you might face in terms of potential declines in the float portfolio balance is based on some of the personnel income tax changes that Trump and the Republican Congress have been floating? Should we think of that as a potential offset to some of this is the withholding might be less for a significant portion your customers? Thank you. Efrain Rivera Yes. We haven’t started doing modeling at this point, because at that point the benefit, okay. So that’s coupled with a more bigger a discussion about whether corporate tax rates go down. If that happens then even if we face some drag from personnel income taxes. The corporate tax impact simply dwarfs everything else. So that that we’d look at both. So if tax reform occurs, it’s pretty obvious that we would be a pretty significant beneficiary by significant, I mean, very significant. So we’re waiting to hear like everyone else is waiting to hear. So that’s a partial answer to your question. Gary Bisbee Yes, great, that’s helpful. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Happy Holidays. Efrain Rivera Thanks, Gary. Martin Mucci Thanks, Gary. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. Bryan Keane Hi, guys. Just wanted – a couple clarifications just on HR Services. I think the street was looking for more like 14% revenue growth. I know the guide is 12% to 14% and it came in a little bit towards the lower-end, was there just want to make sure the puts and takes there is what I’m thinking about obviously as Advance Partners acquisition is anniversarying and that contributed two points to growth. So then I’m thinking about the back-half of the year with that coming off, do we have enough in the pipe and in sales to actually increase that growth rate for the back-half? Efrain Rivera Yes, so Bryan, our guidance obviously included Advance. We came out of the first quarter, I think, we’re at 15% growth. I think I called out attach rates on healthcare in the PEO were a little bit lower than we had projected. That can reverse very, very quickly quarter-to-quarter, so we’ll see where we are in Q3. But in terms of where we expect the year to be, we are not really far off from what we expected. So I see where people might get to 14%. I don’t think our internal plans suggest we be at 14%. And so we should be solidly in the year in the range of the guidance that we provided. And obviously, as you pointed out, the selling season will have an impact on where HRS growth ends up for the year, but we feel comfortable with the range as we’ve given. Bryan Keane Okay. And then in the back-half since Advance will be now in the numbers that won’t probably push that growth rate, should we think about more towards the lower-end then in that range of 12% to 14% for the back-half as a result of Advance anniversary? Efrain Rivera I would say, yes, subject to whatever we see in terms of sales in Q – I’m sorry, in the third quarter, which is where the bulk of the selling season comes in. I would say that, although, I didn’t call out where we end up in Q4, our guidance is for the year as a whole and we feel comfortable for the year as a whole that may not be that or that may be that some quarters aren’t exactly in the range of the guidance. So if it’s significant, we’ll call it out. Bryan Keane Okay, helpful. And then just time and attendance, how big is that and how fast has that been growing? I know it’s been a – one of the catalyst that you guys have called out just how big is that as a percentage of revenue and maybe the growth rates you guys have been seeing there? Efrain Rivera So last time we updated it, it’s about – it was about last year about 10%, I should say, online services, which includes HR Administration, which is also part of the equation back up a second. So it’s clear the fundamental parts of the HCM platform include an HR Administration module with time and attendance module and obviously a payroll engine module. So about 10% of HRS revenue growth – revenue is online services. We don’t break it out more than that. That’s been growing at multiples with what payroll has been growing at. Bryan Keane Okay. Thanks so much and happy holidays, guys. Efrain Rivera Thanks, Bryan. Martin Mucci Thanks, Bryan. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Sir, your line is open. Kartik Mehta Hey, good morning, Marty. Good morning, Efrain. Yes, Efrain, I just want to make sure I understood something you said about the float portfolio. I think you said, obviously, if the rates kin of – the Fed did nothing, it would be about $8 million. I seem to remember, I thought in the queue you said a 25 basis points would mean after-tax net income of $3.5 million to $4 million. Efrain Rivera Yes. Kartik Mehta And so that $8 million, is there some tax impact to that, that would be different, or did I – am I missing something that you might have said or misinterpreting? Efrain Rivera No, no, you’re just missing some information, so which I didn’t provide in my estimate. So our disclosure is that a 25 basis point rise impacts the portfolio immediately on an annualized basis to the tune of about $3.5 million, $3.7 million, I believe it is. But that doesn’t end the conversation, because then the question you have to ask yourself is, what does it do to long-term rates? If in the end, your reinvestment for long-term rates stays the same, it’s done nothing. You’ve gotten a benefit on the short-term portion of the portfolio, but very little else. The benefit we’re getting right now and I – the reason why I caution about including any interest rate benefit in models yet is that the securities that we invest in intermediate term municipals have gone up pretty significantly since the election, so our reinvestment rate is higher than it is right now. So if all we got was a 3.5 basis point, I’m sorry, a 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate. You could expect that we would get roughly what we say we would get. But we’re also getting a bit of a benefit on the long-term portion of the portfolio. And what I don’t know now and I’ll have a better sense is that, the Fed keeps raising interest rates. What’s happening to the shape of that yield curve as I go out over the maturities that we have to reinvest. So right now, if everything held, I’d be about – on an annualized basis about $8 million higher. What it will end up being, I don’t know until I get to the spring and I can digest the other Fed rate increases. Kartik Mehta Okay. That makes sense. So, I guess, Efrain, will you invest a little bit differently considering the Fed might do a couple of more rate increases, so will the philosophy change at all, or will you still continue to manage the portfolio like you have? Efrain Rivera That is a discussion that we’re going to have as we get into the spring, because if the shape of the yield curve is steep around the long end, then maybe I have a less short-term cash, and I have more long. I haven’t made that decision and we haven’t had that discussion yet. We’ve had some preliminary conversations about how we would do that, but obviously that would be one way to get higher yield even than what I’m talking about on the portfolio, those are decisions that we need to look at when we get into the spring. Obviously, competitors leverage 100%. We’d never – we’ve chosen not to do that. But between where we are and where other people in the market are, there is room to move if we chose to do so. Kartik Mehta And, Marty, as you’re going into the selling season, how many payroll salespeople do you have compared to last year, is it same, less or more than you’ve had last year at this time? Efrain Rivera Yes, up 2% or 3% from a headcount perspective and fully staffed. And I think just getting those reps up to speed, but we’re up about 2% or 3%, which is fairly normal for us and it’s kind of across both small and mid-market. Kartik Mehta And where do you stand in terms of salespeople attrition today compared to what it has been in the past? Efrain Rivera Yes, a very consistent, as some are better than others. Actually some of the mid-market, I think, tends to be a little bit better than it has been historically even, and core payroll tend to be very consistent with or it’s been, no big uptick in turnover anything. Kartik Mehta And just one last question, Marty, you moved over to Flex, obviously, the transition seems to be going well. Have you seen an impact on cross sales because of customers moving to Flex either more or less in terms of product sales? Martin Mucci Yes. Well, obviously, from a Flex standpoint, you’ve got a better integration there and we’ve built everything to integrate into that and then continue to roll things out with Flex, so we’re certainly seeing better pick up from a penetration. I wouldn’t say it’s huge, but it certainly is a bigger pick up in penetration when you’re selling the Flex platform, because everything is built around that, so and we still have a lot of room to grow there. So when you think of the HR analytics that we just rolled out kind of at HR Tech and some of the other products like just rolling out Flex Essentials, which is that kind of lower-end time and attendance solution without clocks, all of that is around Flex. So we expect to have better penetration growth because of the Flex platform and the more we roll it out to clients. Kartik Mehta Okay. Hey, thank you very much Efrain and Marty. Martin Mucci Okay, thanks. Efrain Rivera Yes, happy holidays. Kartik Mehta Same to you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Tim McHugh with William Blair. Sir, your line is open. Tim McHugh Thanks. Hi, guys. Just want to ask digging back on to the comment about seeing, I guess, a trend towards a smaller average client size. You’ve talked a little bit about various parts of this, but just to be clear, are you seeing, I guess, slower growth in the middle market and that’s why the average is skewing down or faster growth in small, or I guess, peel back for us why the average is trending smaller than it was in the past? Efrain Rivera I’d say this, Tim, that right now the relative growth between small is tilting a little bit more towards small versus mid and last year, it was tending a little bit more – trending a little bit more mid than small. So I think that’s what it is. Look, I could also talk about losses and sales, but when you net it all out, that’s basically what you’re seeing. And by the way, I just want to make it clear, our average client size has been 17 for the last 10 years, it’s not a dramatic difference, but a 10 or 15 basis points there does make a difference. Martin Mucci Yes, not a huge change, but as Efrain said, it makes a difference. But I think the point we made earlier both Efrain and I think, last quarter, Tim, what we saw was, there was more movement in the mid-market because of Affordable Care Act and the need. That got people to change and sell more. This one has been compared to last quarter that need has kind of been satisfied by those who have it. And while we’re holding certainly the clients we have with Affordable Care Act products, we’re not seeing the interest in saying, okay, I want to change, because I have to have something in place. So we saw a little bit of a shift second quarter over second quarter and again, it’s not a huge number, but it did drop the average size a little bit. Tim McHugh Okay. So it’s fair. It seems like middle market because of that comp issue isn’t – probably isn’t growing as fast, is small necessarily growing faster, or is it just it’s growing at the same rate and you’re not seeing quite as much growth in middle market and feel that average is, that brings the average down? Efrain Rivera Small is growing faster. Tim McHugh Faster than it was before? Efrain Rivera It’s growing faster Tim McHugh Okay. Just when you say faster, sorry, just faster than middle market, or are you saying faster than in the past? Efrain Rivera It’s growing faster than middle market. I would say, it’s pretty comparable to where we were a year or so ago. Tim McHugh Okay. And that’s helpful. What was the – last, can you give us – give remind us of the split between middle market and small, I guess, in that payroll part of it? Efrain Rivera Yes, we don’t give the actual payroll dollars associated with it. It’s complicated and the reason we all do that is a lot of ancillaries are primarily mid-market clients. Our client base in the mid-market is about a little bit over 6% of our total clients. And you can assume that the from a revenue standpoint, that’s three to four times what our client base is, if that helps. Tim McHugh Okay. Thank you. Efrain Rivera Okay, thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Jeff Silber Thanks so much. I know it’s late, I just have a quick one. Efrain, you mentioned that if corporate tax rates go down, you think you’d be, I think you used the word significant beneficiary. Can you just remind us right now roughly what your federal tax rate is? Efrain Rivera Yes. Our federal tax is about 33% and we obviously pay pretty close to the statutory rate. It depends on whose estimate you’re looking at. And if you’re down in 20% corporate tax rate, we are a significant beneficiary but even 5 to 10 point decrease would create significant benefits for us. Jeff Silber Great. That’s very helpful. Thank you so much. Efrain Rivera You’re welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene Thank you. Good morning. Just a few clarifications on previous commentary but maybe Marty going back to the sales activity, horning in on your comment little bit more inactivity or less slower mix, your buying decisions and switching, is that how you’re contemplating the upcoming obviously key selling season, meaning the factor is that the new administration we are not going to know the new rules or and whatever they may do is not going to known really until the end of the selling season. So are you sort of preparing for a difficult sales season? Martin Mucci Well, I wouldn’t say it’s difficult. I just say – this was compared really to last year, so we saw more activity. So we’re – I mean, we’re expecting a pretty good selling season, but it was certainly a little bit slower in Q2 than it was last year. Even though things are known, I think it’s just – last year we had a lot of sales, we had more mid market sales in the second quarter because they had to get, they had to make some change to get the Affordable Care Act product. By this point, most of those had bought it by November when you think about last year because they had to get in and actually many of us stopped selling it after November because we had to get them taking care for the calendar year. So I wouldn’t say we are expecting a difficult sales season but they may be a little bit more inactivity than we saw last year. But I would expect most of that was in Q2 last year. Glenn Greene Okay. Efrain, on the buyback, I think it’s pretty clear but the uptick in the buyback the 2.9 million shares this quarter, we shouldn’t be thinking any change in your buyback mentality rest assure more just to get the share count closer to where it was a year ago is what I was hearing. Efrain Rivera Yes. That’s right Glenn. That’s where we are in. Glenn Greene And then just to clarify on the ACA obviously a risk and you sort of identified what the risk could be, but what’s the order of magnitude? What percentage of revenue ACA is right now? Efrain Rivera I think I was asked this last year so I’m going to call it direct ACA revenue is in a little bit above between 1% and 1.5% of revenue. Glenn Greene Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open. Rick Eskelsen Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one clarify from the release and your comments, I noticed you didn’t mention anything about the operating income excluding float, have you changed how you’re thinking about operating margin and operating income here? Efrain Rivera Not really. I think you can basically do much of the math yourselves and because float is no longer a drag. It’s probably more useful to just look at it in totality. Rick Eskelsen Thanks. And then just the next one, Marty, you did mention about regulatory changes, do you see it as a benefit for the business overall? I guess if you could just talk about the components of your business and where you saw the most, from client perspective, where they did more on the regulatory driven work? Did it drive more people to do PEO or ASO? Did it drive more bundles? Was there any split within the business on the regulatory pressure and what it drove clients to do? Thank you. Martin Mucci Sure. I think first, I think I would say overtime – the overtime rules they have now of course been postponed at least temporarily. That drove certainly a lot more interest from clients in time and attendance solution. So that’s been helpful to get in front of clients and offer them a great timing for us in the product suite that we have. So that drove a lot of interest and frankly still I think it geared up a lot of interest that whether the overtime rules going to affect or not I think it’s going to be a plus for us. When you start talking about overtime rules that also drags in HR, so whether it was ASO or PEO, that brought a lot of interest in HR support. So companies that would have said, hey, I’m going to continue to try to deal with the HR myself internally, now said jeez I think with all these overtime rules who is exempted, who isn’t a lot more discussion about moving people to exempt doing that based on the overtime rules brought in some HR sales as well both on the ASO and PEO platform. And then I think a little bit probably of a drag might have been the fact that okay, now the Affordable Care Act as we’ve said is up in the air, but what’s going to happen? Maybe I don’t rush to buy as much from an insurance or a PEO side do I need it or not. So I think those were the major changes. I think right now what we expect is less regulation based on the platforms of the Trump administration but I think there still going to be an enough change that those things will still help us. And in fact just the level of change makes people worry about can they keep up with everything. If the tax rates change, if the rules change and maybe when to file, if overtime is in or out, that all drives people to say, okay, I can’t keep up with that, I’m going to turn it over to an outsourcer like Paychex who has over 200 people who just track compliance and realize what has to happen and so forth. So I think those have been the pluses and minuses. Rick Eskelsen Thank you very much. Martin Mucci Okay. Efrain Rivera You’re welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open. David Ridley-Lane Good morning. In the discussion around average client size, I didn’t hear you mention should payroll, is that a piece that’s also having a potential drag on the average client size? Efrain Rivera So payroll is part of the equation. It’s been part of the equation in the last five years. They continue to do well. So that’s part of the mix of what we sell. So we sell through payroll, we sell obviously through our Paychex’s outsource service and we also sell midmarket, so that’s part of the mix. David Ridley-Lane Understood. And then if you’ve – it sounds like you’ve fully staffed up on sales headcount. I assume you preset an operation, should we be expecting a bit stronger margin expansion in the second half of this fiscal year? Efrain Rivera No because the first part of the statement David is correct. So we are fully staffed and operations expenses year-over-year were up pretty significantly in the quarter, we called out some reasons for that, that compare gets a little bit easier as we go through the remainder of the year. But remember that expenses in Q3 and in Q4 but Q3 particularly increased because of the volume of operations activity that we have and also the volume of sales activity that we have. So no in the back half of the year, you see our financials the margin actually goes down and that’s typical of our pattern. David Ridley-Lane I guess I was thinking more of an margins on a year-over-year basis? Efrain Rivera On a year-over-year basis. David Ridley-Lane Yes, sorry. Efrain Rivera We feel comfortable with the guidance and obviously we’re running actually little bit ahead of it in the first half but comfortable where we are in terms of margins at this point. David Ridley-Lane Understood. Thank you very much. Efrain Rivera Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Sir, your line is open. Mark Marcon Happy holidays, Efrain and Marty. Efrain Rivera Thanks, Mark. Martin Mucci Thanks, Mark. Same to you. Mark Marcon Couple of quick questions. First one, with regards to the general environment that you’re seeing in the small business arena, what do you see in terms of new business start-ups in terms of trickling up from the field source of new clients? And then what are you seeing in terms of bankruptcies and how that seems to be trending? Martin Mucci On new business start-ups, I think they’ve reached back to that level and that they were pre-recession. We’ve seen that now for probably a year and I think they’ve held everything that we’ve seen would say, they’re not growing tremendously more than that but they’re right in that place where they were. Bankruptcies generally pretty consistent where they have been, maybe up a little at least what we’ve seen. What we see is from our losses to bankruptcies and out of business, and that picked up slightly but again our overall retention is very consistent with where it’s been, at pretty record high levels pretty consistent in that range. So no big change there but a little bit tick up in the bankruptcies, which is interesting. It doesn’t seem like that should happen but we’ve seen a few more losses because of that, nothing that would change our overall number. Mark Marcon Okay. And then with regards to you had great improvement with regards to Flex as it relates to the smaller end of the market, from a technology perspective, can you lay out any additional improvements that we should expect out of the 50 to 1,000 range in terms of what you are offering there? Martin Mucci Okay. I think you will continue to see that level of integration and you’ll see a big continued push on few things. One is the analytics piece that we just talked about at HR Tech much more on the analytics both in the way we report the data and in the flexibility the client has. The other will be continue to be a mobile first design and we are seeing a good uptick in mobile usage, as I’ve mentioned before not only the client but from the employee standpoint. So we are spending a lot of time adjusting our language and our display much more now – pretty much over 99% of the display is HTML5 so it’s a much cleaner and easier use for the client, much more flexible for the client and the employees on mobile use but we’ve stuck our long ways to go on mobile adoption so getting the client and their employees to download the app and use it. It’s growing fast but we still got a long way to go and I think that’s going to be big part of assisting in the value of our products and services. A full suite is there and we are constantly adding to it like the new Flex Time Essentials and you’ll see a lot more paperless. So everything pretty much can be paperless today right even PEO on boarding now is all paperless function. So I think you will continue to see us add to the functionality and even in time and attendance we are adding new modules all the time. So a budgeting module we just added where you will be able to track your time to your budget and so forth. So you’re going to continue to see not only the products expand but the modules within each distinct product. Mark Marcon That’s great. And I mean is there going to be a step function Marty in terms of by the end of calendar 2017 we should see, we did have step functions on the smaller side that were some real benchmarks that we ended up fitting. Do we see something similar to that coming up? Martin Mucci You mean a benchmark from a penetration standpoint or? Mark Marcon Right. Martin Mucci Yes, I think so. Although it’s much more gradual now like – the number of the clients are on Flex. I think we certainly have internal goals as to where we want that penetration to be including mobile adoption. So you will see more marketing push mobile adoption. You’ll see more direct – I think trying to get the employees of the clients and more marketing from that standpoint. So we don’t really disclose it but we certainly internally have our steps that we want to get to our different goals by year for penetration of those products. And I think right now we are on track I think even a little ahead on time and attendance because of the overtime rules. Mark Marcon Great. And then on the PEO, you basically mentioned that that’s going a little bit faster than ASO and it sounds like the momentum continue to be very good and at that same time we have a bit of a pause with regards to the regulatory uncertainty because of the administration change. But it didn’t sound like your commentary would suggest that you would expect any sort of slow down on the just the core PEO, did I interpret that correctly? Martin Mucci I think so. Yes, we’ve seen that pretty consistent growth from the PEO standpoint and I think we feel very good about the career plans we’re offering now and the work with the careers. And so, yes, I don’t think that will necessarily slow down. We’ve just seen that inactivity, a little bit of slowness in making a change in some clients who already have it but I think you’ll see and even with more certification and things that are going on in that industry I think you could see a pick up there and there is no real change in competition. We haven’t seen any real change from any of the competitors from the PEO standpoint. So if you have good plans, great HR service and support and good career plans, insurance plans, we should continue to see good double digit growth there. Mark Marcon Great. And then with regards to your sales people and particularly some of your eliminate who may have left, are you seeing some come back? Martin Mucci Yes, I guess some. I wouldn’t say any major thing. We certainly have seen where people might jump to a competitor. We’ve seen a few of those come back. I wouldn’t say anything in large number but really with the attrition as I mentioned earlier, the turnover has been pretty consistent so we haven’t seen any uptick in turnover and I think – there isn’t many major exodus for anybody to come back. Yes, some come back but not too many. Mark Marcon Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci Thanks, Mark. Same to you. Mark Marcon Hey, could I ask one more, Marty? I forgot. Martin Mucci Sure. Mark Marcon Just on the tax filing float, to what percentage of the tax filing float is actually due to the tax withholdings for federal and state income taxes relative to things like SUTA and things of that nature? Martin Mucci Well, Mark, that’s a good question. It’s primarily federal and state, SUTA does have an impact, but the bigger impact is federal and state. Mark Marcon Okay, great. Thank you very much. Martin Mucci Okay, thanks. Operator Thank you. Our last question is from Mr. Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Sir, your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar Thank you. Hi, Mark and Efrain, happy holidays from me as well. Martin Mucci Thank you. Ashwin Shirvaikar Considering I’m standing between you guys and the holiday party, let me hurry up with the questions. So M&A pipeline, you mentioned healthy M&A pipeline, is it possible to potentially qualify that? Is it going to be more what I’d consider distribution, things like advance partners, staffing, outsourcing or more product? Martin Mucci I would say little bit of both, but probably less product these days and more expansion of what we have. So certainly payroll PEO, other off suites of what – we like the Advance Partners, obviously that’s been very good acquisition for us, good team there and there is some opportunities there as well in that industry. And so I would say across the board probably a little bit less product, but there is some product things we still want to do but we’ve pretty much build those – the majority of those tuck in type opportunities, mostly what we are looking for now and different geographies obviously as well. We are always looking particularly in Western Europe for opportunities as well and so I’d say it’s a little bit across the board. Ashwin Shirvaikar Got it. And then if taxes go down as they’re expected to, would you expect to look for investment alternative other than you do a lot of treasury in muni, so the muni part… Martin Mucci Right, Ashwin. Good point. Yes, so open the universe up to other class of assets that we wouldn’t think about as much today. Ashwin Shirvaikar Any initial thoughts on how you’re thinking about that? Martin Mucci Yes, obviously you look at taxables a lot more than we do today. So we begun to have some of those conversations without getting too presumptuous about what’s going to happen with respect to taxes? Ashwin Shirvaikar Okay, got it. And some helpful clients have typically grown in the mid 20-ish type of range sequentially into the Feb quarter with bonuses and so on. Would you expect that to be fairly consistent this year? Martin Mucci I think the pattern should be fairly consistent with what we’ve seen in prior years. Ashwin Shirvaikar Okay. Last quick question, the DOL rule timing, what was the specific assumption you are already making in the outlook for this or whether it’s not in the outlook so it doesn’t matter? Martin Mucci There is no real specific assumption there. While it’s been significant sales and time and attendance, it is enough to move the needle that much or it doesn’t change our guidance or anything, we wouldn’t. If that never went into effect, we wouldn’t change guidance or adjust guidance or anything. Ashwin Shirvaikar Understood. That’s all from me. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci Thank you, Ashwin. Take care. Operator And we don’t have any more questions on queue, sir. Speakers, you may proceed. Martin Mucci Okay, great. Thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you are interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. I thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. We wish you all a very happy holiday season. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today’s conference. [Operator Instructions] Today’s call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect now. Now, I will turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin. Martin Mucci Thank you and thank you for joining us for the discussion of Paychex Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2017. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. And you can access our earnings release and the Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations webpage. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about 30 days. On today’s call, I will update you on the results of our business in the third quarter and Efrain will review our financial results and discuss our full year guidance. After that, we’ll open it up for questions. Our third second quarter results mark continued progress across our major product lines. Total service revenue for the third quarter grew 6% year-over-year. Our cloud-based HCM, human capital management services, continued to show strong growth. We are encouraged by the growth in small business optimism that’s occurred in the recent months and our latest Paychex IHS Small Business Jobs Index has shown an improving pace of employment growth since the election. With three months of improvement, we anticipate a continuation of jobs growth and the administrations agenda advocates for lower taxes and fewer regulations, which we hope will likely lead to a more robust environment for small businesses including investment in HCM solutions. We are confident that we are well-positioned to support our clients in successfully navigating through many future changes we expect on the horizon. On March 24th, House Republicans abandoned the proposed bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Therefore, the requirements including the need for health insurance offerings for employees of applicable large employers, the annual compliance filings and the penalties remain in place for the foreseeable future. We have been successful in responding to these needs for our clients and have maintained a good client retention level for these services, and we now expect that to continue. We have recently announced the expansion of our portfolio of partners and solutions that provide investment and administrative fiduciary protection to 401(k) plan sponsors. With these services, we are making it easier for advisers and plan sponsors to offer investment options in their 401(k) plan that allow them to keep up with the demand of the ever-changing regulatory landscape. Our clients can now choose from a suite of fiduciary response solutions to help them with a complicated investment selection process by outsourcing to professional firms. We’re very proud of our leadership position in this 401(k) recordkeeping space and will continue to make enhancements for our clients to keep our leadership. During the third quarter, we experienced some mixed results for payroll sales. These results reflected progress in the small market sales and a continuation of the trends in the mid-market that we discussed in the second quarter call. Mid-market payroll sales decreased from the high level of activity experienced a year ago, which were driven in part by the Affordable Care Act requirements. Compared to a year ago, this has impacted the number and size of clients sold during the selling season. Our complete HR outsourcing solutions have continued to demonstrate strong growth in the marketplace. And as noted previously, we are serving about 1 million worksite employees through a combination of our HR Services. For all of our products, we maintain our focus and continuous improvement in our Software-as-a-Service technology platforms, value-added service offerings and operational efficiencies. This year, enhancements to our Paychex Flex platform, including mobile offerings, HR analytics, time and attendance solutions and paperless on-boarding of new employees, has helped drive increased adoption of our mobile app and double-digit growth of our time and attendance solutions. In December, we were honored with the Brandon Hall Group bronze medal for the second year in a row. This award recognized Paychex Flex for the Best Advance in HR or workforce management technology for small and medium-sized businesses. Paychex also received other important recognition in the third quarter. For the ninth time, we were honored to be named a World’s Most Ethical Company by Ethisphere Institute. I’m extremely proud of this award, proud of the integrity of our 14,000 employees who make it a point to do the right thing every day for our -- their clients, coworkers and the communities in which we live. Also, our training organization were honored to be ranked number 20 on the list of the top 125 training organizations by Training magazine, up 11 spots over the last year. The employees in the Paychex Learning and Development Center do an amazing job, providing more than 1 million hours -- training hours over the last fiscal year. Learning and development is a large part of the culture here at Paychex, and we take pride in the outstanding programs created and delivered by this team of talented individuals. We also celebrated the one year anniversary of Advance Partners acquisition in December and remain very pleased with the contributions that team has brought to our Company. Their performance has been strong, and we look forward to the growing opportunities that are in store for them. In summary, we marked another quarter of progress and growth, and I appreciate the great work and efforts of our Paychex employees and management team during a busy calendar yearend and selling season. I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera Thanks and good morning to everyone. I’d like to remind everyone that today’s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events; remember the customary disclosures. As Marty indicated, third quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 showed continued progress and growth. Here are some of the key highlights for the third quarter and nine months. I’ll provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2017 outlook including a look forward to what we expect in Q4. Total service revenue grew 6% for the third quarter to $783 million and 7% for the nine months to $2.3 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the third quarter and 8% for the nine months to $13 million and $37 million respectively. These changes were primarily driven by slightly higher average interest rates earned. Expenses increased 4% for the third quarter and 6% year-to-date. The expense growth in both periods was impacted by higher wages and related comp expenses due to growth in headcount in our operations area primarily. Expense growth was moderated or tempered by lower variable selling cost. Our operating margin was 38.5% for the third quarter and 40% year-to-date, improving from 37.2% and 39.6% for the respective prior year periods. The improvement in the third quarter was aided by lower variable selling expense as I mentioned. We continue to maintain industry-leading margins while investing in our operations. Our effective income tax rate was 34.2% for the third quarter and 34.1% for the nine months compared to 36% and 33.9% for the respective periods last year. The lower effective income tax rates in fiscal 2017 are due to discrete tax items. In fiscal 2017, we implemented new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation. This has resulted in discrete tax benefits recognized upon exercise or lapse of stock-based awards. The impact of discrete tax benefits year-to-date increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.05. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, looking back to last year, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior years -- prior tax years related to customer facing software we produced. This drove the lower tax rate for the nine-month period. So, when you look at it, we’ve got a table in the press release that reconciles the two; they largely offset each other year-over-year. Net income increased 12% to $203 million for the third quarter and 7% to $622 million for the nine month. Diluted EPS also increased 12% to $0.56 per share in the third quarter and 7% to $1.71 per share for the nine months. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income increased 10% to $199 million for the third quarter and 8% to $605 million for the nine months. Adjusted diluted earnings per share also increased 10% to $0.55 per share for the third quarter and 8% to $1.66 per share for the nine months. Note that these two non-GAAP measures exclude the discrete items previously mentioned. Please refer to the press release for a discussion of the non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the related measures under GAAP build out clearly in a table in the press release again. Payroll revenue, it increased 2% for the third quarter to $447 million and 3% to $1.3 billion year-to-date. We benefitted from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. The 2% growth in the third quarter was tempered by approximately 1% due to one less processing day compared to the prior year period. The year-to-date payroll service revenue growth of 3% includes the impact of Advance Partners. The impact of Advance Partners on the year-to-date payroll service revenue growth was partially offset by the impact of one less processing day compared to the prior year period. And when you net both of them, we get increase of about 0.5% to the overall growth rate. Similar to the emphasis I made last quarter, with the evolving nature of our business to an HCM service provider, our offerings of bundled products to our customers have increased revenue from those bundles that’s allocated among the payroll and interest, payroll growth remains steady in the low-single-digits but HRS revenue growth reflects the sales of more service to the client and the greater revenue per client, average client sites trended down slightly, impacting overall payroll revenue growth. HRS increased 12% to $336 million for the third quarter and 13% amounted to $978 million for the nine months. The increase reflects continued growth in our client base across all major HCM services including our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement, attendance, and HR administration. Retirement services also reflected an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value participant fund. Insurance services benefit from continued growth in revenue from our ACA compliance service, as well as growth in the number of health and benefit applicants along with our higher average premiums and an increase in our workers’ compensation product. For the nine months, the impact of Advance Partners was approximately 1.5% on the growth of HRS revenue. Investments and income, our goal is the same as it’s always been to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term vehicles are bank demand positive accounts and variable rate demand notes. In our longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.3 years currently. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.2% for both the third quarter and the nine months, up from 1.0% and 1.1% respectively from the prior year period. In December 2016, the Fed funds rate was increased by 25 basis points and Fed again increased the interest rate by another 25 basis points in early March. Average investment balances for funds held for clients were relatively flat for the third quarter and down approximately 1% year-to-date. The impact from growth in the client base was offset by timing of certain remittances to taxing authorities. I’ll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $844 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients were -- as of the end of the quarter were $4.8 billion, compared to $4 billion as of May 31, 2016. Funds held for clients very-widely, as you all know, and on a day-to-day basis; they averaged $4.5 billion for the third quarter $4.0 billion for the nine months. Our total available for sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $9 million as of the end of the quarter compared with net unrealized gains of $48 million as of May 31, 2016. The fluctuation is related to changes in market rates of interest on intermediate bonds. Total stockholders’ equity was $1.9 billion as of February 28th, reflecting $497 million in dividends paid and $166 million of repurchases of Paychex common stock. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 41%. Our cash flows from operations were $769 million for the first nine months, a decrease of 3% from the prior year period. The decrease was the result of fluctuations in working capital offset by higher net income and non-cash adjustments. Let’s turn to fiscal 2017 guidance for the remainder of the year. We remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continue with no significant changes. Our guidance for the full year is as follows. Full year payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be at the low end to the range of 3% to 4% that we previously provided. In addition, we anticipate payroll revenue growth in the fourth quarter will be below the range of full year guidance and will be approximately 2%. Full year HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain in the range of 12% to 14%. We anticipate HRS revenue growth in the fourth quarter will be in the range of 10% to 11%. Full year total service revenue is expected to remain in the range of 7% to 8%, albeit at the low end. Full year increase on funds held for clients is anticipated to increase in the upper single-digit. The impact of the recent increases in short-term rates will be modest for the balance of the year, but will become more accretive in fiscal 2018. Operating margins are anticipated to be consistent with guidance previously provided. Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35%. GAAP basis, net income growth is anticipated to be approximately 7%. Adjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes discrete items -- discrete tax items, is anticipated to grow approximately 8%. This is consistent with the guidance that we have previously given in June. Now, I’ll turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci Okay. Thanks, Efrain. Operator, we’ll now open up the call to any questions or comments. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question coming from the line of Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. Danyal Hussain Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on the mixed results in sales. Can you talk about how it came against your expectations? And then in that context, you called out, Efrain, the lower variable sales expenses. So again, is this a function of just a tough comp from last year on sales or is it lower sales versus your expectations, not [indiscernible] leverage in that line? Thanks. Martin Mucci Yes. I’ll start. This is Marty. I think what we saw, as I mentioned, was small market was fine and mid-market was a little slower than we anticipated. And I would say, certainly down -- decreased from last year, but we knew that there was a real bump in second and third quarters for Affordable Care Act sales, our ESR -- our employee, our services product there, and to help with ACA. And I think that drove a lot of payroll sales and other products as well. And that seemed to have some impact this year a little bit in slowing it down. So, I think down from last year because of the kind of the frenzy of ACA buying and so a little bit slower in the mid-market than we thought. Efrain Rivera I think Danyal, the demand environment was different than what we thought it would be when we came into the year, to Marty’s point, as we were exiting the year, we thought not only would there be increased demand over what we saw with ACA but we built our plans based on that assumption. And what we saw in the -- starting in the second quarter with the comments that Marty gave, was we started to see more hesitancy; and then as we went into third quarter, it was clear that demand environment was different than what we were in, last year. And as a consequence of that, mid-market sales, the comments that Marty made about mid-market sales were what we saw. On the smaller end of the market, the market looked pretty robust; we did very well but it was a bit -- that scenario was a little bit different than what we had anticipated going into the year. Danyal Hussain Okay, thanks. And then, I don’t know if you have much data at this point. But, has there been any change over the last week since the vote? Martin Mucci No, not really. What we were talking about there is that last year, not only did they drive Affordable Care Act product sales, but I think it drove decision-making in payroll -- in payroll products time and attendance kind of everything, it was at the same time, everything is well integrated from one service provider. And so, we saw that bump last year. So, not only did we have the Affordable Care Act product sales up last year as people needed to have the product in place, but they were making other buying decisions that I think actually got pulled forward to some degree. Then, what we projected this year, we, as Efrain just mentioned, we didn’t -- I don’t think we saw that as much of a blip because of Affordable Care Act as it turned out to be. And so, we’re kind of -- we got down to a more normalized kind of mid-market kind of buying and something plus. And I think you have the election on top of it and the new administration and it seems like in general, businesses is in the -- particularly in the mid-market size are being a little hesitant to what exactly do they have to do. For a while, they would have thought they would have a -- they would kind of drop their insurance, if they didn’t want to do it. And now of course that’s reversed. And so, I think there is just a lot of kind of state of flux right now with many businesses. Danyal Hussain Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. Martin Mucci Yes. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open, sir. Gary Bisbee Yes, thank you. And I guess on -- did you see in the year-end season, any change in the decision of your PEO customers to take your insurance offerings? And so, is there any revenue trajectory we should think for the new calendar year? Any impact of that like lower pass-throughs or anything? Efrain Rivera Yes. I think you’ll see a little bit of it. I think there is -- that’s part of the reason why I called third quarter at 10% to 11%. So, we’ve seen a little bit less pass-through but I would say, it’s uneven, Gary. We’ve signed some pretty big clients that had healthcare attachment too. But, overall, the trend’s been lower attachment this year. Gary Bisbee Okay. And then, you guys cited at the beginning some of the optimistic data, like your small business survey. And we’ve seen a lot of those forward-looking data points be very optimistic, the NFIB has been on fire. But yet I think a lot of a real hard data in the economy hasn’t really seen that optimism. How are you thinking about that? Do you think that your customers are going to need to see Washington get some of the pro growth policies done before they change or in the small end or you’re actually seeing those optimism surveys and you’re new hiring survey and all of that start to flow through into tangible bookings at this point? Martin Mucci Yes. At this point, Gary, as you said, the optimism has been very high off the charts, and our survey, or our index for the last three months has shown increasingly small business hiring is up. Now, it’s interesting when you dig into that it is -- we’re seeing more part-time jobs kind of coming back. Others -- what we would classify as other services, discretionary services and some construction in pockets where it’s like in the southeast and so forth. So, we’re not seeing a real big jump in our own clients other than the fact that it’s slowly increasing. And I do think that given especially the last 90 days or so, I think there’s just a lot of confusion as to, hey, is Affordable Care Act in or out? Is time and attendance -- think about the time and attendance, we had a lot of selling of time and attendance solutions, with the rules then they got held up, and I’m not sure they’re ever going to go into effect and on the overtime rules. So, I think there is a lot of confusion now. Definitely, we’re seeing, on the index, some employment increases, but I wouldn’t say it’s anything really strong yet that’s really showing up completely in the number. Gary Bisbee Great. Thanks. And then just one last one, if I could. On the margins, can you size the impact of the benefit of lower sales commissions or the lower variable selling expense? Efrain Rivera Yes, year-to-date, Gary, I’d say it’s in the range of about 50 basis points. Gary Bisbee Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is now open, sir. James Berkley Thank you very much. Could you guys just update us -- and I think you talked about this a little bit already, but just update us on how you’re thinking about your short-term versus long-term portfolio mix, the impact of the Fed rate increase on the yield curve that you’ve seen? Just maybe speaking to that $8 million number and updating that that you talked about last year, I think that will be helpful to start. Efrain Rivera Yes. Thanks. So, just sort of level setting what we anticipate. Every quarter point rise gives us about -- the way the portfolio is currently configured, about $3.5 million of benefit. We don’t always see that, so we -- from a projection standpoint, it typically translates to about $3 million. The Fed rate rise that just occurred in March that would be expected to translate into about $2 million next year. But raises that have already occurred will add somewhere in the range of $6 million to $7 million. So, if I had to call it right now and there are no further rate rises, I’d be probably somewhere in the range of $8 million to $9 million with the current raises the Fed has done. That’s with no adjustment to the duration of the portfolio. So again, once again, as I said last quarter, I wouldn’t take that to the bank as we’re looking at how we configure the portfolio based on an environment where now it looks increasingly like there will be, at least this morning, a couple more rate rises by the end of the year. That increasingly seems to be the trajectory the Fed is on. So, we will take a look at that and then update on the guidance, but certainly that’s trending in the right way for us. James Berkley Thanks a lot. And then just two more quick follow-ups, if you don’t mind, as you’ve done in the past just on Advance Partners, just a breakout in terms of how that impacted you on the top line and then perhaps maybe expenses too. So, I think there were 22 days of Advance Partners in the quarter, correct me if I’m wrong there. And then just last… Efrain Rivera Yes -- sorry go ahead. James Berkley And then, I was just going to say lastly, if you could just speak to the sustainability -- what drove that double-digit growth you saw in time and attendance, and then just the sustainability of that going forward, given some of the uncertainty around those rules? Thanks. Efrain Rivera Yes. So, we netted the two, Advance -- and in my comments, Advance and the extra day, the combination of those two is about 1% year-to-date. So, Advance, and it’s a little bit more than half of that -- I’m sorry, Advance obviously contributed a little bit more than half of that 1% and then the extra day took out the rest. So, I hope that’s reasonably clear. And then, I’ll let Marty talk to the time and attendance. Martin Mucci Yes. On the time and attendance, I think one, the overtime rules came out in the fall, the proposed overtime rules and are going to take effect December 1. And so, I think that drove a lot of clients to discuss with sales reps about solutions. At the same time, we added to our time and attendance portfolio what we call time and attendance essentials, Flex Time Essentials, which was a lower-end product that’s more simple and easy for smaller businesses. So, we’ve seen a real uptick. I think one, driven by the overtime rules that were supposed to go into effect. And then once clients got into that, I think they’ve seen the need for tracking time better, and I don’t think that’s going to go away. That seems to have a very strong stick. It’s nicely integrated into our payroll platform. And again, as I said, we have multiple options of both Flex time and attendance and Flex time and attendance essentials as well as a number of different clocks that are now that are now available. So I think it’s just a bigger increase in the need or the want for time tracking. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff Silber Thanks so much. I just wanted to circle back on the discussion earlier about your small business index. But I know you’ve been tracking this for a while. But then, I’m just curious what the correlation is between changes in that index and changes in your business? How long it takes for you to see that and if you see that more on the payroll side or the HRS side? Thanks. Martin Mucci Yes. I mean, the correlation obviously is usually pretty good. This is a sample; this index is done on 350,000 of our clients and under 50 employees. So again, this is focused on the under 50 side of the market. What that showed was that we’ve continued to have small business, an improvement in small business job growth hiring over the last three months. We kind of peaked the last year around the April timeframe a year ago, April into May, and then that dropped off in the fall and then has come back and kind of recovered that. If you look at it on a full year-over-year basis, kind of March to March, we’re about flat to last year’s index. So, that’s pretty much kind of what we’re seeing, which is there’s some job growth but it’s fairly flat to last year as far as kind of employees per client type of thing. But it does indicate that it looks like it’s on a nice upward trend and that the optimism that like on the NFIB index, that’s off the charts is starting to flow into real job increases. But again, if you compare year-over-year, it’s fairly flat because we kind of recovered from where the job growth dropped off in the fall. Jeff Silber And I guess the pressure on the employees per client number, again, it’s affecting more the payroll services line item as opposed to the HRS line item? Efrain Rivera Yes, that’s correct. And just to build on what Marty said. So, if you look at it on a same-store basis, we’re flat to down in terms of employees per clients, especially in the under 50 space but really across the base because it’s predominantly small market. So, we have yet to see in our client base, a significant uptick in client employees. We’d like to see it but haven’t seen it yet…  Martin Mucci …which really ties to that index. Jeff Silber Okay. That’s helpful. And just a quick number’s question for you, Efrain. On the tax rate for the fourth quarter, are there any discrete items that we should be aware of? Efrain Rivera Yes. So, if you refer to the press release, Jeff, you’ll see that we recorded, I believe, the amount -- look on the table, I believe it’s $3.2 million that we recorded in the quarter for discrete tax items related to stock comp expense. So, I called out $0.05 for the year, but in the quarter, it added about a $0.01 to earnings. Jeff Silber I’m sorry. My question was for the fourth quarter, the current quarter. Efrain Rivera Oh, I’m sorry. Sorry about that, Jeff, automatic recording there. Jeff Silber Yes, it’s okay. Efrain Rivera I don’t know yet. One of the things that’s interesting about that pronouncement is that it varies from quarter-to-quarter, depending on whether there are the amount and number -- the quantity and value of the shares exercised. So, at this point, I wouldn’t anticipate any, but I don’t know. I’ll have to see as we get into Q4, apologies for not answering initially. Jeff Silber Don’t worry about it. Thanks so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Ridley-Lane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. David Ridley-Lane Sure. The impact on the days to the payroll segment, the one fewer processing day, was about 100 basis points. Curious if you have sort of similar metric for the HR Services segment? Efrain Rivera Yes, really pretty negligible, David. It really didn’t have that much of an impact. It probably does have a little bit of an impact but not enough to call it out. David Ridley-Lane And then, looking a little bit more closely at the HR Services, how much of the growth that you saw in retirement was related to those fee increases and perhaps market action versus signing up net new clients? Efrain Rivera We had both in the quarter, but because market was up in the third quarter, we had a good bump. I can’t quantify it anymore than that. Overall, it’s not material to HRS results, but it was bigger than we had anticipated. David Ridley-Lane And then from a revenue perspective, was third quarter the toughest Affordable Care Act related comparison? And would fourth quarter be pretty much like-for-like or ACA-related revenue is still ramping up in the fourth quarter of last year? Efrain Rivera No, just the opposite. ACA is going to start to now slow down after Q3. So, although you’re right that we had a significant compare in Q3, we were also carrying through because of the way revenues recognized in Q3, a chunk of that revenue gets recognized in the third quarter. And now we anniversary the uplift in ACA, and it starts -- the compares start to show slowing on the revenue, which is why I called out HRS being in the range that I mentioned. So that’s really driven by PEO and Affordable Care Act. David Ridley-Lane Got it. And then, did Affordable Care Act revenue grow or would you expect it to grow in the fourth quarter? Efrain Rivera It will continue to grow in the fourth quarter and then decline; we’ll see when we issue guidance. So, I think we’ve hit the high watermark of growth in HR -- in Affordable Care Act revenue. We’ll still have growth in fourth quarter and then we’ll see as we go into next year. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.  James Schneider Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wandering could you maybe just talk a little bit about, given everything you said about the sales momentum or kind of a little bit about softness in sales right now? And then what you expect for PEO and other trends. How would you roll that up in terms of kind of puts and takes as we think about modeling fiscal 2018 and the impact of these impacts relative to the long-term growth target of the company laid out previously? Efrain Rivera Yes. It’s early but right now, in the absence of other factors, which again, I hesitate to quantify yet, we would see payroll service revenue trending the way we’ve seen it this year. Don’t anticipate that it will accelerate from where it is on that side. HRS will be impacted going into next year by the Affordable Care Act anniversarying that growth. So I’d expect growth to be lower. And then on the interest rate side, I’d expect that to be substantially up. We’re going to have to sort of put that in the tumbler and see where it comes down in terms of guidance. But I would say that that’s the thinking at this point. I’d label it as preliminary. James Schneider That’s helpful. And then, maybe if you could kind of give some color relative to ACA comments you made before. What are your clients telling you about the market lead out if there’s no changes to ACA and basically they kind of current attempt to modify or repeal it or kind of die, what would you expect in terms of new client decision making unfreezing or not? Martin Mucci I think it would be much stronger. Obviously, I think we feel -- actually, the way things have turned out when you think about it from a Paychex impact, the Affordable Care Act kind of being delayed now and looks like it may take some time to get to change, and tax reform kind of being moved up first now to be worked on is very good for us. One, it gives us stability and retention of the revenue for ACA; and two, I think it will drive some more sales in ACA as well for even clients who were still kind of new clients of that size but also clients who were holding on or decided they want to change for somebody else now that kind of the thing has settled down. So, I think that’s going to be good for us. I think the initial sales are kind of over like the clients or the majority of our clients who needed it, have it. But the good news is they’ll keep it certainly longer. And now, the focus will be on tax reform, which tends to be very good for us, if it comes up the way we’re hoping. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Rick Eskelsen Just sort of building on your last comment there, Marty, specifically about the ACA module. I mean, I guess, you can define it more broadly, but how do you guys view that as competitively positioned? Do you think that, that module in and of itself is something where you have a differentiated solution that can drive takeaways or is really the value that you have it and you can provide it as part of your full sort of bundle and full stack solution? Martin Mucci I think it certainly is very competitive. We were kind of the first out to the market with it. I think a lot of competitors have caught up to a certain degree, but I think we have a very good monitoring tool and have made -- from the first year, a year ago, have made a lot of improvements in the way we handled the filings themselves and the amount of work that the clients had to do. We saw a very large improvement in not only what the client experienced, but what operational efficiency of handling the filings and in filing the forms, getting them to the client employees and so forth. I think it’s very competitive, if not more competitive, but it’s certainly -- probably the biggest thing is, A, it is part of a bigger bundle of an integrated package that we can sell for those mid-market clients, actually anywhere probably kind of 40 employees to above. So, I think very competitive, and we’ll continue to look to see if we can do more with it. But there’s not a lot more development that’s needed on that product. It’s now about selling it and maybe hopefully taking share from some of the competitors as well. Rick Eskelsen Thanks. That’s helpful. Then just the second one for me, you talked about the small business indexes and hope of improved hiring. Have you seen, at least in conversation with clients or maybe for the solutions that they’re looking for, a shift of focus from -- it seems like a lot of things were based on compliance, now your clients more thinking about growth and solutions that can help them to manage growth and manage potential increases in their hiring, sort of like a growth shift in their mentality? Martin Mucci Yes. I do think to some degree there is. The big change we have seen over the last few years is that need for HCM for HR support to come down in size. And so, where you wouldn’t sell that until clients were 30 or 40 employees, now you’re seeing it even below 20 employees where they are looking for some support in recruiting, hiring, on-boarding their clients, bringing them into their business. I do think there is more positive environment where they look to buy solutions that are going to help them hire. We certainly get a lot more interest and really our go-to-market approach is much more now, A, what is your HR solution that you need, do you need help with recruiting, time and attendance, on-boarding your new employees, background checks and the whole hiring phase of it. We have a lot of interest in that. So, I do think that they are feeling a little bit more positive about the hiring going forward. Compliance always does play a very important role though. The biggest impact when you’re trying to go over value with a client is being out of compliance with the number of changes that’s going on right now. And while it may seem like federal regulations are going -- are decreasing or going to be decreasing, we are seeing a big ramp-up of state regulation, which are going to make it even more difficult for clients to comply, if they are multi-state employers. Rick Eskelsen Thank you. Just the last one from me; first, a clarification. For the check for payroll, I believe you said it was negative last quarter and I think that in your comment, it was the same again this quarter. Efrain Rivera Yes. Rick Eskelsen And then for the pricing, last quarter, you again said you’re sort of at the lower end of the 2% to 4% range. Can you give an update there? Efrain Rivera Yes, same. Continuation of previous trend. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is now open. Mark Marcon Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Got several questions. First, I’d like to start off with based on what you’re currently seeing, what solutions area are you the most excited about selling do you think has the best prospects right now? Martin Mucci Well, Mark, I think overall, it’s the HR bundle, it’s having the ability to go into our clients and help them, not from just the payroll side but from a complete from the fact of how do they recruit, staff their positions, onboard their employees, handle time and attendance right through the total HR outsourcing. I think what we really like now is we build this bundle, whether you’re a small or mid-sized client that is fully integrated and allows you to have really kind of a seamless hire to retire, I guess, we’d say, and at all levels of the Company, and you’re on one platform. So, the fact that you can go from having 15 employees to adding labor distributions, to adding anything to feature functionality you want and grow to 50 or 60 and still be on the same platform without moving is we’re very excited about. We see a lot of, as we mentioned, a lot of interest in time and attendance, so we’ve had great solutions there, including the scale down essentials version for smaller clients. And so, we’re very excited about all the products, really we have the offer and the level of technology and Software-as-a-Service and the service options that we offer now, 7x24 web chat, et cetera, all responding to kind of how quickly the market has changed. Mark Marcon Great. And then with regards to that HR bundle as well as time and attendance, how much of the sales are basically going to the installed base or the efforts going to the installed base relative to trying to gather new clients? Martin Mucci A lot of effort on -- the go-to-market strategy is really to offer those products right up front. The old model for us was payroll, and then go back and sell. And now, we’ve trained the sales team at all levels to sell kind of the full solution right up front. So, we’re seeing more sales on the front end but we still, obviously, with that large base of clients, we’re going back and using a lot of more sophisticated data modeling to go back to clients who we think have a need now or that we missed upfront in selling those. So, I’d say it’s fairly balanced but we’re doing a lot better on the front end of selling the complete package as opposed to because that’s what the clients wants by the way now as opposed to, hey, let me sell you payroll and then come back in with other products later. Mark Marcon Great. And then, if I could just go back to the mid-market comments, how they relate to some of those preliminary comments with regards to how to think about next year and to setting up the right expectations? And then finally, just on the PEO side. So, the question on the mid-market would basically be, was it a particular end of the mid-market? In other words, was it the low end of the mid-market where you’re just getting up to fixed employees or was it more on the 200 to 300 or was it across the board? And is there any reason why that hesitation that’s out there would change other than maybe we just have some resolution from a legislative perspective? Martin Mucci I think it was kind of across-the-board, but I would say in the higher end. When you got up into the higher sizes, there seems to be a little more hesitation and less sales going on right there from compared to what we had expected and when you compare it to last year. And I think -- I do think when you have this administration and the amount of change we’re going through, if they had already bought last year, they don’t need to necessarily buy this year. They accelerated their buy. And this year, I think they’re kind of waiting to seek. I don’t think we’ve had a time in our history where you’ve seen kind of that much consternation in six months or so of overtime rules, happening, not happening? Got to have a solution, don’t have to have a solution? ACA, have it, don’t have to have it, now have to have it. So, I think there is -- does seem to be just kind of a very interesting kind of sluggishness about making a final decision in it. I would say it’s not necessarily hanging right at the 50s. It’s a little bit higher, might even be in that 100-plus type of thing. And sorry, and then a question… Mark Marcon Yes, and just related to that, just when we think about core payroll and HRS, you talked about some initial thoughts for next year. I just want to make sure I interpreted it correctly. In terms of for next year, Efrain, you mentioned kind of on the payroll thing where we currently are. Do you mean where we are here in the second half of this fiscal year or where we are for the full year? Efrain Rivera Yes. So, I think you can figure out what the underlying run rate is, excluding Advance. That puts us somewhere between 2% to 3%. That would be my initial thinking about where we go out next year, subject to a lot of further conversation. And then, you had a question on the PEO, Mark? Mark Marcon Yes, I’m sorry, just on HRS, just to be precise. What were you thinking preliminarily? Efrain Rivera So, what I said was there’s two headwinds we’ll battle next year. One is you won’t see the level of growth that we’ve been seeing on the Affordable Care Act compliance product going into next year. That now anniversaries and starts to look a little bit more like a run rate business, depending on how much we sell or lose in a given year. So, you won’t see that boost to growth. And then PEO is a wildcard. So, we saw less -- I forgot the last question. We saw less healthcare attachment but very lumpy, hard to predict, where. So, we saw some very large client attach healthcare and then we saw lots of smaller ones not attach healthcare. That we’re going to have to just work through the rest of the year to figure out what our assumptions are there. Mark Marcon And so does that mean like, okay, maybe 10 to 11ish? Efrain Rivera It means we’ll have to update in Q4, Mark. I can’t call it yet, will be lower than this year. Mark Marcon Great. And then I think you addressed the PEO, which is basically that you’re basically seeing a little bit less healthcare attachment with some clients, but that’s really more of a pass-through as opposed to affecting your true underlying economics? Efrain Rivera That’s correct. It will, but it does affect the revenue. So, I’m attempting to be responsive as I normally am to fair questions, understanding that we haven’t gone through, even a budget process yet. So, but I do think those are trends we are seeing in the business at the moment. Operator Thank you. And our last question is coming from the line of the Ms. Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lisa Ellis Hi. Good morning, guys. When you look out over a multiyear timeframe, can you just talk about a bit how sort of you think about the investments you’re making, either to grow your client base versus selling more ancillary services and add-on modules and gaining wallet share within your existing clients? Sort of how do you balance those? And then, depending on which one, what are some of the initiatives behind that, meaning additional modules you’ve got coming down the pike or specific initiatives to reaccelerate client growth? Martin Mucci Yes, I think it kind of -- the investment is spread by size and so forth. I think we’re feeling good about the products that we have, frankly very competitive. And we’re at stage where a lot of the investments we’ve made over the last five years, and particularly the last couple of years, it really integrated the product set and at all levels to allow that kind of full, as much of the human capital management solution as you want, whether you’re 10 employees or whether you’re 200, and we feel good about those. I think what you’ll see is a continuation of investment in user interface, in the interface and making it easier on the small and even easier to use the mobile apps. We’re going mobile first in everything that we have and we’re building and developing now. And so everything is going to be very easy from a mobile app. And you’re seeing everything kind of be mobile first from us, and you’re seeing a much larger adoption of our mobile app and the use of that, not only from clients but employees as well. And I think we’ve talked about this before. Seeing a large use of the FI employees has turned out to be a good retention tool for us as well because they get used to what they like to get the pace up there, et cetera and the employers less likely to change. But I think the investments are also at the mid-market level where you’re seeing more products set. I think we have pretty much a full-service solution there with everything that clients need but we’ll always be looking to add more as we see a changing market dynamic and what they’re looking for. Lisa Ellis Terrific. Thank you. Martin Mucci Thank you. Anymore questions, operator? Operator At this time, we have no further questions. Martin Mucci All right. At this point, we’ll close the call. If you’re interested in replaying the webcast for this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for the time to participate in this third quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day. Operator Thank you.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question coming from the line of Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. Danyal Hussain Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on the mixed results in sales. Can you talk about how it came against your expectations? And then in that context, you called out, Efrain, the lower variable sales expenses. So again, is this a function of just a tough comp from last year on sales or is it lower sales versus your expectations, not [indiscernible] leverage in that line? Thanks. Martin Mucci Yes. I’ll start. This is Marty. I think what we saw, as I mentioned, was small market was fine and mid-market was a little slower than we anticipated. And I would say, certainly down -- decreased from last year, but we knew that there was a real bump in second and third quarters for Affordable Care Act sales, our ESR -- our employee, our services product there, and to help with ACA. And I think that drove a lot of payroll sales and other products as well. And that seemed to have some impact this year a little bit in slowing it down. So, I think down from last year because of the kind of the frenzy of ACA buying and so a little bit slower in the mid-market than we thought. Efrain Rivera I think Danyal, the demand environment was different than what we thought it would be when we came into the year, to Marty’s point, as we were exiting the year, we thought not only would there be increased demand over what we saw with ACA but we built our plans based on that assumption. And what we saw in the -- starting in the second quarter with the comments that Marty gave, was we started to see more hesitancy; and then as we went into third quarter, it was clear that demand environment was different than what we were in, last year. And as a consequence of that, mid-market sales, the comments that Marty made about mid-market sales were what we saw. On the smaller end of the market, the market looked pretty robust; we did very well but it was a bit -- that scenario was a little bit different than what we had anticipated going into the year. Danyal Hussain Okay, thanks. And then, I don’t know if you have much data at this point. But, has there been any change over the last week since the vote? Martin Mucci No, not really. What we were talking about there is that last year, not only did they drive Affordable Care Act product sales, but I think it drove decision-making in payroll -- in payroll products time and attendance kind of everything, it was at the same time, everything is well integrated from one service provider. And so, we saw that bump last year. So, not only did we have the Affordable Care Act product sales up last year as people needed to have the product in place, but they were making other buying decisions that I think actually got pulled forward to some degree. Then, what we projected this year, we, as Efrain just mentioned, we didn’t -- I don’t think we saw that as much of a blip because of Affordable Care Act as it turned out to be. And so, we’re kind of -- we got down to a more normalized kind of mid-market kind of buying and something plus. And I think you have the election on top of it and the new administration and it seems like in general, businesses is in the -- particularly in the mid-market size are being a little hesitant to what exactly do they have to do. For a while, they would have thought they would have a -- they would kind of drop their insurance, if they didn’t want to do it. And now of course that’s reversed. And so, I think there is just a lot of kind of state of flux right now with many businesses. Danyal Hussain Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. Martin Mucci Yes. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open, sir. Gary Bisbee Yes, thank you. And I guess on -- did you see in the year-end season, any change in the decision of your PEO customers to take your insurance offerings? And so, is there any revenue trajectory we should think for the new calendar year? Any impact of that like lower pass-throughs or anything? Efrain Rivera Yes. I think you’ll see a little bit of it. I think there is -- that’s part of the reason why I called third quarter at 10% to 11%. So, we’ve seen a little bit less pass-through but I would say, it’s uneven, Gary. We’ve signed some pretty big clients that had healthcare attachment too. But, overall, the trend’s been lower attachment this year. Gary Bisbee Okay. And then, you guys cited at the beginning some of the optimistic data, like your small business survey. And we’ve seen a lot of those forward-looking data points be very optimistic, the NFIB has been on fire. But yet I think a lot of a real hard data in the economy hasn’t really seen that optimism. How are you thinking about that? Do you think that your customers are going to need to see Washington get some of the pro growth policies done before they change or in the small end or you’re actually seeing those optimism surveys and you’re new hiring survey and all of that start to flow through into tangible bookings at this point? Martin Mucci Yes. At this point, Gary, as you said, the optimism has been very high off the charts, and our survey, or our index for the last three months has shown increasingly small business hiring is up. Now, it’s interesting when you dig into that it is -- we’re seeing more part-time jobs kind of coming back. Others -- what we would classify as other services, discretionary services and some construction in pockets where it’s like in the southeast and so forth. So, we’re not seeing a real big jump in our own clients other than the fact that it’s slowly increasing. And I do think that given especially the last 90 days or so, I think there’s just a lot of confusion as to, hey, is Affordable Care Act in or out? Is time and attendance -- think about the time and attendance, we had a lot of selling of time and attendance solutions, with the rules then they got held up, and I’m not sure they’re ever going to go into effect and on the overtime rules. So, I think there is a lot of confusion now. Definitely, we’re seeing, on the index, some employment increases, but I wouldn’t say it’s anything really strong yet that’s really showing up completely in the number. Gary Bisbee Great. Thanks. And then just one last one, if I could. On the margins, can you size the impact of the benefit of lower sales commissions or the lower variable selling expense? Efrain Rivera Yes, year-to-date, Gary, I’d say it’s in the range of about 50 basis points. Gary Bisbee Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is now open, sir. James Berkley Thank you very much. Could you guys just update us -- and I think you talked about this a little bit already, but just update us on how you’re thinking about your short-term versus long-term portfolio mix, the impact of the Fed rate increase on the yield curve that you’ve seen? Just maybe speaking to that $8 million number and updating that that you talked about last year, I think that will be helpful to start. Efrain Rivera Yes. Thanks. So, just sort of level setting what we anticipate. Every quarter point rise gives us about -- the way the portfolio is currently configured, about $3.5 million of benefit. We don’t always see that, so we -- from a projection standpoint, it typically translates to about $3 million. The Fed rate rise that just occurred in March that would be expected to translate into about $2 million next year. But raises that have already occurred will add somewhere in the range of $6 million to $7 million. So, if I had to call it right now and there are no further rate rises, I’d be probably somewhere in the range of $8 million to $9 million with the current raises the Fed has done. That’s with no adjustment to the duration of the portfolio. So again, once again, as I said last quarter, I wouldn’t take that to the bank as we’re looking at how we configure the portfolio based on an environment where now it looks increasingly like there will be, at least this morning, a couple more rate rises by the end of the year. That increasingly seems to be the trajectory the Fed is on. So, we will take a look at that and then update on the guidance, but certainly that’s trending in the right way for us. James Berkley Thanks a lot. And then just two more quick follow-ups, if you don’t mind, as you’ve done in the past just on Advance Partners, just a breakout in terms of how that impacted you on the top line and then perhaps maybe expenses too. So, I think there were 22 days of Advance Partners in the quarter, correct me if I’m wrong there. And then just last… Efrain Rivera Yes -- sorry go ahead. James Berkley And then, I was just going to say lastly, if you could just speak to the sustainability -- what drove that double-digit growth you saw in time and attendance, and then just the sustainability of that going forward, given some of the uncertainty around those rules? Thanks. Efrain Rivera Yes. So, we netted the two, Advance -- and in my comments, Advance and the extra day, the combination of those two is about 1% year-to-date. So, Advance, and it’s a little bit more than half of that -- I’m sorry, Advance obviously contributed a little bit more than half of that 1% and then the extra day took out the rest. So, I hope that’s reasonably clear. And then, I’ll let Marty talk to the time and attendance. Martin Mucci Yes. On the time and attendance, I think one, the overtime rules came out in the fall, the proposed overtime rules and are going to take effect December 1. And so, I think that drove a lot of clients to discuss with sales reps about solutions. At the same time, we added to our time and attendance portfolio what we call time and attendance essentials, Flex Time Essentials, which was a lower-end product that’s more simple and easy for smaller businesses. So, we’ve seen a real uptick. I think one, driven by the overtime rules that were supposed to go into effect. And then once clients got into that, I think they’ve seen the need for tracking time better, and I don’t think that’s going to go away. That seems to have a very strong stick. It’s nicely integrated into our payroll platform. And again, as I said, we have multiple options of both Flex time and attendance and Flex time and attendance essentials as well as a number of different clocks that are now that are now available. So I think it’s just a bigger increase in the need or the want for time tracking. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff Silber Thanks so much. I just wanted to circle back on the discussion earlier about your small business index. But I know you’ve been tracking this for a while. But then, I’m just curious what the correlation is between changes in that index and changes in your business? How long it takes for you to see that and if you see that more on the payroll side or the HRS side? Thanks. Martin Mucci Yes. I mean, the correlation obviously is usually pretty good. This is a sample; this index is done on 350,000 of our clients and under 50 employees. So again, this is focused on the under 50 side of the market. What that showed was that we’ve continued to have small business, an improvement in small business job growth hiring over the last three months. We kind of peaked the last year around the April timeframe a year ago, April into May, and then that dropped off in the fall and then has come back and kind of recovered that. If you look at it on a full year-over-year basis, kind of March to March, we’re about flat to last year’s index. So, that’s pretty much kind of what we’re seeing, which is there’s some job growth but it’s fairly flat to last year as far as kind of employees per client type of thing. But it does indicate that it looks like it’s on a nice upward trend and that the optimism that like on the NFIB index, that’s off the charts is starting to flow into real job increases. But again, if you compare year-over-year, it’s fairly flat because we kind of recovered from where the job growth dropped off in the fall. Jeff Silber And I guess the pressure on the employees per client number, again, it’s affecting more the payroll services line item as opposed to the HRS line item? Efrain Rivera Yes, that’s correct. And just to build on what Marty said. So, if you look at it on a same-store basis, we’re flat to down in terms of employees per clients, especially in the under 50 space but really across the base because it’s predominantly small market. So, we have yet to see in our client base, a significant uptick in client employees. We’d like to see it but haven’t seen it yet…  Martin Mucci …which really ties to that index. Jeff Silber Okay. That’s helpful. And just a quick number’s question for you, Efrain. On the tax rate for the fourth quarter, are there any discrete items that we should be aware of? Efrain Rivera Yes. So, if you refer to the press release, Jeff, you’ll see that we recorded, I believe, the amount -- look on the table, I believe it’s $3.2 million that we recorded in the quarter for discrete tax items related to stock comp expense. So, I called out $0.05 for the year, but in the quarter, it added about a $0.01 to earnings. Jeff Silber I’m sorry. My question was for the fourth quarter, the current quarter. Efrain Rivera Oh, I’m sorry. Sorry about that, Jeff, automatic recording there. Jeff Silber Yes, it’s okay. Efrain Rivera I don’t know yet. One of the things that’s interesting about that pronouncement is that it varies from quarter-to-quarter, depending on whether there are the amount and number -- the quantity and value of the shares exercised. So, at this point, I wouldn’t anticipate any, but I don’t know. I’ll have to see as we get into Q4, apologies for not answering initially. Jeff Silber Don’t worry about it. Thanks so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Ridley-Lane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. David Ridley-Lane Sure. The impact on the days to the payroll segment, the one fewer processing day, was about 100 basis points. Curious if you have sort of similar metric for the HR Services segment? Efrain Rivera Yes, really pretty negligible, David. It really didn’t have that much of an impact. It probably does have a little bit of an impact but not enough to call it out. David Ridley-Lane And then, looking a little bit more closely at the HR Services, how much of the growth that you saw in retirement was related to those fee increases and perhaps market action versus signing up net new clients? Efrain Rivera We had both in the quarter, but because market was up in the third quarter, we had a good bump. I can’t quantify it anymore than that. Overall, it’s not material to HRS results, but it was bigger than we had anticipated. David Ridley-Lane And then from a revenue perspective, was third quarter the toughest Affordable Care Act related comparison? And would fourth quarter be pretty much like-for-like or ACA-related revenue is still ramping up in the fourth quarter of last year? Efrain Rivera No, just the opposite. ACA is going to start to now slow down after Q3. So, although you’re right that we had a significant compare in Q3, we were also carrying through because of the way revenues recognized in Q3, a chunk of that revenue gets recognized in the third quarter. And now we anniversary the uplift in ACA, and it starts -- the compares start to show slowing on the revenue, which is why I called out HRS being in the range that I mentioned. So that’s really driven by PEO and Affordable Care Act. David Ridley-Lane Got it. And then, did Affordable Care Act revenue grow or would you expect it to grow in the fourth quarter? Efrain Rivera It will continue to grow in the fourth quarter and then decline; we’ll see when we issue guidance. So, I think we’ve hit the high watermark of growth in HR -- in Affordable Care Act revenue. We’ll still have growth in fourth quarter and then we’ll see as we go into next year. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.  James Schneider Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wandering could you maybe just talk a little bit about, given everything you said about the sales momentum or kind of a little bit about softness in sales right now? And then what you expect for PEO and other trends. How would you roll that up in terms of kind of puts and takes as we think about modeling fiscal 2018 and the impact of these impacts relative to the long-term growth target of the company laid out previously? Efrain Rivera Yes. It’s early but right now, in the absence of other factors, which again, I hesitate to quantify yet, we would see payroll service revenue trending the way we’ve seen it this year. Don’t anticipate that it will accelerate from where it is on that side. HRS will be impacted going into next year by the Affordable Care Act anniversarying that growth. So I’d expect growth to be lower. And then on the interest rate side, I’d expect that to be substantially up. We’re going to have to sort of put that in the tumbler and see where it comes down in terms of guidance. But I would say that that’s the thinking at this point. I’d label it as preliminary. James Schneider That’s helpful. And then, maybe if you could kind of give some color relative to ACA comments you made before. What are your clients telling you about the market lead out if there’s no changes to ACA and basically they kind of current attempt to modify or repeal it or kind of die, what would you expect in terms of new client decision making unfreezing or not? Martin Mucci I think it would be much stronger. Obviously, I think we feel -- actually, the way things have turned out when you think about it from a Paychex impact, the Affordable Care Act kind of being delayed now and looks like it may take some time to get to change, and tax reform kind of being moved up first now to be worked on is very good for us. One, it gives us stability and retention of the revenue for ACA; and two, I think it will drive some more sales in ACA as well for even clients who were still kind of new clients of that size but also clients who were holding on or decided they want to change for somebody else now that kind of the thing has settled down. So, I think that’s going to be good for us. I think the initial sales are kind of over like the clients or the majority of our clients who needed it, have it. But the good news is they’ll keep it certainly longer. And now, the focus will be on tax reform, which tends to be very good for us, if it comes up the way we’re hoping. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Rick Eskelsen Just sort of building on your last comment there, Marty, specifically about the ACA module. I mean, I guess, you can define it more broadly, but how do you guys view that as competitively positioned? Do you think that, that module in and of itself is something where you have a differentiated solution that can drive takeaways or is really the value that you have it and you can provide it as part of your full sort of bundle and full stack solution? Martin Mucci I think it certainly is very competitive. We were kind of the first out to the market with it. I think a lot of competitors have caught up to a certain degree, but I think we have a very good monitoring tool and have made -- from the first year, a year ago, have made a lot of improvements in the way we handled the filings themselves and the amount of work that the clients had to do. We saw a very large improvement in not only what the client experienced, but what operational efficiency of handling the filings and in filing the forms, getting them to the client employees and so forth. I think it’s very competitive, if not more competitive, but it’s certainly -- probably the biggest thing is, A, it is part of a bigger bundle of an integrated package that we can sell for those mid-market clients, actually anywhere probably kind of 40 employees to above. So, I think very competitive, and we’ll continue to look to see if we can do more with it. But there’s not a lot more development that’s needed on that product. It’s now about selling it and maybe hopefully taking share from some of the competitors as well. Rick Eskelsen Thanks. That’s helpful. Then just the second one for me, you talked about the small business indexes and hope of improved hiring. Have you seen, at least in conversation with clients or maybe for the solutions that they’re looking for, a shift of focus from -- it seems like a lot of things were based on compliance, now your clients more thinking about growth and solutions that can help them to manage growth and manage potential increases in their hiring, sort of like a growth shift in their mentality? Martin Mucci Yes. I do think to some degree there is. The big change we have seen over the last few years is that need for HCM for HR support to come down in size. And so, where you wouldn’t sell that until clients were 30 or 40 employees, now you’re seeing it even below 20 employees where they are looking for some support in recruiting, hiring, on-boarding their clients, bringing them into their business. I do think there is more positive environment where they look to buy solutions that are going to help them hire. We certainly get a lot more interest and really our go-to-market approach is much more now, A, what is your HR solution that you need, do you need help with recruiting, time and attendance, on-boarding your new employees, background checks and the whole hiring phase of it. We have a lot of interest in that. So, I do think that they are feeling a little bit more positive about the hiring going forward. Compliance always does play a very important role though. The biggest impact when you’re trying to go over value with a client is being out of compliance with the number of changes that’s going on right now. And while it may seem like federal regulations are going -- are decreasing or going to be decreasing, we are seeing a big ramp-up of state regulation, which are going to make it even more difficult for clients to comply, if they are multi-state employers. Rick Eskelsen Thank you. Just the last one from me; first, a clarification. For the check for payroll, I believe you said it was negative last quarter and I think that in your comment, it was the same again this quarter. Efrain Rivera Yes. Rick Eskelsen And then for the pricing, last quarter, you again said you’re sort of at the lower end of the 2% to 4% range. Can you give an update there? Efrain Rivera Yes, same. Continuation of previous trend. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is now open. Mark Marcon Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Got several questions. First, I’d like to start off with based on what you’re currently seeing, what solutions area are you the most excited about selling do you think has the best prospects right now? Martin Mucci Well, Mark, I think overall, it’s the HR bundle, it’s having the ability to go into our clients and help them, not from just the payroll side but from a complete from the fact of how do they recruit, staff their positions, onboard their employees, handle time and attendance right through the total HR outsourcing. I think what we really like now is we build this bundle, whether you’re a small or mid-sized client that is fully integrated and allows you to have really kind of a seamless hire to retire, I guess, we’d say, and at all levels of the Company, and you’re on one platform. So, the fact that you can go from having 15 employees to adding labor distributions, to adding anything to feature functionality you want and grow to 50 or 60 and still be on the same platform without moving is we’re very excited about. We see a lot of, as we mentioned, a lot of interest in time and attendance, so we’ve had great solutions there, including the scale down essentials version for smaller clients. And so, we’re very excited about all the products, really we have the offer and the level of technology and Software-as-a-Service and the service options that we offer now, 7x24 web chat, et cetera, all responding to kind of how quickly the market has changed. Mark Marcon Great. And then with regards to that HR bundle as well as time and attendance, how much of the sales are basically going to the installed base or the efforts going to the installed base relative to trying to gather new clients? Martin Mucci A lot of effort on -- the go-to-market strategy is really to offer those products right up front. The old model for us was payroll, and then go back and sell. And now, we’ve trained the sales team at all levels to sell kind of the full solution right up front. So, we’re seeing more sales on the front end but we still, obviously, with that large base of clients, we’re going back and using a lot of more sophisticated data modeling to go back to clients who we think have a need now or that we missed upfront in selling those. So, I’d say it’s fairly balanced but we’re doing a lot better on the front end of selling the complete package as opposed to because that’s what the clients wants by the way now as opposed to, hey, let me sell you payroll and then come back in with other products later. Mark Marcon Great. And then, if I could just go back to the mid-market comments, how they relate to some of those preliminary comments with regards to how to think about next year and to setting up the right expectations? And then finally, just on the PEO side. So, the question on the mid-market would basically be, was it a particular end of the mid-market? In other words, was it the low end of the mid-market where you’re just getting up to fixed employees or was it more on the 200 to 300 or was it across the board? And is there any reason why that hesitation that’s out there would change other than maybe we just have some resolution from a legislative perspective? Martin Mucci I think it was kind of across-the-board, but I would say in the higher end. When you got up into the higher sizes, there seems to be a little more hesitation and less sales going on right there from compared to what we had expected and when you compare it to last year. And I think -- I do think when you have this administration and the amount of change we’re going through, if they had already bought last year, they don’t need to necessarily buy this year. They accelerated their buy. And this year, I think they’re kind of waiting to seek. I don’t think we’ve had a time in our history where you’ve seen kind of that much consternation in six months or so of overtime rules, happening, not happening? Got to have a solution, don’t have to have a solution? ACA, have it, don’t have to have it, now have to have it. So, I think there is -- does seem to be just kind of a very interesting kind of sluggishness about making a final decision in it. I would say it’s not necessarily hanging right at the 50s. It’s a little bit higher, might even be in that 100-plus type of thing. And sorry, and then a question… Mark Marcon Yes, and just related to that, just when we think about core payroll and HRS, you talked about some initial thoughts for next year. I just want to make sure I interpreted it correctly. In terms of for next year, Efrain, you mentioned kind of on the payroll thing where we currently are. Do you mean where we are here in the second half of this fiscal year or where we are for the full year? Efrain Rivera Yes. So, I think you can figure out what the underlying run rate is, excluding Advance. That puts us somewhere between 2% to 3%. That would be my initial thinking about where we go out next year, subject to a lot of further conversation. And then, you had a question on the PEO, Mark? Mark Marcon Yes, I’m sorry, just on HRS, just to be precise. What were you thinking preliminarily? Efrain Rivera So, what I said was there’s two headwinds we’ll battle next year. One is you won’t see the level of growth that we’ve been seeing on the Affordable Care Act compliance product going into next year. That now anniversaries and starts to look a little bit more like a run rate business, depending on how much we sell or lose in a given year. So, you won’t see that boost to growth. And then PEO is a wildcard. So, we saw less -- I forgot the last question. We saw less healthcare attachment but very lumpy, hard to predict, where. So, we saw some very large client attach healthcare and then we saw lots of smaller ones not attach healthcare. That we’re going to have to just work through the rest of the year to figure out what our assumptions are there. Mark Marcon And so does that mean like, okay, maybe 10 to 11ish? Efrain Rivera It means we’ll have to update in Q4, Mark. I can’t call it yet, will be lower than this year. Mark Marcon Great. And then I think you addressed the PEO, which is basically that you’re basically seeing a little bit less healthcare attachment with some clients, but that’s really more of a pass-through as opposed to affecting your true underlying economics? Efrain Rivera That’s correct. It will, but it does affect the revenue. So, I’m attempting to be responsive as I normally am to fair questions, understanding that we haven’t gone through, even a budget process yet. So, but I do think those are trends we are seeing in the business at the moment. Operator Thank you. And our last question is coming from the line of the Ms. Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lisa Ellis Hi. Good morning, guys. When you look out over a multiyear timeframe, can you just talk about a bit how sort of you think about the investments you’re making, either to grow your client base versus selling more ancillary services and add-on modules and gaining wallet share within your existing clients? Sort of how do you balance those? And then, depending on which one, what are some of the initiatives behind that, meaning additional modules you’ve got coming down the pike or specific initiatives to reaccelerate client growth? Martin Mucci Yes, I think it kind of -- the investment is spread by size and so forth. I think we’re feeling good about the products that we have, frankly very competitive. And we’re at stage where a lot of the investments we’ve made over the last five years, and particularly the last couple of years, it really integrated the product set and at all levels to allow that kind of full, as much of the human capital management solution as you want, whether you’re 10 employees or whether you’re 200, and we feel good about those. I think what you’ll see is a continuation of investment in user interface, in the interface and making it easier on the small and even easier to use the mobile apps. We’re going mobile first in everything that we have and we’re building and developing now. And so everything is going to be very easy from a mobile app. And you’re seeing everything kind of be mobile first from us, and you’re seeing a much larger adoption of our mobile app and the use of that, not only from clients but employees as well. And I think we’ve talked about this before. Seeing a large use of the FI employees has turned out to be a good retention tool for us as well because they get used to what they like to get the pace up there, et cetera and the employers less likely to change. But I think the investments are also at the mid-market level where you’re seeing more products set. I think we have pretty much a full-service solution there with everything that clients need but we’ll always be looking to add more as we see a changing market dynamic and what they’re looking for. Lisa Ellis Terrific. Thank you. Martin Mucci Thank you. Anymore questions, operator? Operator At this time, we have no further questions. Martin Mucci All right. At this point, we’ll close the call. If you’re interested in replaying the webcast for this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for the time to participate in this third quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day. Operator Thank you.

And now, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett Thanks, Tricia. Good morning everybody. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings conference call. We appreciate you sharing your time with us today, and we all wish every one of you health and happiness in this New Year in 2017. I would like to start the call by recognizing and thanking the entire Steel Dynamics’ team for their dedication and strong performance this past year. They did a terrific job further reducing our safety incident rates, turning in best-in-class financial metrics, producing at record rates, and they continue to expand our production capabilities and product offerings. There’s a tangible momentum that continues to build within our Company and within our industry, supported by underlying market fundamentals for 2017 and likely beyond. Coupled with our existing unique earnings catalysts, lean capacity and intended growth objectives, we’re definitely optimistic heading into the year. But to begin this morning, I ask Theresa to comment on our financial results. Theresa Wagler Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I would like to add my thanks and congratulations to the entire SDI team. We have really had a lot of milestones on many fronts this year, and some of those have benefited 2016, but I think many of them have us set up very well for the coming years as well. A few of the items of note are we had record steel shipments this year. We had our third consecutive record year for fabrication shipments and revenues. We had record annual adjusted operating income of $861 million, and we recorded our second highest annual adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion. And I will note that the accounting folks have us just about $10 million shy of our record, so very good year. For the full year 2016, our net adjusted income was $472 million, or $1.92 per diluted share. The adjustments included three items. One was in the third quarter, with litigation settlement charges of about $5 million related to our industry-wide Standard Iron Works lawsuit. The fourth quarter, there was debt refinancing and repayment charges of $17 million associated with the refinancing of our 2019 senior notes and the repayment of our senior secured term note and fourth quarter non-cash asset impairment charges of $132.8 million of which $127 million was related to our Idles of Minnesota iron operation. As we noted in our December 2016 guidance, we evaluated the appropriateness of the carry value of the assets in Minnesota, primarily at the Mining Resources joint venture. These are the operations that produced iron concentrate from tailings that we idled in May of 2014. We determined that the estimated fair value did not support the existing book values, and therefore recorded the impairment. On an unadjusted basis, 2016 GAAP net income was $382 million, or $1.56 per diluted share. Specifically for the fourth quarter, excluding the aforementioned refinancing impairment items, adjusted net income was $106 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, within our adjusted guidance of between $0.40 and $0.44. On an unadjusted basis, fourth quarter 2016 GAAP net income was $20 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2016 consolidated revenue was $1.9 billion, 9% lower than the sequential quarter based on both lower steel shipments and the average selling value. Our adjusted operating income was $189 million, compared to $284 million in the sequential third quarter. The decrease was driven by reduced shipments and metal spread compression within our Flat Roll operations, as average quarterly hot roll prices declined. For steel specifically, the full year was a great year. Our Steel Operations achieved numerous performance milestones, resulting in record volumes and operating income. Notably, full-year flat roll shipments were 14% higher, driving record total shipments of 9.2 million tons. The annual metal spread improved as the annual average scrap raw material costs fell more than average sales prices. Sales prices were down about $17 per ton, where scrap was down $35 per ton. Specifically for the fourth quarter of this year, steel shipments actually decreased 3% to 2.2 million tons. The result of both seasonality and slow flat roll customer order activity early in the quarter. Volumes declined for both flat and long products, although our utilization remained well above the industry. Lower volume in metal spread resulted in a 30% decline in Steel Operating income for the fourth quarter compared to the sequential third quarter. Steel platform average selling prices decreased $60 per ton to $680, outpacing decreased average scrap costs of $31 per ton. Moving to Metals Recycling. This platform had a really steady to improving price environment throughout the year, along with considered focus on operating efficiency resulting in a significant improvement in full-year profitability. Excluding a non-cash $5.5 million goodwill impairment charge, they achieved annual 2016 operating income of $40 million, driven by a 10% improvement in metal spread. Specifically for the fourth quarter of 2016, seasonally slower demand resulted in slightly lower shipments. However, steady metal spread and focused cost efforts resulted in steady sequential operating income of $10 million. Additionally, the team continues to effectively lever the strength of our vertically integrated business profile benefiting both the steel mills and the scrap operations. Metals Recycling increased the percentage of total of their shipments to Steel Dynamics’ mills from 54% of their volume in 2015 to over 60% in 2016. For Fabrication’s full year 2016, they achieved another strong operating and financial result. Achieving record sales of $704 million on record shipments of 563,000 tons. However, full-year operating income declined just over 20% from the record results of 2015. As noted throughout the year, the decrease was driven by metal spread compression, as higher average steel input costs coincided with lower annual selling values. Specifically for the fourth quarter, Fabrication shipments declined due to seasonal impacts. However, product pricing improved an average of 5%, which more than offset lower shipments and resulted in steady sequential profitability of $18 million. Non-residential construction demand continues to be steady throughout much of the United States. We continue to see strong quote and order entry activity, even considering the seasonally slower winter timeframe. On a consolidated basis, we generated our second strongest year of cash flow from operations in 2016 of $853 million and free cash flow after fixed asset investment of $655 million. Importantly, the quality of the cash flow in 2016 was far superior to last year’s record, as much of 2015 benefited from reduced working capital, while in 2016 it was earnings driven and working capital was effectively managed in a stronger market environment. Even in this seasonally slower fourth quarter, our operating framework allowed us to generate meaningful cash flow from operations of $207 million. Based on favorable market dynamics, we opportunistically refinanced our 6% and 8% $400 million senior notes due 2019 within a new 10-year 5% senior note offering in the same amount. And we repaid $228 million of secured term note debt in the quarter. These transactions are expected to reduce annual 2017 interest burden by about $10 million and further extend our debt maturity profile. We maintained our cash dividend for the fourth quarter at $0.14 per common share, and we repurchased $25 million of our common stock pursuant to the October 2016 Board authorized $450 million program. As demonstrated, our business model and unique operating culture generates strong cash flow through all market cycles, based on the low highly-variable cost structure of our operations and our highly-diversified value-added product offerings. Even after investing in operations, decreasing debt and increasing dividends early in the year while also initiating a share repurchase program, we maintained near-record liquidity of over $2 billion at the end of the year. The strength of our through-cycle cash generation coupled with a strong credit and capital structure profile provides great opportunity for continued organic and inorganic growth. We are squarely focused on the continuation of sustainable optimized value creation. Thank you. Mark? Mark Millett Thank you, Theresa. I think that encapsulates what an incredible performance of the team in all honesty did in 2016, and how successful our business model is going to be through the cycle. But the safety and welfare of our employees remain our number one priority, and nothing surpasses the importance of creating and maintaining a safe work environment. Our safety performance remains significantly better than industry averages, and we continue to work toward a zero incident environment at every location. The team did a phenomenal job this year continuing their success of year-over-year improvement, achieving a record Company wide performance. We reduced the annual recordable injury rate by a further 20%, and 63% of our locations were totally incident free. My sincere thanks to the entire STLD team for their dedication and continued focus. As Tricia outlined, the Steel platform continued to perform at the top of the industry in 2016, achieving numerous operating and financial records. Due to having one of the most highly-diversified and value-added product portfolios in the industry, we maintained an annual utilization rate of 87%. Once again, markedly better than the domestic industry rate of about 71%. 2016 certainly provided a changing landscape to the domestic steel market. Demand from the automotive and construction sectors remained positive. The demand related to heavy equipment, agriculture, and energy while not deteriorating further remained anemic through the year. The year was somewhat of a tale of two cities, flat roll steel versus long products. Domestically, flat roll steel utilization rates were much higher during 2016, compared to long product utilization rates. 2016 flat roll supply dynamics benefited from the decline in year-over-year imports. Hot roll coil import volume was down 25%, while sheet products in total were down 14%. When coupled with the starkly low customer inventory levels and steady demand, a positive sellers environment evolved. However, the fourth quarter was a bit of an anomaly in our mind, as flat roll customers were hesitant in late September and October to place orders ahead of expected scrap price declines. As we suggested at the time, the resulting short dip in order entry and pricing was purely procurement driven and not a result of any structural change in underlying demand. Order activity picked up significantly in November and December. Lead times stretched out and pricing recovered. Unfortunately, the same supply demand balance did not exist for long product steel, as production overcapacity persisted relative to the current demand environment. Although our total annual utilization rate was 87%, our long products utilization was only 68% with our engineered bar division suffering the most. Even though the SBQ expansion into small diameter bars has significantly helped utilization as these sizes are generally tied to the automotive sector which remained strong, operating rates were still far less than we would like. There is good news I think though. The FDA Steel platform still has about 1.5 million to two million tons of unused existing production in shipping capability, and most of the products would potentially be consumed by infrastructure and large civil engineering projects. Although no one can be certain, recent conversations suggest that it is highly likely that the new administration will keep their word and execute on a broad-based infrastructure plan which is deeply needed in our country. Columbus provides another significant earnings catalyst for us. The change the team has made are nothing short of transformational. The successful market and product diversification that has been achieved over the last two years is one of the key differentiators for the improved profitability that we realized in 2016, and will be key in the coming years as well. It’s a very exciting time for the Columbus team, as they continue to focus on product diversification and increasing their value-added product capabilities. The team shipped prime Galvalume product in the second half of 2016, and the paint line was successfully commissioned in the fourth quarter with production starting in December about a month earlier. Prime painted product is already being shipped. The total $100 million investment provides 250,000 tons of annual coating capability, and further diversification into some of our highest margin products. We have two existing paint lines in Indiana, but this new line allows for high-quality double-wide steel and access to the southern U.S. and Mexican markets. Our existing painted steel customer base is excited to have the geographic and product diversification and optionality. Our Steel platform also continues to benefit from other organic growth investments as well. The $22 million investment for an additional 600,000 tons of annual flat roll pickering capability at our Butler flat roll division ramped up in 2016. The addition has meaningfully increased value-added sales. The $15 million investment to increase annual galvanizing productivity by an additional 180,000 tons at the Butler flat roll division is underway. We anticipate commissioning this summer with increased production capability through the second half of this year. Also, the recently announced $28 million investment at our Roanoke bar division to utilize excess melting and casting capability by adding equipment that will allow for multi-strand slitting and rebar finishing. With a highly competitive cost structure, we expect to have a strong market penetration being the only non-competing supplier of rebar to independent rebar fabricators. Commissioning should commence at the end of 2017. The operation and profitability of our Metals Recycling platform remained steady in the fourth quarter, despite weaker demand due to lower seasonal domestic steel mill utilization. Lower shipments and slightly lower metal spread were offset by the benefit from the team’s continued focus on cost reductions, and better alignment of our Metals Recycling assets. In December, we entered into an agreement to sell some of our recycling assets in the Southeast and the U.S. We believe this transaction will benefit both parties, as these assets are non-core to our own Steel Operations and have closer proximity to the buyers’ steel production facilities. The transaction better aligns our existing metals recycling locations to directly serve our own mills. While it’s always difficult to part ways with our employees, we are confident that the buyer will provide a good home for them. While the team achieved a significant improvement in profitability during 2016, we see additional positive momentum for 2017. With the expectation of a continued strong U.S. dollar and relatively low scrap exports, we anticipate ample scrap supply and expect the pricing environment to stabilize as the year progresses. The Fabrication platform continues its ongoing historically strong performance, achieving record shipments in 2016. We have a great market penetration across all our product offerings. Since our acquisition of additional deck assets a little more than a year ago, we have gained considerable market share for deck. Approaching 30% for the full year of 2016, compared to only 24% prior to the acquisition. Our Fabrication Operations purchased 330,000 tons of steel from our own SDI mills in 2016. The power of pull-through volume from our Fabrication platform or steel that can be sourced from our own steel mills was critical in 2015 and beneficial in 2016 as well. This pull-through strategy remains one of our focuses for ongoing growth. The new millennium team continues to perform exceptionally, levering our national footprint. The strength of this business provides positive insight also into the continued strength in non-residential construction activity, which has been steady with the opportunity for growth in 2017. Relative to the macro environment, the Steel consuming sectors that were weak in 2015, such as energy and heavy equipment and agriculture, remained so in 2016. And those sectors that have been strong or recovering are continuing this path, such as automotive and construction. Reduced imports and lower than historically normal custom inventory levels coupled with steady demand have created a year-over-year improved environment for flat roll products that we expect to continue into 2017. We have a constructive view on our domestic steel consumption in the coming years. Domestic automotive production may be edging off record levels, but we believe total 2017 NAFTA production will grow slightly as Mexico continues to grow production with the current assets in place. This is highly complementary to our commerce division’s automotive strategy. We believe there will be additional growth in the construction sector, especially for larger public sector infrastructure projects, which would greatly benefit our long products group. We also expect to see strong improvement activity within the energy sector. Going forward, we will continue to focus on adding value-added products to our portfolio that help insulate us from imports and create long-lasting customer partnerships such as our painted flat roll steel, highly engineered SBQ, and longer length rail. Our business model and execution on our long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our industry. Customer focus coupled with our market diversification and low-cost operatings will support our ability to remain our best-in-class financial performance and differentiation. The Company and the team is poised for continued growth. And the strong character and determination of our employees provides the foundation for our success. I would like to take the opportunity to thank each and every one of them for their hard work and dedication, and remind them safety is always the first priority. We continue to focus on providing superior value for our Company, customers, employees and shareholders alike, and look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone in the years ahead. So again, thank you for your time today. And Donna, please open the call for our questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Evan Kurtz of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Evan Kurtz Good morning, Mark and Theresa. Theresa Wagler Morning. Mark Millett Good morning. Evan Kurtz I will ask a question on scrap. Just hearing recently that in Turkey, the scrap has come under a lot of pressure. And I am just wondering how that is influencing the conversations right now in the U.S. scrap market right now? Seasonally, demand is probably picking up a little bit. And I’m wondering if that is going to mute some of the impact from what we’re seeing on the export front? Russ Rinn Evan, this is Russ. I think what we’re seeing and what we see is we think probably December and January markets got a little hotter than they probably should have. So I am anticipating we will see a mild correction in February and maybe a little bit in March, but I think beyond that I think we’re seeing a pretty robust market. I think the demand for our steel products continues. So I do not think we’re going to see the corrections we’ve seen over the last couple of years. I think there will be a mild retrenchment and we will go from there. Evan Kurtz And maybe just a… Mark Millett Just to kind of color that as to SDI specifically, a stable market sort of pricing environment should really aid the recycling profitability of OmniSource. The last two years, 2015 and 2016, you saw kind of prolonged downward trend in pricing. And when you’re working in kind of an inventory based by it one month sell it the next, it is tough to make the spread. So it’s just a stable, stable environment going through the year, I think is going to be positive for us. And I think Russ and the team have done a terrific job. You just look at the fourth quarter, volumes were down, margins were down, but our profitability was flat. And that was driven by a lot of cost containment, much of which was – came from the realignment of assets and we anticipate continued cost efficiencies there of probably $10 million or so. With the idling of the Wilmington shredder, Smithfield shredders, and with the sales of the Carolina and Georgia assets. Evan Kurtz Great, thanks for the color. Maybe just one follow-up on that. Since it does seem like scrap may soften a bit in the first quarter and given your comments on some of the positive market dynamics on steel, would you expect metal margins the first quarter to expand versus the fourth quarter? Mark Millett I think that’s a good assumption. Evan Kurtz Great, thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Gagliano of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. David Gagliano Great. Thanks. My question was similar to what Evan just asked. I was curious about metal margins. Just to follow-up on that and as an add-on, can you frame just sort of given the current environment and the outlook for scrap, can you frame roughly the magnitude of the expected expansion metal margins, number one? And then number two, can you also give us some commentary regarding first-quarter volumes relative to the fourth quarter as well? Mark Millett Well as you know, David, we would refrain from quantifying the margin expansion and again where the first quarter still unraveling. But we would anticipate expanded margin, and we would anticipate from what we see in the marketplace, volume expansion as well. And just to maybe preempt a question on the markets. And if I bifurcate that into flat roll and long products, in sheet, we believe the supply-side tightness will be sustained. When you look at the December eminent CI data, it showed the typical seasonal decline in shipments but inventories remain at historically low levels. But we believe the import volumes will remain constrained with the duties in place. The arbitrage against global price and it’s certainly reversed and there is less import interest out there. Mill lead times for the industry and certainly for ourselves are healthy. Hot roll coil for us is at four to six week tag, and coated and coiled roll sheet is six plus weeks out. And the industry utilization, albeit at 71%, 72%, obviously flat roll is as much higher as an industry in general. So we believe the supply side is healthy and positive. On the demand side, demand remains pretty healthy and I think we should see growth. And again, I am just specifically talking about sheet. If NAFTA order will remain strong and SDI is certainly increasing its market share through the Columbus mill and Mexico activities. Non-residential continues incremental growth, I believe. The ABI has been positive, and it’s been gone for the last three months I think. And Chris’ group, New Millennium Building Systems’ order activity, inquiry and bookings remains very, very strong there, which is good. As Theresa indicated, we have about 1.5 million, 2 million tons of latent capacity that is correlated strongly with non-residential construction. So as that incremental growth continues, we will benefit and certainly we’ll get a major boost from what I believe is an inevitable infrastructure spend. On then once out there, I think people are going to be very, very surprised with the strength in the energy recovery. We talked last quarter about we started to see glimpses, but has strengthened dramatically. Our rig count is growing, energy pricing is going to be sustained we believe at that $50 or more, and we think on the flat roll sort of scalp side there is a lot less inventory or pipe or usable pipe than is anticipated. We are seeing significant pickup in order activity at Converse just the past four weeks. Their pipeline projects have taken off, and I think it is going to grow and surprise us all. So in general, we anticipate a positive flat roll market, sheet pricing we think will continue or should appreciate through the year, and the first-quarter volumes should pick up a little and margins expand. In long products, again as I said earlier, unlike sheet the overcapacity does persist, but we’re starting to see a market change in customer sentiment, and market dynamics turning very, very positive, I believe. Beams remain under pressure from overcapacity, but consumption should grow as non-residential continues to grow. Specific to SDI, I think the team has done a great job expanding the product portfolio and we will continue to do that with angles in 2017. That seeing fabricator – or the fabricators are reporting strong order inquiry and are building backlog. And again, there should be an infrastructure spend there. So I think structural arena has got some positive momentum. Class one rail, although CapEx for the class one’s has softened some, again, the team has been expanding the product range, getting into the high carbon grades and different sections and we think that the volumes will remain strong and flat through the year. And similarly, merchant shapes seems to be showing some signs of recovery with the fabricators having stronger backlogs and service centers restocking. But most significantly, and I think we’re excited, is a very strong rebound in engineered bar and SBQ. It has taken place probably in the last four to five weeks. But the team is probably more optimistic now than it has been in 2 or 3 years, and the customers are definitely in a markedly significant difference frame of mind. And they are starting to pull out there orders or pullout from their forecasts, and it is most noticeably in the oil patch. We’ve seen the tubers and the forages are significantly stronger than we have seen for a very long time. And I think we are even seeing a rebound in Caterpillar off-road. So we’re excited about that. So long products in general, we believe is – it’s going to see some good growth through the year. Evan Kurtz That’s helpful. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Korn of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Justin Kwan Hey, everyone. This is Justin filling in for Matt. Theresa Wagler Morning. Justin Kwan I was wondering, have you guys had a chance to interact with anyone from the new administration yet? And if you have, what have the talks been about? Mark Millett We have not. Justin Kwan Okay. Mark Millett Have we? Everyone is shaking their head no. Justin Kwan Okay. And then just one more. Did the potential for reopening NAFTA cause any complications with marketing plans with Columbus and the shipments to Mexico at all, or is there anything we’re missing on that? Mark Millett No, we are continuing to look at Mexico as a strong marketplace for us. There are a lot of existing assets in place there. You just have to travel through the industrial centers there. Consumption is massive, and we’re not looking for a large portion of that. We shipped 200,000 tons into Mexico last year, and the intent is to increase that to around about 400,000 tons. And I think we are confident that it’s going to happen. Again, I think with the new administration, you have got some very, very positive things that they reportedly want to do, tax reform, trade, some sensible regulation. The balance is going to be not to shut down trade with Mexico or Canada or – I guess we need flow going both ways across the borders. But we are going forward, but we are not planned. Justin Kwan Okay. Thanks, everybody. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tony Rizzuto of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Tony Rizzuto Thanks very much. Good morning, Mark, Theresa, and Russ. Just got a couple questions here if I maybe. The first one is, Mark, on your comments over the latent capacity that you have. Over what time period do you envision that you would be able to operate that more fully and be able to achieve that 1.5 million to 2 million tons? Mark Millett I think that it’s probably the second half of the year that we’ll ramp into that. We are going to see volume growth through – in the first half compared to the fourth quarter for sure. But from an infrastructure build, that will ramp up obviously. And you have two sectors there, you have the fast track where there’s numerous projects already kind of lined up and they will likely, and we’re starting to see them more I think, but they will likely come on in the second quarter. And then any infrastructure buildout from the new administration, that’s probably a second half and going into… Tony Rizzuto Okay. And then, if I may, just there’s a lot of things arguably about the new administration, which are very supportive to the steel demand and the steel industry in general. And maybe following up on the question about NAFTA, are there any other areas that worry you about any potential outcomes with new policy? What is most concerning to you potentially? Mark Millett Again, everything is speculative I think right now, Tony. I think they’ve come out with guns blazing and following up on the some of their promises. And I think tax reform, as I said, tax reform and sensible regulation will certainly help the country have a more positive business climate and boost the economy. And their position on trade, I think – we are already benefiting dramatically from the cases that were approved last year. They can only sort of vulcanize that environment. I think the sensitivities or the balance is trade and not getting into a trade war, and hopefully we have some sensible people advising that new administration and we won’t get that point. Tony Rizzuto Thanks, Mark. I appreciate that. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brett Levy of Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question. Brett Levy Hey, Mark, hey, Theresa. Is it on your plate at all to consider adding any assets in Mexico, and have you heard anything from competitors or, I don’t know, even substitute products that sort of thing, to add capacity to address the capacity that is already left for Mexico? Mark Millett I guess our strategy in Mexico currently, Brett, is commercial more than bricks and mortar. Brett Levy So continue to send stuff that way. I mean, is there any advantage to putting SBQ or any other form of capacity there as opposed to shipping it to them? Mark Millett We’re not looking at that I would suggest currently. They obviously are steel short. They import pretty much all oil products, but that is not something that we are considering right this second. Brett Levy All right. Thanks very much, guys. Operator Thank you. Our question is coming from Seth Rosenfeld of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Seth Rosenfeld Good morning. I have a couple questions on the outlook for the long steel market. Can you just comment about more on what you’re currently seeing for long steel import trends into the U.S.? In 2017, have you already seen some countries begin back out of the U.S. proactively following the law into the most recent rebar trade case? And can you give us a little bit of a sense of what level of confidence you have looking forward, both with regards to the Turkey trade case also including two other Asian peers? And also the Mexican tariff review, what impact could that have in the market various scenarios? Thank you. Glenn Pushis Good morning. This is Glenn Pushis. The rebar trade case, we are involved in it but we’re just not a real big player in that sector. At this point, we do maybe 50,000 or 60,000 tons in arguably about 9 million ton market here in North America. So it is really hard for me to answer any of those questions, Mark, with much distinct knowledge about that. Seth Rosenfeld Okay, thank you. I guess then looking the other areas of long steel where you’re more focused like SBQ. You commented very positive on the demand trends. Can you just talk about what headwinds you could see the market with regards to other local capacity domestically within the U.S., or if you could see the risk of imports once again coming in should those prices really start to pick up as you mentioned earlier? Mark Millett Again, our focus at Pittsboro is principally in engineered bar not in commercial commodity type SBQ. The import pressure comes in just 1-inch RAND 1045, 1018 commodity type materials. The team has done a phenomenal job down there building relationships with the Caterpillars and their automotive, the forches whereby it can take 2 or 3 years to get qualified for a certain application. Those cannot be substituted one month in one month out by imports. So I do not believe SBQ is dramatically impacted from – or at least our SBQ business, dramatically impacted from import pressure. Seth Rosenfeld Okay, thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Gambardella of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Gambardella Good morning and congratulations on another good quarter. Mark Millett Thank you, Mike. Michael Gambardella You’re welcome, Mark thanks. I was watching CNN on Tuesday, the second day that Trump was in the office, and noticed that the U.S. Steel’s CEO was standing there next to Trump smiling in the White House office. And I was just stunned over the last 35 years of following this industry to think that a steel executive would be invited into the White House the second day a president was in the office just shocked me. What do you think you can expect to get out of Washington on the trade front? Even I would say on the sheet side, even if they could strictly enforce the laws that are on the books right now would be a big positive for you and the rest of the players in the sheet market, and I’m really talking about the diversion that China is doing through Vietnam and other countries to evade the trade tariffs that they have in place. Because legally, you would think China wouldn’t be able to export a pound of sheet steel into the U.S. given the tariffs they have on hot roll, cold roll, and coated, recently. What are your expectations for strict enforcement of the trade laws that we have right now coming out of Washington? Mark Millett I think you actually likely answered your own question, Michael. I believe there will be vigorous enforcement of the anti-circumvention laws. If you consider the whack-a-mole we saw last year with Vietnam, I think Vietnam ended with 800,000 tons of the coated product coming in which is huge, huge volume. That, and as you know there is a case or intervention pending there and I think that will end positively. Certainly the rhetoric and the trade position that we’re seeing out of Washington right this second gives you a high likelihood or high probability that that will be successful. And that is very meaningful, certainly meaningful for us with the Galvalume product that has been coming in and the building product commodity prepayments coming in. Just the non-market subsidization, and I think a strong point will be just taking action on the currency manipulation by China. Michael Gambardella What other benefits could you see coming out of trade in terms of regulations that you – that may have been imposed on you guys over the last five, eight years? Mark Millett Well if you look in that timeframe, and I do not know whether you are implying or inferring like a section 201 type activity, again, it would just be speculative for us to talk about at this moment. Michael Gambardella Okay. All right. Thanks a lot and congratulations again, Mark. Mark Millett Thank you. Mike, just I guess one thought. Relative to the trade cases that we already have in place, because I think it’s illustrative to look at the downturn in Q4 of 2015 and the recent one in 2016. Both are relatively procurement driven. But you had in 2015, hot roll coil plummeted like $3.20 and that down cycle lasted for the fourth quarter into January. This most recent one, hot roll did come off, only down to about $4.20 and obviously it was almost an eight week dip. And I think that that foreshortening of that cycle and the lessening of the debt is a result of those trade cases in place. And it gives us confidence anyway that for some time to come we’re going to see a different pricing environment for our products, a much stronger pricing environment for our products. Michael Gambardella Thanks a lot, Mark. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Phil Gibbs of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gibbs Good morning. Mark Millett Good morning. Phil Gibbs Just had a question on the mix in sheet products in the quarter, and what that breakout was, Theresa. Theresa Wagler Phil, I’m so sorry – yes I have that for you. So for hot band and P&O it was 781,000 tons, cold roll was 112,000 tons, and coated was 673,000 tons for the total of 1.6 billion. Phil Gibbs Okay. And can you remind us how much lag there is in the sheet business in terms of how much business is direct spot versus quarterly or monthly indexes? Theresa Wagler Yes, so we’re still have right around that 40% to 45% that is contractual, Phil, and that is what I would put a lag on. The rest of it truly is spot business. Phil Gibbs Okay, I appreciate that. And the last one I have is on electricity and power rights. I know natural gas itself is not necessarily a big driver for you guys, but electricity is. Have we seen power rates move higher as call it the last 12 to 18 months have gone on with higher call it info cost minimum in oil and natural gas? Theresa Wagler Phil, it is nothing that would be significant enough for us to note. Phil Gibbs Okay. Thanks very much. Mark Millett And, Phil, if I may, and it maybe self evident and most of recognize it. But just for perhaps the newcomers on the call, when we talk about contract pricing at 40%, that’s volume driven and pricing is actually against index. So there is no fixed price contracts out there, just for clarity. Phil Gibbs Thanks, Mark. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jorge Beristain of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jorge Beristain Hey, good morning, Mark and Theresa. I had a question about the Columbus mill. Could you just recap again, you said the percentage of value added has increased from when you guys took it over, could you just give me those numbers again? Theresa Wagler Well when we actually purchased Columbus in 2014, over 60% of their shipments were what we would call more just straight hot band. And today, they are actually operating at almost full capacity on their galvanizing lines. And we just added a paint line which will add 250,000 tons of really our highest margin product throughout our flat roll operation, and that actually started. And so we expect to ramp that up throughout 2017 with new and existing customers. I would say today, if you look at that same percentage of just straight hot band, it is more in the area of 45% and we hope to get that even down lower. I think we could get it as low as 40% at some point in time. Jorge Beristain So would it be fair to say you’ve had about a 20 percentage point increase in value add? Theresa Wagler Yes. Absolutely. Jorge Beristain Okay. And then just on the energy exposure from Columbus. Because at the time you’d acquired it, energy was heading south at the time. What is the energy exposure there historically, and how much is it for your Firm overall and how quickly could you re-ramp up service to the energy sector if those pipelines come back on? Theresa Wagler So from an energy perspective, when we bought Columbus, they had a real strong concentration. It was probably at least 20% that was tied directly into that energy sector, and there’s nothing that they need to do to ramp up capacity it is just different products that they produce on existing equipment. So it is really about the customer base itself, and they have maintained great relationships with those energy customers. And so, Barry, you can jump in if you would like. But I don’t think it’s a matter of ramping it up, it is a matter of keeping a diversified customer base that they stay at high utilization rates. Barry Schneider Absolutely, Theresa. And I think one of the things that I would like to add is that we continually add new products, so we are able to make higher strike steels in wider widths which is what that sector requires. And we do have a capital project this year to upgrade a coiler to allow us to go heavier in gauge. Although a relatively small project, $10 million or so, we want to be able to go after the projects in that sector that make sense for us. So it is always going to be good sector, we just do not want to be 20% dependent on it. So we never want to leave it, we just want to make sure we are providing the best products to that sector as possible. Theresa Wagler And the other division that we have leverage related to energy really is in the engineered bar division, and that is what Mark spoke about earlier about the optimism that we see there. And the other thing I just don’t want to leave the call without talking about Columbus as far as a lever, it’s not just the diversification in customer base and product, which has been phenomenal. It is hard to describe the change from even 2015 to 2016 with Columbus, But they still have additional what I would say earnings capability, both regarded to the paint line and other products that they are developing there including in the automotive arena. But additionally, there’s still some cost benefits that I think can be realized as well in 2017 and 2018. So Columbus is not a fully told story in my mind. Jorge Beristain Great, thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Fields of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Fields Hello, everyone. Congrats again on the nice year. I just wanted to ask you, and I apologize if I missed this earlier in the call. But one of your competitors that’s been pretty active in the downstream space buying up some fabricators in their pipe and tube sector, would you consider looking at the space and maybe some of the either smaller or larger players that are available? Mark Millett I think we – I think it is better answered by – just saying we are obviously focused on growth, it remains our first priority from a cash allocation perspective. And we look at an array of opportunities. Matthew Fields When you say growth, is there one particular tilt that you’re preferring whether it is upstream or downstream or anything like that? Mark Millett I think we – as we have said in the past, two principal areas of focus. One is, as I mentioned, pull-through volume, downstream opportunities that will allow us to support our own mills in times sort of down cycle. That is one specific focus. The second is obviously we’re still makers first and foremost in downstream, so a higher-margin value-add type products is another focus for us. Matthew Fields And is there sort of a size that you’re focused on, or would you not be uncomfortable going to a $1 billion or $2 billion size acquisition? Theresa Wagler Matt, I think if you look at the capital structure today and you look at our net leverage and our credit metrics and the cash flow generation, we absolutely can do things that are sizable. But we can also do maybe several meaningful medium-sized transactions as well. So it’s really – we have got – we’re in a great spot to have optionality. Matthew Fields Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett I think on behalf of the team here, Russ, Barry, Chris, Glenn, and Tricia, and Theresa, we would like to thank you for your time today and for your support. And as importantly to our customers, we will continue to try and provide the greater value to you as the years go on. And to our employees, again, a reminder, safety is absolutely paramount for us. Nothing is more important to us, and so be safe out there and thanks for all you do. So thank you, everyone Operator Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s call.

I think the demand for our steel products continues. So I do not think we’re going to see the corrections we’ve seen over the last couple of years. I think there will be a mild retrenchment and we will go from there. Evan Kurtz And maybe just a… Mark Millett Just to kind of color that as to SDI specifically, a stable market sort of pricing environment should really aid the recycling profitability of OmniSource. The last two years, 2015 and 2016, you saw kind of prolonged downward trend in pricing. And when you’re working in kind of an inventory based by it one month sell it the next, it is tough to make the spread.

Our rig count is growing, energy pricing is going to be sustained we believe at that $50 or more, and we think on the flat roll sort of scalp side there is a lot less inventory or pipe or usable pipe than is anticipated. We are seeing significant pickup in order activity at Converse just the past four weeks. Their pipeline projects have taken off, and I think it is going to grow and surprise us all. So in general, we anticipate a positive flat roll market, sheet pricing we think will continue or should appreciate through the year, and the first-quarter volumes should pick up a little and margins expand. In long products, again as I said earlier, unlike sheet the overcapacity does persist, but we’re starting to see a market change in customer sentiment, and market dynamics turning very, very positive, I believe. Beams remain under pressure from overcapacity, but consumption should grow as non-residential continues to grow. Specific to SDI, I think the team has done a great job expanding the product portfolio and we will continue to do that with angles in 2017. That seeing fabricator – or the fabricators are reporting strong order inquiry and are building backlog. And again, there should be an infrastructure spend there. So I think structural arena has got some positive momentum. Class one rail, although CapEx for the class one’s has softened some, again, the team has been expanding the product range, getting into the high carbon grades and different sections and we think that the volumes will remain strong and flat through the year. And similarly, merchant shapes seems to be showing some signs of recovery with the fabricators having stronger backlogs and service centers restocking. But most significantly, and I think we’re excited, is a very strong rebound in engineered bar and SBQ. It has taken place probably in the last four to five weeks. But the team is probably more optimistic now than it has been in 2 or 3 years, and the customers are definitely in a markedly significant difference frame of mind. And they are starting to pull out there orders or pullout from their forecasts, and it is most noticeably in the oil patch. We’ve seen the tubers and the forages are significantly stronger than we have seen for a very long time. And I think we are even seeing a rebound in Caterpillar off-road. So we’re excited about that. So long products in general, we believe is – it’s going to see some good growth through the year. Evan Kurtz That’s helpful. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Korn of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Justin Kwan Hey, everyone. This is Justin filling in for Matt. Theresa Wagler Morning. Justin Kwan I was wondering, have you guys had a chance to interact with anyone from the new administration yet? And if you have, what have the talks been about? Mark Millett We have not. Justin Kwan Okay. Mark Millett Have we? Everyone is shaking their head no. Justin Kwan Okay. And then just one more. Did the potential for reopening NAFTA cause any complications with marketing plans with Columbus and the shipments to Mexico at all, or is there anything we’re missing on that? Mark Millett No, we are continuing to look at Mexico as a strong marketplace for us. There are a lot of existing assets in place there. You just have to travel through the industrial centers there. Consumption is massive, and we’re not looking for a large portion of that. We shipped 200,000 tons into Mexico last year, and the intent is to increase that to around about 400,000 tons. And I think we are confident that it’s going to happen. Again, I think with the new administration, you have got some very, very positive things that they reportedly want to do, tax reform, trade, some sensible regulation. The balance is going to be not to shut down trade with Mexico or Canada or – I guess we need flow going both ways across the borders. But we are going forward, but we are not planned. Justin Kwan Okay. Thanks, everybody. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tony Rizzuto of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Tony Rizzuto Thanks very much. Good morning, Mark, Theresa, and Russ. Just got a couple questions here if I maybe. The first one is, Mark, on your comments over the latent capacity that you have. Over what time period do you envision that you would be able to operate that more fully and be able to achieve that 1.5 million to 2 million tons? Mark Millett I think that it’s probably the second half of the year that we’ll ramp into that. We are going to see volume growth through – in the first half compared to the fourth quarter for sure. But from an infrastructure build, that will ramp up obviously. And you have two sectors there, you have the fast track where there’s numerous projects already kind of lined up and they will likely, and we’re starting to see them more I think, but they will likely come on in the second quarter. And then any infrastructure buildout from the new administration, that’s probably a second half and going into… Tony Rizzuto Okay. And then, if I may, just there’s a lot of things arguably about the new administration, which are very supportive to the steel demand and the steel industry in general. And maybe following up on the question about NAFTA, are there any other areas that worry you about any potential outcomes with new policy? What is most concerning to you potentially? Mark Millett Again, everything is speculative I think right now, Tony. I think they’ve come out with guns blazing and following up on the some of their promises. And I think tax reform, as I said, tax reform and sensible regulation will certainly help the country have a more positive business climate and boost the economy. And their position on trade, I think – we are already benefiting dramatically from the cases that were approved last year. They can only sort of vulcanize that environment. I think the sensitivities or the balance is trade and not getting into a trade war, and hopefully we have some sensible people advising that new administration and we won’t get that point. Tony Rizzuto Thanks, Mark. I appreciate that. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brett Levy of Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question. Brett Levy Hey, Mark, hey, Theresa. Is it on your plate at all to consider adding any assets in Mexico, and have you heard anything from competitors or, I don’t know, even substitute products that sort of thing, to add capacity to address the capacity that is already left for Mexico? Mark Millett I guess our strategy in Mexico currently, Brett, is commercial more than bricks and mortar. Brett Levy So continue to send stuff that way. I mean, is there any advantage to putting SBQ or any other form of capacity there as opposed to shipping it to them? Mark Millett We’re not looking at that I would suggest currently. They obviously are steel short. They import pretty much all oil products, but that is not something that we are considering right this second. Brett Levy All right. Thanks very much, guys. Operator Thank you. Our question is coming from Seth Rosenfeld of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Seth Rosenfeld Good morning. I have a couple questions on the outlook for the long steel market. Can you just comment about more on what you’re currently seeing for long steel import trends into the U.S.? In 2017, have you already seen some countries begin back out of the U.S. proactively following the law into the most recent rebar trade case? And can you give us a little bit of a sense of what level of confidence you have looking forward, both with regards to the Turkey trade case also including two other Asian peers? And also the Mexican tariff review, what impact could that have in the market various scenarios? Thank you. Glenn Pushis Good morning. This is Glenn Pushis. The rebar trade case, we are involved in it but we’re just not a real big player in that sector. At this point, we do maybe 50,000 or 60,000 tons in arguably about 9 million ton market here in North America. So it is really hard for me to answer any of those questions, Mark, with much distinct knowledge about that. Seth Rosenfeld Okay, thank you. I guess then looking the other areas of long steel where you’re more focused like SBQ. You commented very positive on the demand trends. Can you just talk about what headwinds you could see the market with regards to other local capacity domestically within the U.S., or if you could see the risk of imports once again coming in should those prices really start to pick up as you mentioned earlier? Mark Millett Again, our focus at Pittsboro is principally in engineered bar not in commercial commodity type SBQ. The import pressure comes in just 1-inch RAND 1045, 1018 commodity type materials. The team has done a phenomenal job down there building relationships with the Caterpillars and their automotive, the forches whereby it can take 2 or 3 years to get qualified for a certain application. Those cannot be substituted one month in one month out by imports. So I do not believe SBQ is dramatically impacted from – or at least our SBQ business, dramatically impacted from import pressure. Seth Rosenfeld Okay, thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Gambardella of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Gambardella Good morning and congratulations on another good quarter. Mark Millett Thank you, Mike. Michael Gambardella You’re welcome, Mark thanks. I was watching CNN on Tuesday, the second day that Trump was in the office, and noticed that the U.S. Steel’s CEO was standing there next to Trump smiling in the White House office. And I was just stunned over the last 35 years of following this industry to think that a steel executive would be invited into the White House the second day a president was in the office just shocked me. What do you think you can expect to get out of Washington on the trade front? Even I would say on the sheet side, even if they could strictly enforce the laws that are on the books right now would be a big positive for you and the rest of the players in the sheet market, and I’m really talking about the diversion that China is doing through Vietnam and other countries to evade the trade tariffs that they have in place. Because legally, you would think China wouldn’t be able to export a pound of sheet steel into the U.S. given the tariffs they have on hot roll, cold roll, and coated, recently. What are your expectations for strict enforcement of the trade laws that we have right now coming out of Washington? Mark Millett I think you actually likely answered your own question, Michael. I believe there will be vigorous enforcement of the anti-circumvention laws. If you consider the whack-a-mole we saw last year with Vietnam, I think Vietnam ended with 800,000 tons of the coated product coming in which is huge, huge volume. That, and as you know there is a case or intervention pending there and I think that will end positively. Certainly the rhetoric and the trade position that we’re seeing out of Washington right this second gives you a high likelihood or high probability that that will be successful. And that is very meaningful, certainly meaningful for us with the Galvalume product that has been coming in and the building product commodity prepayments coming in. Just the non-market subsidization, and I think a strong point will be just taking action on the currency manipulation by China. Michael Gambardella What other benefits could you see coming out of trade in terms of regulations that you – that may have been imposed on you guys over the last five, eight years? Mark Millett Well if you look in that timeframe, and I do not know whether you are implying or inferring like a section 201 type activity, again, it would just be speculative for us to talk about at this moment. Michael Gambardella Okay. All right. Thanks a lot and congratulations again, Mark. Mark Millett Thank you. Mike, just I guess one thought. Relative to the trade cases that we already have in place, because I think it’s illustrative to look at the downturn in Q4 of 2015 and the recent one in 2016. Both are relatively procurement driven. But you had in 2015, hot roll coil plummeted like $3.20 and that down cycle lasted for the fourth quarter into January. This most recent one, hot roll did come off, only down to about $4.20 and obviously it was almost an eight week dip. And I think that that foreshortening of that cycle and the lessening of the debt is a result of those trade cases in place. And it gives us confidence anyway that for some time to come we’re going to see a different pricing environment for our products, a much stronger pricing environment for our products. Michael Gambardella Thanks a lot, Mark. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Phil Gibbs of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gibbs Good morning. Mark Millett Good morning. Phil Gibbs Just had a question on the mix in sheet products in the quarter, and what that breakout was, Theresa. Theresa Wagler Phil, I’m so sorry – yes I have that for you. So for hot band and P&O it was 781,000 tons, cold roll was 112,000 tons, and coated was 673,000 tons for the total of 1.6 billion. Phil Gibbs Okay. And can you remind us how much lag there is in the sheet business in terms of how much business is direct spot versus quarterly or monthly indexes? Theresa Wagler Yes, so we’re still have right around that 40% to 45% that is contractual, Phil, and that is what I would put a lag on. The rest of it truly is spot business. Phil Gibbs Okay, I appreciate that. And the last one I have is on electricity and power rights. I know natural gas itself is not necessarily a big driver for you guys, but electricity is. Have we seen power rates move higher as call it the last 12 to 18 months have gone on with higher call it info cost minimum in oil and natural gas? Theresa Wagler Phil, it is nothing that would be significant enough for us to note. Phil Gibbs Okay. Thanks very much. Mark Millett And, Phil, if I may, and it maybe self evident and most of recognize it. But just for perhaps the newcomers on the call, when we talk about contract pricing at 40%, that’s volume driven and pricing is actually against index. So there is no fixed price contracts out there, just for clarity. Phil Gibbs Thanks, Mark. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jorge Beristain of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jorge Beristain Hey, good morning, Mark and Theresa. I had a question about the Columbus mill. Could you just recap again, you said the percentage of value added has increased from when you guys took it over, could you just give me those numbers again? Theresa Wagler Well when we actually purchased Columbus in 2014, over 60% of their shipments were what we would call more just straight hot band. And today, they are actually operating at almost full capacity on their galvanizing lines. And we just added a paint line which will add 250,000 tons of really our highest margin product throughout our flat roll operation, and that actually started. And so we expect to ramp that up throughout 2017 with new and existing customers. I would say today, if you look at that same percentage of just straight hot band, it is more in the area of 45% and we hope to get that even down lower. I think we could get it as low as 40% at some point in time. Jorge Beristain So would it be fair to say you’ve had about a 20 percentage point increase in value add? Theresa Wagler Yes. Absolutely. Jorge Beristain Okay. And then just on the energy exposure from Columbus. Because at the time you’d acquired it, energy was heading south at the time. What is the energy exposure there historically, and how much is it for your Firm overall and how quickly could you re-ramp up service to the energy sector if those pipelines come back on? Theresa Wagler So from an energy perspective, when we bought Columbus, they had a real strong concentration. It was probably at least 20% that was tied directly into that energy sector, and there’s nothing that they need to do to ramp up capacity it is just different products that they produce on existing equipment. So it is really about the customer base itself, and they have maintained great relationships with those energy customers. And so, Barry, you can jump in if you would like. But I don’t think it’s a matter of ramping it up, it is a matter of keeping a diversified customer base that they stay at high utilization rates. Barry Schneider Absolutely, Theresa. And I think one of the things that I would like to add is that we continually add new products, so we are able to make higher strike steels in wider widths which is what that sector requires. And we do have a capital project this year to upgrade a coiler to allow us to go heavier in gauge. Although a relatively small project, $10 million or so, we want to be able to go after the projects in that sector that make sense for us. So it is always going to be good sector, we just do not want to be 20% dependent on it. So we never want to leave it, we just want to make sure we are providing the best products to that sector as possible. Theresa Wagler And the other division that we have leverage related to energy really is in the engineered bar division, and that is what Mark spoke about earlier about the optimism that we see there. And the other thing I just don’t want to leave the call without talking about Columbus as far as a lever, it’s not just the diversification in customer base and product, which has been phenomenal. It is hard to describe the change from even 2015 to 2016 with Columbus, But they still have additional what I would say earnings capability, both regarded to the paint line and other products that they are developing there including in the automotive arena. But additionally, there’s still some cost benefits that I think can be realized as well in 2017 and 2018. So Columbus is not a fully told story in my mind. Jorge Beristain Great, thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Fields of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Fields Hello, everyone. Congrats again on the nice year. I just wanted to ask you, and I apologize if I missed this earlier in the call. But one of your competitors that’s been pretty active in the downstream space buying up some fabricators in their pipe and tube sector, would you consider looking at the space and maybe some of the either smaller or larger players that are available? Mark Millett I think we – I think it is better answered by – just saying we are obviously focused on growth, it remains our first priority from a cash allocation perspective. And we look at an array of opportunities. Matthew Fields When you say growth, is there one particular tilt that you’re preferring whether it is upstream or downstream or anything like that? Mark Millett I think we – as we have said in the past, two principal areas of focus. One is, as I mentioned, pull-through volume, downstream opportunities that will allow us to support our own mills in times sort of down cycle. That is one specific focus. The second is obviously we’re still makers first and foremost in downstream, so a higher-margin value-add type products is another focus for us. Matthew Fields And is there sort of a size that you’re focused on, or would you not be uncomfortable going to a $1 billion or $2 billion size acquisition? Theresa Wagler Matt, I think if you look at the capital structure today and you look at our net leverage and our credit metrics and the cash flow generation, we absolutely can do things that are sizable. But we can also do maybe several meaningful medium-sized transactions as well. So it’s really – we have got – we’re in a great spot to have optionality. Matthew Fields Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett I think on behalf of the team here, Russ, Barry, Chris, Glenn, and Tricia, and Theresa, we would like to thank you for your time today and for your support. And as importantly to our customers, we will continue to try and provide the greater value to you as the years go on. And to our employees, again, a reminder, safety is absolutely paramount for us. Nothing is more important to us, and so be safe out there and thanks for all you do. So thank you, everyone Operator Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s call.

And now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Mark Siegel for some opening remarks. Mark? Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks, Mike. Good morning and welcome to Patterson-UTI's conference call for the first quarter of 2017. We are pleased that you're able to join us today. As is customary, I will start by briefly reviewing the financial results for the quarter ended March 31, before turning the call over to Andy Hendricks, who will share some comments on our operational highlights as well as our outlook. After Andy's comments, I will provide some closing remarks before turning the call over for questions. I'd like to start by saying how pleased I am with the recent completion of the merger with Seventy Seven Energy. I welcome all of the Seventy Seven employees and shareholders to Patterson-UTI. As we turn to the financial results for the first quarter, I want to remind you that because the merger just closed last week, all reported financial results for the first quarter are for Patterson-UTI on a stand-alone basis. As set forth in our earnings press release issued this morning, for the first quarter we reported a net loss of $63.5 million or $0.40 per share on revenues of $305 million. Total adjusted EBITDA during the first quarter was $63.6 million. I would like to note the financial results for the first quarter include a pre-tax gain of $11.2 million or $0.04 per share after-tax related to a real estate sale, and transaction expenses related to the merger with Seventy Seven Energy of $5.2 million pre-tax or $0.02 per share after-tax. Turning now to the merger with Seventy Seven Energy. For Patterson-UTI, the merger with Seventy Seven Energy was the most significant transaction since the merger of Patterson and UTI in 2001. Strategically, this merger strengthens our position in both U.S. onshore drilling and pressure pumping. In drilling, with the combined rig fleet of approximately 200 high-spec rigs, this transaction has further solidified our position as a leader in this industry. The Seventy Seven rig fleet is very complementary to our own and the combination of our rig fleets expands our ability to meet the strong demand for super-spec rigs. We believe a lot of U.S. onshore drilling activity would not have been economic three years ago at current commodity prices. But, in this market, we believe that drilling economics are positively affected by the efficiencies offered by super-spec rigs. In pressure pumping, the Seventy Seven Energy merger increased our frac fleet by approximately 0.5 million horsepower to approximately 1.5 million horsepower and expanded our geographic footprint to the Mid-Continent region. With the efficiencies necessary to make wells economic under current commodity prices, well costs on a per-unit-of-production basis are being reduced in part by the increased production that may result from higher intensity completions with greater volumes of sand being pumped. For pressure pumping companies, the greater volumes of sand are creating operational and logistical challenges and straining supply chains. Our increased scale following this merger provides us with even greater efficiencies in procuring items such as sand, chemicals and maintenance spares. Additionally, our increased size should help address the challenges of transporting increased volumes of sand by rail and truck to the well. The Seventy Seven merger also provides us with a new business line to the addition of Great Plains Oilfield Rental. We will be able to leverage the Patterson-UTI footprint and infrastructure to expand their operations. We are excited about this opportunity as we believe this business has tremendous room for growth. We'd like to take a moment to commend Seventy Seven Energy for their significant accomplishments in emerging from Chesapeake and expanding their customer base. We look forward to continuing to work for these customers. In both drilling and pressure pumping, we see great opportunities to leverage the larger-scale customer base and geographic footprint of the combined company. With the acquisition of Seventy Seven Energy, we issued approximately 47.5 million shares of common stock. Concurrent with the closing of the merger, we repaid all of the outstanding debt of Seventy Seven Energy, which totaled $472 million on a gross basis or $403 million net of cash received from Seventy Seven Energy. Our balance sheet remains strong. After this transaction, we estimate our debt-to-total-capitalization at approximately 15%, which affords ample flexibility. We have recently increased our revolving credit facility to $632 million through September of 2017 and to $490 million through March of 2019. With our financial strength and increased scale, I am excited about how Patterson-UTI is positioned in the current market. As a leader in both high-spec drilling and pressure pumping, we are uniquely positioned to benefit from increasing demand for drilling and completing oil and gas wells. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks, Mark. In contract drilling, rig demand was strong during the first quarter, driving a 22% increase in our U.S. rig count to an average of 81 rigs for the first quarter from 66 rigs in the fourth quarter. Rig demand remains robust and, as such, we expect to average 96 rigs in the U.S. for the month of April, excluding the contribution to the rig count from Seventy Seven Energy. From the Seventy Seven rig fleet, 58 rigs are currently operating and, therefore, including the contribution from these rigs post merger, we expect our rig count in U.S. to average 115 rigs in April. In Canada, our rig count averaged two rigs for the first quarter, unchanged from the fourth quarter. Both of these rigs have been engaged in pad drilling operations, which allow them to stay active after the onset of the breakup period in Canada. Accordingly, we expect to average two rigs in Canada for the month of April. The growth in our rig count in contract explorations during the first quarter reduced the proportion of our rigs under higher day-rate term contracts, causing total average rig revenue per day for the first quarter to decrease $440 to $21,200. Total average rig operating cost for the first quarter increased to $14,450 from $13,770 for the first quarter as the result of a lower proportion of rigs on standby and an increase in rig re-activation expenses. Total average rig margin per day decreased to $6,750 for the first quarter from $7,870 for the fourth quarter. At March 31, we had term contracts for drilling rigs providing for approximately $385 million of future day-rate drilling revenue. Based on contracts currently in place and including the post-merger contribution from the Seventy Seven rig fleet, we expect an average of 84 rigs operating under term contracts during the second quarter and an average of 61 rigs operating under term contracts during the 12-month period ending March 31, 2018. Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter. As a reminder, by virtue of the merger with Seventy Seven Energy, many operational aspects are not easily comparable to actual first quarter results. The proportion of rigs on higher day-rate term contracts, the mix between different rig classes and the proportion of rigs on standby are some of the factors that affect average revenue and cost per day. Additionally, the Seventy Seven Energy rig fleet is currently operating at lower revenue and margins per day. One of the great opportunities with this merger is to leverage Patterson-UTI's greater geographic footprint, customer base and support efficiencies to improve the margin contribution. In terms of rig activity, we expect our rig count will continue to increase during the second quarter. Including the post-merger contribution from the Seventy Seven rig fleet, we expect our rig count in the U.S. will average 143 rigs, and our rig count in Canada will average 1 rig. Average rig revenue per day is expected to be $19,900 during the second quarter and average margin per day is expected to be $6,000. Turning to our rig fleet. We completed construction of the previously-announced APEX-XK earlier this month, bringing our APEX-XK rig fleet to 57 rigs and our total APEX fleet before the merger with Seventy Seven to 162 rigs. We are still in the process of completing the construction of the previously-announced APEX-XC, the first of this new APEX rig class. This new design is the next step in the evolution of our original APEX 300 series WALKING rig and is complementary to our fast-moving APEX-XK. The APEX-XC offers a pad-optimal design with greater clearance for walking over and around wellheads on a pad, larger drill pipe racking capacity for efficiently drilling longer laterals, and it will feature a higher torque top drive from Warrior, our rig technology company. This new APEX-XC is expected to be delivered in the second half of this year. As part of the integration of Seventy Seven Energy into Patterson-UTI, we considered 36 of their rigs to be APEX-class rigs. We believe these rigs are very complementary to our APEX rigs, as most of the components of these rigs are similar to the components used across the APEX rig fleet. Including the rigs from Seventy Seven Energy fleet, our APEX-class rig fleet currently totals 198 rigs. Going forward, we now have 100 super-spec rigs in our fleet, which makes us a leader in this market where demand for highly efficient rigs has proven to be the strongest. All but three of our super-spec rigs are currently contracted with two idle rigs located at Appalachia and one in the Bakken. Across the industry, we estimate that total supply of super-spec rigs is approximately 425 in the entire U.S., with utilization for this class of rig exceeding 90%. Where justified, we will continue to upgrade rigs in our fleet to meet customer demand for super-spec rigs. Turning now to pressure pumping. Pressure pumping revenues increased a stronger-than-expected 34% sequentially to $141 million in the first quarter from $106 million in the fourth quarter. Pressure pumping gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 15.7% for the first quarter from 5.3% in the fourth quarter due to higher pricing and greater fixed cost coverage due to the increased activity from reactivated spreads. Since mid-December, we have reactivated four spreads, including two spreads that were reactivated earlier this month and therefore did not generate any revenues in the first quarter. We expect further opportunities to reactivate additional horsepower in the back half of 2017. As a result of the merger with Seventy Seven Energy, our fleet has grown to approximately 1.5 million frac horsepower, of which approximately 70% is currently active. Over 90% of our frac revenues are generated from spreads on 24-hour operations. We also have approximately 86,000 horsepower used for cement, acid or nitrogen services. The merger with Seventy Seven Energy expanded our geographic footprint in pressure pumping to include the Mid-Continent. Currently, we have approximately 850,000 frac horsepower in Texas, 350,000 frac horsepower in Appalachia and 300,000 frac horsepower in Mid-Continent. With approximately 1.5 million horsepower in only three regions, we maintain considerable local scale for strong regional efficiencies. In hydraulic fracturing, procurement and logistics of sand and chemicals, and the ability to be efficient and control costs are some of the keys to being successful. And the addition of Seventy Seven Energy adds more sand terminals to our overall pressure pumping business. We have worked with various sand producers to improve our contract position where we have access to higher volumes of the more popular sand-mesh sizes. We expect that sand supply for the finer mesh sizes will be tight for the industry until incremental production is brought online later this year and in 2018. We are comfortable with our own contracted position for sand supplies in terms of both pricing and access to sand, as we have contracts covering the majority of our expected sand demand. As well, and in a separate but related logistics optimization initiative, in mid-2016 we began the planning process to transition from regional PRESSURE PUMPING logistics to a centralized logistics center in Houston that combined 24/7 dispatch personnel, central scheduling and tracking software, and smartphone apps in the field. We went live with the first frac spread back in November, and by the end of the first quarter of 2017, the central logistics team was supporting all of our active frac spreads in Texas. We intend to utilize the new 24/7 central logistics center to support all of our pressure pumping operations in order to improve our logistical efficiency and better manage our transportation and demurrage costs. Looking forward, including the post-merger contribution from Seventy Seven Energy, we expect pressure pumping revenues during the second quarter of approximately $275 million, as activity and pricing continues to improve. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues is expected to be similar to the first quarter. Gross margin percentage on Patterson-UTI's pre-merger asset base is expected to improve, but this margin growth is expected to be largely offset by lower margins at Seventy Seven Energy. Similar to drilling, we expect to garner better margins going forward by leveraging our larger scale, our geographic footprint and our combined diverse customer base. Before I turn the call back to Mark for his concluding remarks, let me provide an update on several other financial matters. Our other operations include our E&P business, Warrior and now Great Plains Oilfield Rentals. For the second quarter, we expect other operations to generate revenues of approximately $18 million with a gross margin as a percentage of revenues in the mid-20s. Subject to final purchase accounting adjustments, depreciation expense for the second quarter is expected to be approximately $190 million, including the post-merger contribution from Seventy Seven Energy. Similarly, including the post-merger contribution from Seventy Seven Energy, SG&A for the second quarter is expected to be $28 million. We are currently projecting our effective tax rate to be approximately 36% for the second quarter. Including the post-merger capital needs for the Seventy Seven Energy business, CapEx for the full-year 2017 is now expected to be $450 million, consisting of approximately $60 million of carryover spend. Excluding this carryover spend, CapEx includes $145 million for rig upgrades and new builds, $115 million for rig activations and maintenance, $105 million for pressure pumping fleet activation and maintenance, and $25 million for E&P, Warrior, Great Plains and other general corporate CapEx. With that, I will now turn the call back to Mark for his concluding remarks. Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks, Andy. The completion of the Seventy Seven Energy merger further solidifies our position as the leader in both land drilling and pressure pumping in the U.S., the two primary services needed for drilling and completing unconventional oil and gas wells. Our increased scale and market capitalization, along with our strong balance sheet, position us better than ever before to succeed in an expanding energy services market. I'd like to take a minute and welcome the people from Seventy Seven Energy into the Patterson-UTI family. We have always held the highly-skilled employees at Seventy Seven Energy in high regard. They share a devotion to the same core values of safety and customer service that are cornerstones to the Patterson-UTI culture. The merger integration process has begun, and I am pleased with the integration plan that we and Seventy Seven Energy have developed. We believe this collaborative plan will help maximize the value of the combined entity. With the closing of this merger, I am excited about the opportunities ahead. We believe that many of the plans for future drilling and pressure pumping activity have already been made, and E&P companies have hedged future production. Absent an event that causes crude oil prices to fall into the low-40s, we expect pricing and activity will continue to improve. With that, I'd like to both commend and thank the hardworking men and women who make up this company. We appreciate your continuing efforts. Also I'm pleased to announce today that the company declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of $0.02 per share to be paid on June 22, 2017 to holders of record as of June 8, 2017. Operator, we'd now like to open the call to questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Good morning, Sean. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC Let me start with pressure pumping. Andy, I was just curious to think about – you talked about the potential to reactivate more spreads in the second half. How do we think about the levers and timing that will guide those decisions? And then just thinking about a part of that calculus, are you getting net margin improvement beyond cost recovery at this stage? And how does that factor into those decisions? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Yeah. I guess to start with, let me just talk about the margin. I think certainly part of the margin expansion you saw in our first quarter results include net pricing increases that we were able to get towards the end of the quarter, and we see the potential for this to continue as well. In terms of reactivation, we have about 30% of our total 1.5 million horsepower that's stacked right now. And we see opportunity to activate that equipment in the second half, at various points in the second half, starting with one crew early in the third quarter. Outside of that, we're going to move basically with the market demand on activity. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And then just drilling side, I was just curious if you could give us a sense of the magnitude of how much of a day-rate premium you're able to get for an upgraded super-spec rig, compared to just a high-spec AC rig that's in the market, or even a relatively newer well-equipped SCR rig? Just trying to get a sense of the delta between those two in the market. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Well, in some ways, they're not exactly related because the high-spec rig market is just moving in a different pace and that's what we see in the majority of the demand. And we've seen pricing continuing to move up on high-spec/super-spec rigs through the first quarter, and as rig count continues to go up, pricing on those rigs continues to go up. We do see that over time that, because the high-spec/super-spec category pricing is moving up, that it lifts the SCR pricing at the same time. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. So your expectation would be that as high-spec rigs go, SCR kind of has to go with it or else there's some kind of – at some point, that gap gets wider as a substitution effect, so you need to see movement on the SCR rigs as well. Is that the right way to think about it? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. No, it's not a substitution. These are different markets. But the high-spec rig market lifts the SCR market. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, sir. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Marshall Adkins with Raymond James. Your line is open. J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Morning, guys. It sounds like the Seventy Seven, both rig and pressure pumping fleets, are being priced lower and it sounds like you have confidence you can get them up. So, to drill down on that issue, were they being priced lower because they're lower in quality or were they just trying to maintain a higher utilization and to do that they needed a price lower? Help me understand why you're confident you're going to get pricing and margins from that side of the business up. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. First off, let's clarify. Seventy Seven Energy has a great team with great assets and they run great quality operations. But Seventy Seven had a special challenge in that they had to expand their market base from a single customer base to multiple customers, and we applaud what they've done. We think they've done a tremendous job. But that had some challenges at the same time. In the timing of us merging the two companies together, it's just the net difference in the results of the margins that you see today. But both the market and then the improvements in the market and then the combination of the merger with Patterson-UTI and Seventy Seven together improves our overall geographic footprint, it improves our overall combined customer base, and so we see good potential there. J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Some of your competitors, as they've reactivated equipment both on the rig and the pressure pumping side, have really been dinged on margins. So far, you guys seem – your margins have ramped up really nicely with activity. It seems like you're passing on more of the sand and logistics cost that maybe some others are. So help me walk through going forward, as you reactivate more of this equipment, should we worry about maybe delayed margin improvement as you reactivate them? Or do you think you can stay ahead of that? And same question on the sand and last-mile logistics pass-throughs. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. So, in terms of the products, whether it's sand or chemicals, I think that our supply chain team has done a great job in managing the contracts that we have with our various suppliers across the U.S. And we have a number of different contracts in place that are layered, that expire at different points during the year. And what you saw between Q4 and Q1, the net result is very little movement in our average sand cost. And any movement that we had, we were able to pass that through. Combined with some net pricing improvements towards the end of Q1 gave us the margin expansion that we saw in pressure pumping. We do think that the market is tight on some of the finer mesh sizes, but we do also think that we're very comfortable with our contract position. And even though we might see some single-digit price increases on average going from Q1 to Q2, we have that factored into the projected margins as well. In terms of reactivation costs for pressure pumping spreads, the earlier fleets that we reactivated were costing us on average about $2 million per spread. We see this average going forward to be about $3 million to $4 million per spread, and that's really a cash cost that includes the labor. So, as you know, for 24-hour operations, it's at least 100 people that are coming on in a 60- to 90-day period before we even generate revenue. So we will see those costs in front of the revenue stream from each of those frac spreads as we continue to reactivate spreads going forward in 2017. J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. All right. Great. So the margin guidance at flattish with improving activity, you mentioned it's because you're rolling in the lower-margin Seventy Seven stuff. Is part of that lower margin guidance that your reactivation costs are going to go up? Or is it just more of the Seventy Seven stuff rolling in, and then over time that gets back up to where you are? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. It's a combination. I wouldn't say that it's reactivation costs going up necessarily, but more reactivation costs included in that future cost base as we reactivate spreads. J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Right. All right. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Operator Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Alexander D. Nuta - Evercore ISI Hey. How are you? This is Alex on for James. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Morning. Alexander D. Nuta - Evercore ISI My first question is on the Seventy Seven drilling assets. During the merger call, you guys didn't really highlight the SCR rigs. The 58 rigs operating would seem to indicate they received pretty good traction in the interim. Have you guys been surprised about those and where do you see that segment fitting in to your broader fleet? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. So we haven't been surprised on our side in terms of their utilization on their SCR fleet. You got to remember that Seventy Seven Energy has some of the newest SCR rigs that are out there in the market today and these are very competitive rigs. So, in some cases, their SCR rigs are going to have some of the same performance in some bases as some of the high-spec rigs that are out there as well, just because they're relatively new SCR rigs. So we're certainly pleased with the performance of their rig count overall. And we expect the SCR utilization to continue and improve with rig count overall, but it's also customer-specific. You've got certain customers that are out there and all they want to see is a high-spec or super-spec rig. But we do have customers that are out there using SCR rigs and very pleased with the utilization that Seventy Seven had on the SCR fleet. Alexander D. Nuta - Evercore ISI Understood. And then my second question kind of similar to Marshall, I guess how much – in the second quarter pressure pumping guidance, how much of that is net pricing increases versus the dilution? And I guess my question becomes – it sounds like 2Q becomes transitory and then we see some of the benefits in 3Q. Is that fair? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I think it's fair to say that you've got a combination of several things happening. You have the combination of the merger of the two companies and the net margin result there. You've also got activation costs for further frac spreads from a labor component where you have labor on-boarding before we generate revenue. And there's just various moving parts in there. And that's kind of what's happening in the second quarter. Even though we might see some increases in the sand cost in the single-digit percentile for the finer meshes, we believe that we have that covered in the margin as well. Alexander D. Nuta - Evercore ISI Understood. Thank you. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question is from the line of Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Good morning, guys. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Hey, Jim. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) The pressure pumping business was nothing short of amazing. The number of jobs was down to 14% and the average margin per job blew away our expectations. And I realize that may just be our problem with expectations. But can you talk about how – I mean was it – I understand prices at the end of the quarter, but this is for the whole quarter. Can you talk to me about how you did such a good job, I guess is what I'm asking? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Well, I have to give the credit to the teams in the field. I mean, our teams are really good at solid execution, running lean operations but still delivering high service quality at the same time. And because of that, we were able to push some pricing during the quarter and get some net pricing adds and continue to deliver service quality and improve operational efficiency and improve stages per day with some customers. So I have to give credit to the teams. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Well, margin per job of $58,000 versus $16,000 in Q4, that looks like a whole lot more than price. And I appreciate you all's execution. You all had the best margins longer coming into the down cycle than anybody else. That was just surprising to me, so. Okay. And going forward, you talk about how you've got your sand contracted. Do you make money on sand? And how much of your revenues in pressure pumping was the pass-through of sand? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. So we do have a small margin on sand. The interesting thing is it's a smaller margin than the service. So, if we're pumping more sand in a given month or a given quarter then it becomes dilutive to the margin. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Right. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. And it does vary from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter, but we do make a small margin on sand. But I believe as activity continues to increase during 2017 following the macro on increasing rig count, then these net pricings increases that we've seen on services also move into the small margin that we get on the products as well over time. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Okay. And last, if I could, congratulations on Seventy Seven. I think that's an excellent acquisition. You've got a 15% debt to cap. Are you through? Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Jim, we're never through. We're always looking for good opportunities, Jim, so. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Okay. But it took you a long time to do this one. So do we have to wait this long to do the next one? Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Jim, my crystal ball is a little fuzzy on how long it takes for the next deal. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Okay. I mean, you don't want the market to run away from you before you have the chance though, right? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Well, I think the interesting thing in this market is I don't think you have to rush and I think the market can still have opportunities over the next couple of years. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Okay, guys. Thanks so much. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC Hey. Actually that was pretty good. That last name, pretty good. So I guess let's talk about your guidance. Trying to put the pieces together. Can you just confirm that your guidance implies about $100 million of EBITDA in 2Q? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Don't have that in front of me for the overall combined EBITDA of all the different companies. Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. All right. I'll just follow up after the call just to make sure we have all the moving pieces right. I guess I also wanted to chat about the contracts for SSE on the pumping side and on the land rig side with Chesapeake. So could you talk to that? When those roll off on the rig side and the pumping side? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I think the best way to describe it is with the combined businesses with Patterson-UTI plus Seventy Seven Energy on the drilling side, we don't have any situation with contracts that produces any headwind other than ongoing long-term contracts. What's happening in the margins in the drilling business, and I'm talking about the combined new business, is for rigs that are moving out we see improving margins. We have some contracts that we've had for a while. As those roll off, those are going to roll closer to a spot at the lower margins. So we have several moving pieces there. And then combining the two entities together, you get the net result of the margin projection that we gave you for the second quarter. In pressure pumping, in terms of contracts what we see is it's really about two-thirds of our active fleets have the ability to move the pricing with the market. Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. All right. And so we can have the right run rate as we get into 3Q, could you just help us with what the underlying rig count assumption is for SSE in 2Q because we don't have a full quarter there, and then the same for the revenue side on pressure pumping? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. It really gets back to the averages that we gave you. We expect that the rig count is going to continue to increase during the second quarter. And including both Seventy Seven's fleets and Patterson-UTI's fleet, we expect the rig count in the U.S. will average 143 in the second quarter. Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. So what does that assume that – so if we think of legacy PTEN, how much is that assumed to be up in 2Q? That'll help us. 20% William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Yeah. We're moving on to combined company numbers now. Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC Well, I know, but the thing is – so let me ask you, so 143 rigs, is that a pro forma for 90 days for SSE? Or is that a pro forma for 70 days? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. That's a function as of the close on April 20. Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC Right. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. (38:14) Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC I can follow up afterwards, but basically I'm trying to understand – I want to understand what SSE is, the run rate, going into 3Q. We just don't have a full quarter. I'll follow up after the call. Thank you. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question is from Brad Handler with Jefferies. Your line is open. Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC Thanks, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking my call. If my question is redundant, I apologize. I had to hop off for just a couple of minutes. But can we talk first about drilling operating expenses? So, obviously, you've given us the margin guidance on the second quarter, so it's $13,900 a day. That I get. Obviously, there was also some volatility, some fluctuation as standby rigs came off and then you also have a little bit of sort of the reactivation cost of bringing rigs back into service I guess. How can we think about that maybe in 3Q? Where should we think about operating expenses a little bit longer-term just settling out for you, please? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Without going into the details of 3Q, I think it's safe to say that we're getting closer to the bottom in margins. But we still, as I mentioned earlier and it's no problem to repeat, as I mentioned earlier, we have some moving pieces here because we have a mix of contracts that we've had for a while now that are rolling off and moving closer to spot. We have rigs going out that are increasing in margin as they go out. And then we have the combination of the merger. We also have rig reactivations where we have labor costs in front of the revenue of the rig. So there's moving pieces in there, but we're getting close to the bottom in the margins. Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC Okay. That's certainly good to hear. And I guess I was just trying to parse it on operating expenses, per se. And so, if I remove the rig reactivation element of that, maybe it's a combined – so it's a combined fleet question of course, but where do you think daily OpEx sort of settles out? John E. Vollmer - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. We think it's similar on a per day basis. We don't really pull the rig reactivation costs out of that. So per day would be similar. Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC So it will wind up staying similar to where you're talking about for Q2? John E. Vollmer - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Correct. Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC Is that what you mean to suggest? Okay. Got it. John E. Vollmer - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Yes. Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC Okay. And then I guess maybe just a quick follow-up for me just on that last answer to one of Chase's questions. So, in other words, do you have contract commitments and therefore fixed pricing on roughly a third of the pro forma pressure pumping fleet? Is that the – just want to make sure I'm interpreting what you said correctly. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Yeah. And let me say it this way. So, two-thirds of our active fleet has the ability to move with pricing and the one-third that's under either some kind of contract or pricing agreement doesn't extend very long through the year. I would say that the majority of that rolls off before the end of 2017, if that helps. Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC It does. It does. Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll turn it back. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question is from the line of (41:34).Your line is open. Our next question is going to be from Michael Lamotte with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC Hey. Good morning, guys. Andy, I know there's a lot of moving pieces and I want to sort of get back to the structural cost differences between Patterson and Seventy Seven. And maybe if we look at first quarter as the baseline and you look at the difference in margin in the two businesses, how much of that difference would you say is contract and pricing-related versus cost structure? I mean, is it a 30%-70% split, 50%-50%? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I think there's a mix of both, without getting into the details. Patterson-UTI is a larger enterprise than Seventy Seven was in the first quarter. So we had a little bit more efficiency in the supporting costs side. There's also an element of pricing on the Seventy Seven side as they expanded their customer base and did a great job doing that. But it's really about the go-forward and we feel like we're in a good position for the combined entities moving forward through the year. Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC Well, that's actually what I was trying to get at is sort of thinking about the speed with which sort of normalized margins – you could begin to normalize those Seventy Seven margins to the Patterson level and what the frictional elements are to that? I mean, you mentioned on the answer to Marshall's question that moving from single to multiple customers is sort of frictional. But is there anything other than that dynamic that slows this margin progression down or uplift slows it down? Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Michael, I just would observe that we closed the merger exactly one week ago. And at this point, we're still getting our arms around all the details of their operations. And so, giving an exact prediction as to when their margins increase and get to the same level as the Patterson margins, pretty difficult for us to give a good fix on that at this moment a week later. Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC Fair enough. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. But I will reiterate... Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC I'll follow up with you next week. Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks for that. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I will reiterate that second quarter margins are nearing the bottom for us. Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC Okay. And then, Andy, on the 90% utilization for super-specs, as we start reactivating rigs sort of further in the stack, are they geographically in the right markets? Are we, within a quarter or two, going to start to see rigs needing to move? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I think in some cases we'll have some rigs moved. I think that when we do move rigs, we get support in the contract from customers to help offset the costs to move those rigs. And in our particular case, we have the opportunity to continue to do some upgrades. I went through the list of items in the total CapEx. One of the pieces that's interesting there, if you go back to what we said on the last call, in terms of rig upgrades and new builds at the last call, we said we had earmarked $115 million in the CapEx budget. Now we're at $145 million in the CapEx budget. And we're certainly happy with the pricing levels we're getting on the projections for what the payback is on those upgrades. Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC Yeah. It's still looking at less than a year, payback? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I wouldn't say it's less than a year but it's in that two- to three-year range... Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC Okay. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. ...on that upgrade component. Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC And then last one for me. In light of the OneStim joint venture, now having two competitors with roughly 3 million horsepower in capacity, does it change the thinking on scale in the frac business? It wasn't that long ago that we thought 1 million horsepower was sufficient scale and now you guys are at 1.5 million horsepower and scale just seems to be moving. How do you think about it? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. In general, I think that scale still matters in this business, especially because of everything that happens before you even get to the well side. But I think it's important – when you look at Patterson-UTI and now the combined merger of Patterson-UTI and Seventy Seven Energy and our footprint, we're a 1.5 million horsepower. So we're not as big as the two that you mentioned, but we're not in all the basins that they're in either. So our focus is with the primary aspect of our horsepower, 850,000 horsepower is in Texas. And we're also in the Mid-Continent and we're also in Appalachia. So, if you look at our concentration in the regions that we're working, we think we're in great shape. Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC Great. Thanks, guys. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question is from the line of Ken Sill with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open. Ken Sill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thank you. Surprised to get in here. So one of the questions, you were talking about the costs for reactivating a frac fleet, and saying that you're hiring an average of 100 people per crew. I'm assuming that's for 24-hour operations. That just seemed a little bit high to me. How many people do you guys run in an average crew? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. The average pressure pumping crew that's working 24-hour operations for us has 100 to 110 people on it. We generate over 90% of our revenues, of our total active fleet, from 24-hour operations. So, when we do these reactivations, we're going to have labor costs as we bring on people before we start generating revenue from a particular frac spread. And that labor cost can start 90 days before we generate revenue. And that labor cost grows over that 90-day period before we generate that revenue. Ken Sill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. I was just surprised by the head count. So, that kind of leads to a second question, which is, are you guys seeing an evolution in the size of the average frac spread you're putting out? What's the average spread, particularly in Texas, in terms of hydraulic horsepower today versus what would it have been a couple years ago? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Yeah. We've seen somewhat growth in the amount of horsepower that we put out. Some of it has to do with just changes in the operating pressures in where we're fracking these days versus where we may have fracked historically. So we previously might have lifted a frac spread at a 40,000 to 45,000 horsepower and today, depending on where it is in the U.S., it might be 45,000 to 50,000 horsepower. Ken Sill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. And final question, just trying to figure out what capacity could be out there, I mean what you can do with the fleet. Given you got longer laterals and higher sand loadings, you're solving that issue with more horsepower. Does it take more time to pump a bigger sand load? Or is that just a function of – I mean, there's a lot of moving pieces, but just on average does it take more time to pump a bigger sand loading per stage? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Certainly when you compare a horizontal well today versus what we were drilling two years ago on average in Texas, with longer laterals and higher volumes, we are pumping more time. But what that means for the industry in general, if you look at the total number of wells that have to be completed during the year, it takes more time to pump on that aggregate number of wells, which means more frac crews operating than historically in the past for the same number of wells. Ken Sill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Yeah. Well, actually and that leads to another question and then I'll stop. With the rigs getting more efficient, is the ratio of rigs needed or running to keep a frac crew busy? Is that changing? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. That's gone down a little bit. So it's moved down a small percentage but, yes, with the efficiency improvements in operating times for the rigs. And again, on aggregate over the last few years, that certainly has changed a little bit. But I think it's also important to note when you get into a discussion on rig efficiency, rig efficiency now is looking relatively flat over the last year after having improved over the last two years. And a lot of that is not just – we get into a lot of complications talking about what it means in terms of rig efficiency and what drives that, but the thing you have to remember is our rigs are still as efficient as they were yesterday but you have so many more operators working now than you did in 2016, and not all of the operators are as efficient. Some of the smaller operators that are now working in some of the states that have shorter programs are just not as efficient as some of the bigger program drillers. So it changes that drilling efficiency equation when you look across aggregated numbers across the U.S. Ken Sill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. That makes sense. All right. Thank you, guys. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC Thank you. Just on the pressure pumping guidance, I wanted to confirm that that includes the addition of one crew from here in the third quarter that was mentioned in the press release. Is that correct? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. That's correct. Yeah, we're taking into account the labor that we're bringing on to crew up that frac spread that starts in early third quarter. Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks. Sorry my phone cut out there for the last part of your comment, Andy, but I think I got it. And as it relates to additional crews that could be added in the second quarter, is it such that the lead time is just so long that, really, you couldn't get any additional crews to work in the second quarter to meaningfully increase the revenue. It's more of a third quarter benefit at this point? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I think it's the way we look at the market. And I've heard various pronouncements by other companies. But the way we look at it is we're still very focused on margin. We want to get good returns for our frac crews. We're also very focused on ensuring that we continue to deliver high service quality as we increase the number of frac spreads that are working. So our approach may be a little bit more measured, but we're going to protect the margins and do our best to continue to deliver high margins in this business. Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC All right. Okay. And on the rig side, you mentioned 198 APEX-class rigs now with the combined company. How many of those, or maybe it's all of those, would you consider to be upgradable to super-spec? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I would consider all of them upgradable to super-spec. We mentioned that we have 100 super-spec rigs today. And I also mentioned that we've actually increased our CapEx projection for what we'll be spending on rig upgrades and new builds. Where we said it's going to be $115 million at the last call, we raised that to $145 million for this call. Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then last one. Mark, I appreciate the comment on having just closed the merger, but it does seem to – the guidance for G&A seems to just be the combined G&A for the two companies. One, is that true? And two, kind of how quickly do you think we'll start to see the benefit of the synergies that you talked about? John E. Vollmer - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Yeah. This is John Vollmer. Yes, for the quarter, it reflects their full G&A plus about $3 million for the 71-day period. And we assume we get additional savings in the third and fourth quarter. And I believe Andy's intention is that we will have the synergies accomplished by the end of the year, as previously indicated. Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. And that number is still $50 million? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. We believe that's still a good number. That's a number that we gave when we announced the merger. And you got to remember, at the same time, activity continues to increase and the head count for the combined companies is going to be greater at the end of the year than it is today. John E. Vollmer - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. And one other point on the synergies and the cost savings opportunities: those aren't all G&A. A portion of that relates to operating costs and drilling and pressure pumping, given our increased scale, buying power, et cetera. Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And I'll turn it back. Operator Thank you. And our last question comes from John Daniel with Simmons & Company. Your line is open. John Daniel - Simmons & Company International Hey, guys. Thanks for putting me in. Just a sort of a big-picture question here. Now that we are sufficiently deep into earnings season, it feels as if everyone, including you guys, are managing their businesses assuming we migrate from, call it, $50 world to $60 oil. Given that we're now back again sub-50%, and who knows what OPEC's going to do, at what point do you think Patterson may be starts to manage for a $50 world and what would that entail? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Well, John, it's an interesting question but I don't think we've ever really said that we're managing for $60 oil. The way we look at it is, over the last period of time since summer of 2016 with oil trading in the $50 to $55 range, rig count goes up. John Daniel - Simmons & Company International Yeah. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. And when we've seen these pull-backs into $47, $48 range, we haven't seen customers who'd make plans to change those plans. And so, while there may be some customers that take a pause at $47, $48, it appears to us that if customers/operators already have these plans in place they continue on with these plans. John Daniel - Simmons & Company International Okay. Fair enough. Just one final one. And I know it's early into the Seventy Seven deal, but I'm curious if you can say whether or not the Great Plains business will be core to you guys or if this is something that you might part ways with? And the reason I ask is I recall you guys having sold other non-core product lines following other deals and I'm thinking specifically about Wireline after you bought the Key deal. Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I'll answer the question by saying at this point we like the business, we like the opportunities that we think we see in the business and so we have no current intention whatsoever to part with the business at this point. I think there's opportunities to expand it. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Yeah. We see potential to expand this business with the Patterson-UTI footprint. John Daniel - Simmons & Company International Yeah. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Great Plains Oilfield Rentals has a footprint based on the company that it was a part of and the single customer it was servicing historically. They've done a great job at expanding their customer base. And now we offer more facilities and a larger geographic footprint for them to expand into well, along with a great balance sheet behind them. Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. John, one additional thought. We basically like rental businesses is the first point. John Daniel - Simmons & Company International Yeah. Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. And the second point is, fundamentally, is that the first exposure I ever had to the oil patch was in the oilfield rental tool business. So, quite honestly, I'm feeling very comfortable about this one. John Daniel - Simmons & Company International Fair enough. Just thought I'd ask. Thanks, guys. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks. Operator I'm not showing any further questions. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Siegel for closing remarks. Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I'd like to thank all the people who participated in our call and thank you for being interested in our company. We'll join you again at the end of next quarter. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks.

Our first question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Good morning, Sean. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC Let me start with pressure pumping. Andy, I was just curious to think about – you talked about the potential to reactivate more spreads in the second half. How do we think about the levers and timing that will guide those decisions? And then just thinking about a part of that calculus, are you getting net margin improvement beyond cost recovery at this stage? And how does that factor into those decisions? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Yeah. I guess to start with, let me just talk about the margin. I think certainly part of the margin expansion you saw in our first quarter results include net pricing increases that we were able to get towards the end of the quarter, and we see the potential for this to continue as well. In terms of reactivation, we have about 30% of our total 1.5 million horsepower that's stacked right now. And we see opportunity to activate that equipment in the second half, at various points in the second half, starting with one crew early in the third quarter. Outside of that, we're going to move basically with the market demand on activity. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And then just drilling side, I was just curious if you could give us a sense of the magnitude of how much of a day-rate premium you're able to get for an upgraded super-spec rig, compared to just a high-spec AC rig that's in the market, or even a relatively newer well-equipped SCR rig? Just trying to get a sense of the delta between those two in the market. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Well, in some ways, they're not exactly related because the high-spec rig market is just moving in a different pace and that's what we see in the majority of the demand. And we've seen pricing continuing to move up on high-spec/super-spec rigs through the first quarter, and as rig count continues to go up, pricing on those rigs continues to go up. We do see that over time that, because the high-spec/super-spec category pricing is moving up, that it lifts the SCR pricing at the same time. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. So your expectation would be that as high-spec rigs go, SCR kind of has to go with it or else there's some kind of – at some point, that gap gets wider as a substitution effect, so you need to see movement on the SCR rigs as well. Is that the right way to think about it? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. No, it's not a substitution. These are different markets. But the high-spec rig market lifts the SCR market. Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, sir. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Marshall Adkins with Raymond James. Your line is open. J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Morning, guys. It sounds like the Seventy Seven, both rig and pressure pumping fleets, are being priced lower and it sounds like you have confidence you can get them up. So, to drill down on that issue, were they being priced lower because they're lower in quality or were they just trying to maintain a higher utilization and to do that they needed a price lower? Help me understand why you're confident you're going to get pricing and margins from that side of the business up. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. First off, let's clarify. Seventy Seven Energy has a great team with great assets and they run great quality operations. But Seventy Seven had a special challenge in that they had to expand their market base from a single customer base to multiple customers, and we applaud what they've done. We think they've done a tremendous job. But that had some challenges at the same time. In the timing of us merging the two companies together, it's just the net difference in the results of the margins that you see today. But both the market and then the improvements in the market and then the combination of the merger with Patterson-UTI and Seventy Seven together improves our overall geographic footprint, it improves our overall combined customer base, and so we see good potential there. J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Some of your competitors, as they've reactivated equipment both on the rig and the pressure pumping side, have really been dinged on margins. So far, you guys seem – your margins have ramped up really nicely with activity. It seems like you're passing on more of the sand and logistics cost that maybe some others are. So help me walk through going forward, as you reactivate more of this equipment, should we worry about maybe delayed margin improvement as you reactivate them? Or do you think you can stay ahead of that? And same question on the sand and last-mile logistics pass-throughs. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. So, in terms of the products, whether it's sand or chemicals, I think that our supply chain team has done a great job in managing the contracts that we have with our various suppliers across the U.S. And we have a number of different contracts in place that are layered, that expire at different points during the year. And what you saw between Q4 and Q1, the net result is very little movement in our average sand cost. And any movement that we had, we were able to pass that through. Combined with some net pricing improvements towards the end of Q1 gave us the margin expansion that we saw in pressure pumping. We do think that the market is tight on some of the finer mesh sizes, but we do also think that we're very comfortable with our contract position. And even though we might see some single-digit price increases on average going from Q1 to Q2, we have that factored into the projected margins as well. In terms of reactivation costs for pressure pumping spreads, the earlier fleets that we reactivated were costing us on average about $2 million per spread. We see this average going forward to be about $3 million to $4 million per spread, and that's really a cash cost that includes the labor. So, as you know, for 24-hour operations, it's at least 100 people that are coming on in a 60- to 90-day period before we even generate revenue. So we will see those costs in front of the revenue stream from each of those frac spreads as we continue to reactivate spreads going forward in 2017. J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. All right. Great. So the margin guidance at flattish with improving activity, you mentioned it's because you're rolling in the lower-margin Seventy Seven stuff. Is part of that lower margin guidance that your reactivation costs are going to go up? Or is it just more of the Seventy Seven stuff rolling in, and then over time that gets back up to where you are? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. It's a combination. I wouldn't say that it's reactivation costs going up necessarily, but more reactivation costs included in that future cost base as we reactivate spreads. J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Right. All right. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Operator Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Alexander D. Nuta - Evercore ISI Hey. How are you? This is Alex on for James. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Morning. Alexander D. Nuta - Evercore ISI My first question is on the Seventy Seven drilling assets. During the merger call, you guys didn't really highlight the SCR rigs. The 58 rigs operating would seem to indicate they received pretty good traction in the interim. Have you guys been surprised about those and where do you see that segment fitting in to your broader fleet? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. So we haven't been surprised on our side in terms of their utilization on their SCR fleet. You got to remember that Seventy Seven Energy has some of the newest SCR rigs that are out there in the market today and these are very competitive rigs. So, in some cases, their SCR rigs are going to have some of the same performance in some bases as some of the high-spec rigs that are out there as well, just because they're relatively new SCR rigs. So we're certainly pleased with the performance of their rig count overall. And we expect the SCR utilization to continue and improve with rig count overall, but it's also customer-specific. You've got certain customers that are out there and all they want to see is a high-spec or super-spec rig. But we do have customers that are out there using SCR rigs and very pleased with the utilization that Seventy Seven had on the SCR fleet. Alexander D. Nuta - Evercore ISI Understood. And then my second question kind of similar to Marshall, I guess how much – in the second quarter pressure pumping guidance, how much of that is net pricing increases versus the dilution? And I guess my question becomes – it sounds like 2Q becomes transitory and then we see some of the benefits in 3Q. Is that fair? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I think it's fair to say that you've got a combination of several things happening. You have the combination of the merger of the two companies and the net margin result there. You've also got activation costs for further frac spreads from a labor component where you have labor on-boarding before we generate revenue. And there's just various moving parts in there. And that's kind of what's happening in the second quarter. Even though we might see some increases in the sand cost in the single-digit percentile for the finer meshes, we believe that we have that covered in the margin as well. Alexander D. Nuta - Evercore ISI Understood. Thank you. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question is from the line of Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Good morning, guys. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Hey, Jim. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) The pressure pumping business was nothing short of amazing. The number of jobs was down to 14% and the average margin per job blew away our expectations. And I realize that may just be our problem with expectations. But can you talk about how – I mean was it – I understand prices at the end of the quarter, but this is for the whole quarter. Can you talk to me about how you did such a good job, I guess is what I'm asking? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Well, I have to give the credit to the teams in the field. I mean, our teams are really good at solid execution, running lean operations but still delivering high service quality at the same time. And because of that, we were able to push some pricing during the quarter and get some net pricing adds and continue to deliver service quality and improve operational efficiency and improve stages per day with some customers. So I have to give credit to the teams. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Well, margin per job of $58,000 versus $16,000 in Q4, that looks like a whole lot more than price. And I appreciate you all's execution. You all had the best margins longer coming into the down cycle than anybody else. That was just surprising to me, so. Okay. And going forward, you talk about how you've got your sand contracted. Do you make money on sand? And how much of your revenues in pressure pumping was the pass-through of sand? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. So we do have a small margin on sand. The interesting thing is it's a smaller margin than the service. So, if we're pumping more sand in a given month or a given quarter then it becomes dilutive to the margin. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Right. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. And it does vary from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter, but we do make a small margin on sand. But I believe as activity continues to increase during 2017 following the macro on increasing rig count, then these net pricings increases that we've seen on services also move into the small margin that we get on the products as well over time. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Okay. And last, if I could, congratulations on Seventy Seven. I think that's an excellent acquisition. You've got a 15% debt to cap. Are you through? Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Jim, we're never through. We're always looking for good opportunities, Jim, so. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Okay. But it took you a long time to do this one. So do we have to wait this long to do the next one? Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Jim, my crystal ball is a little fuzzy on how long it takes for the next deal. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Okay. I mean, you don't want the market to run away from you before you have the chance though, right? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Well, I think the interesting thing in this market is I don't think you have to rush and I think the market can still have opportunities over the next couple of years. James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Okay, guys. Thanks so much. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC Hey. Actually that was pretty good. That last name, pretty good. So I guess let's talk about your guidance. Trying to put the pieces together. Can you just confirm that your guidance implies about $100 million of EBITDA in 2Q? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Don't have that in front of me for the overall combined EBITDA of all the different companies. Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. All right. I'll just follow up after the call just to make sure we have all the moving pieces right. I guess I also wanted to chat about the contracts for SSE on the pumping side and on the land rig side with Chesapeake. So could you talk to that? When those roll off on the rig side and the pumping side? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I think the best way to describe it is with the combined businesses with Patterson-UTI plus Seventy Seven Energy on the drilling side, we don't have any situation with contracts that produces any headwind other than ongoing long-term contracts. What's happening in the margins in the drilling business, and I'm talking about the combined new business, is for rigs that are moving out we see improving margins. We have some contracts that we've had for a while. As those roll off, those are going to roll closer to a spot at the lower margins. So we have several moving pieces there. And then combining the two entities together, you get the net result of the margin projection that we gave you for the second quarter. In pressure pumping, in terms of contracts what we see is it's really about two-thirds of our active fleets have the ability to move the pricing with the market. Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. All right. And so we can have the right run rate as we get into 3Q, could you just help us with what the underlying rig count assumption is for SSE in 2Q because we don't have a full quarter there, and then the same for the revenue side on pressure pumping? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. It really gets back to the averages that we gave you. We expect that the rig count is going to continue to increase during the second quarter. And including both Seventy Seven's fleets and Patterson-UTI's fleet, we expect the rig count in the U.S. will average 143 in the second quarter. Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. So what does that assume that – so if we think of legacy PTEN, how much is that assumed to be up in 2Q? That'll help us. 20% William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Yeah. We're moving on to combined company numbers now. Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC Well, I know, but the thing is – so let me ask you, so 143 rigs, is that a pro forma for 90 days for SSE? Or is that a pro forma for 70 days? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. That's a function as of the close on April 20. Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC Right. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. (38:14) Chase Mulvehill - Wolfe Research LLC I can follow up afterwards, but basically I'm trying to understand – I want to understand what SSE is, the run rate, going into 3Q. We just don't have a full quarter. I'll follow up after the call. Thank you. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question is from Brad Handler with Jefferies. Your line is open. Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC Thanks, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking my call. If my question is redundant, I apologize. I had to hop off for just a couple of minutes. But can we talk first about drilling operating expenses? So, obviously, you've given us the margin guidance on the second quarter, so it's $13,900 a day. That I get. Obviously, there was also some volatility, some fluctuation as standby rigs came off and then you also have a little bit of sort of the reactivation cost of bringing rigs back into service I guess. How can we think about that maybe in 3Q? Where should we think about operating expenses a little bit longer-term just settling out for you, please? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Without going into the details of 3Q, I think it's safe to say that we're getting closer to the bottom in margins. But we still, as I mentioned earlier and it's no problem to repeat, as I mentioned earlier, we have some moving pieces here because we have a mix of contracts that we've had for a while now that are rolling off and moving closer to spot. We have rigs going out that are increasing in margin as they go out. And then we have the combination of the merger. We also have rig reactivations where we have labor costs in front of the revenue of the rig. So there's moving pieces in there, but we're getting close to the bottom in the margins. Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC Okay. That's certainly good to hear. And I guess I was just trying to parse it on operating expenses, per se. And so, if I remove the rig reactivation element of that, maybe it's a combined – so it's a combined fleet question of course, but where do you think daily OpEx sort of settles out? John E. Vollmer - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. We think it's similar on a per day basis. We don't really pull the rig reactivation costs out of that. So per day would be similar. Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC So it will wind up staying similar to where you're talking about for Q2? John E. Vollmer - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Correct. Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC Is that what you mean to suggest? Okay. Got it. John E. Vollmer - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Yes. Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC Okay. And then I guess maybe just a quick follow-up for me just on that last answer to one of Chase's questions. So, in other words, do you have contract commitments and therefore fixed pricing on roughly a third of the pro forma pressure pumping fleet? Is that the – just want to make sure I'm interpreting what you said correctly. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Yeah. And let me say it this way. So, two-thirds of our active fleet has the ability to move with pricing and the one-third that's under either some kind of contract or pricing agreement doesn't extend very long through the year. I would say that the majority of that rolls off before the end of 2017, if that helps. Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC It does. It does. Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll turn it back. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question is from the line of (41:34).Your line is open. Our next question is going to be from Michael Lamotte with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC Hey. Good morning, guys. Andy, I know there's a lot of moving pieces and I want to sort of get back to the structural cost differences between Patterson and Seventy Seven. And maybe if we look at first quarter as the baseline and you look at the difference in margin in the two businesses, how much of that difference would you say is contract and pricing-related versus cost structure? I mean, is it a 30%-70% split, 50%-50%? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I think there's a mix of both, without getting into the details. Patterson-UTI is a larger enterprise than Seventy Seven was in the first quarter. So we had a little bit more efficiency in the supporting costs side. There's also an element of pricing on the Seventy Seven side as they expanded their customer base and did a great job doing that. But it's really about the go-forward and we feel like we're in a good position for the combined entities moving forward through the year. Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC Well, that's actually what I was trying to get at is sort of thinking about the speed with which sort of normalized margins – you could begin to normalize those Seventy Seven margins to the Patterson level and what the frictional elements are to that? I mean, you mentioned on the answer to Marshall's question that moving from single to multiple customers is sort of frictional. But is there anything other than that dynamic that slows this margin progression down or uplift slows it down? Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Michael, I just would observe that we closed the merger exactly one week ago. And at this point, we're still getting our arms around all the details of their operations. And so, giving an exact prediction as to when their margins increase and get to the same level as the Patterson margins, pretty difficult for us to give a good fix on that at this moment a week later. Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC Fair enough. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. But I will reiterate... Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC I'll follow up with you next week. Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks for that. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I will reiterate that second quarter margins are nearing the bottom for us. Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC Okay. And then, Andy, on the 90% utilization for super-specs, as we start reactivating rigs sort of further in the stack, are they geographically in the right markets? Are we, within a quarter or two, going to start to see rigs needing to move? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I think in some cases we'll have some rigs moved. I think that when we do move rigs, we get support in the contract from customers to help offset the costs to move those rigs. And in our particular case, we have the opportunity to continue to do some upgrades. I went through the list of items in the total CapEx. One of the pieces that's interesting there, if you go back to what we said on the last call, in terms of rig upgrades and new builds at the last call, we said we had earmarked $115 million in the CapEx budget. Now we're at $145 million in the CapEx budget. And we're certainly happy with the pricing levels we're getting on the projections for what the payback is on those upgrades. Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC Yeah. It's still looking at less than a year, payback? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I wouldn't say it's less than a year but it's in that two- to three-year range... Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC Okay. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. ...on that upgrade component. Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC And then last one for me. In light of the OneStim joint venture, now having two competitors with roughly 3 million horsepower in capacity, does it change the thinking on scale in the frac business? It wasn't that long ago that we thought 1 million horsepower was sufficient scale and now you guys are at 1.5 million horsepower and scale just seems to be moving. How do you think about it? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. In general, I think that scale still matters in this business, especially because of everything that happens before you even get to the well side. But I think it's important – when you look at Patterson-UTI and now the combined merger of Patterson-UTI and Seventy Seven Energy and our footprint, we're a 1.5 million horsepower. So we're not as big as the two that you mentioned, but we're not in all the basins that they're in either. So our focus is with the primary aspect of our horsepower, 850,000 horsepower is in Texas. And we're also in the Mid-Continent and we're also in Appalachia. So, if you look at our concentration in the regions that we're working, we think we're in great shape. Michael Lamotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC Great. Thanks, guys. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question is from the line of Ken Sill with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open. Ken Sill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thank you. Surprised to get in here. So one of the questions, you were talking about the costs for reactivating a frac fleet, and saying that you're hiring an average of 100 people per crew. I'm assuming that's for 24-hour operations. That just seemed a little bit high to me. How many people do you guys run in an average crew? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. The average pressure pumping crew that's working 24-hour operations for us has 100 to 110 people on it. We generate over 90% of our revenues, of our total active fleet, from 24-hour operations. So, when we do these reactivations, we're going to have labor costs as we bring on people before we start generating revenue from a particular frac spread. And that labor cost can start 90 days before we generate revenue. And that labor cost grows over that 90-day period before we generate that revenue. Ken Sill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. I was just surprised by the head count. So, that kind of leads to a second question, which is, are you guys seeing an evolution in the size of the average frac spread you're putting out? What's the average spread, particularly in Texas, in terms of hydraulic horsepower today versus what would it have been a couple years ago? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Yeah. We've seen somewhat growth in the amount of horsepower that we put out. Some of it has to do with just changes in the operating pressures in where we're fracking these days versus where we may have fracked historically. So we previously might have lifted a frac spread at a 40,000 to 45,000 horsepower and today, depending on where it is in the U.S., it might be 45,000 to 50,000 horsepower. Ken Sill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. And final question, just trying to figure out what capacity could be out there, I mean what you can do with the fleet. Given you got longer laterals and higher sand loadings, you're solving that issue with more horsepower. Does it take more time to pump a bigger sand load? Or is that just a function of – I mean, there's a lot of moving pieces, but just on average does it take more time to pump a bigger sand loading per stage? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Certainly when you compare a horizontal well today versus what we were drilling two years ago on average in Texas, with longer laterals and higher volumes, we are pumping more time. But what that means for the industry in general, if you look at the total number of wells that have to be completed during the year, it takes more time to pump on that aggregate number of wells, which means more frac crews operating than historically in the past for the same number of wells. Ken Sill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Yeah. Well, actually and that leads to another question and then I'll stop. With the rigs getting more efficient, is the ratio of rigs needed or running to keep a frac crew busy? Is that changing? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. That's gone down a little bit. So it's moved down a small percentage but, yes, with the efficiency improvements in operating times for the rigs. And again, on aggregate over the last few years, that certainly has changed a little bit. But I think it's also important to note when you get into a discussion on rig efficiency, rig efficiency now is looking relatively flat over the last year after having improved over the last two years. And a lot of that is not just – we get into a lot of complications talking about what it means in terms of rig efficiency and what drives that, but the thing you have to remember is our rigs are still as efficient as they were yesterday but you have so many more operators working now than you did in 2016, and not all of the operators are as efficient. Some of the smaller operators that are now working in some of the states that have shorter programs are just not as efficient as some of the bigger program drillers. So it changes that drilling efficiency equation when you look across aggregated numbers across the U.S. Ken Sill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. That makes sense. All right. Thank you, guys. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC Thank you. Just on the pressure pumping guidance, I wanted to confirm that that includes the addition of one crew from here in the third quarter that was mentioned in the press release. Is that correct? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. That's correct. Yeah, we're taking into account the labor that we're bringing on to crew up that frac spread that starts in early third quarter. Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks. Sorry my phone cut out there for the last part of your comment, Andy, but I think I got it. And as it relates to additional crews that could be added in the second quarter, is it such that the lead time is just so long that, really, you couldn't get any additional crews to work in the second quarter to meaningfully increase the revenue. It's more of a third quarter benefit at this point? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I think it's the way we look at the market. And I've heard various pronouncements by other companies. But the way we look at it is we're still very focused on margin. We want to get good returns for our frac crews. We're also very focused on ensuring that we continue to deliver high service quality as we increase the number of frac spreads that are working. So our approach may be a little bit more measured, but we're going to protect the margins and do our best to continue to deliver high margins in this business. Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC All right. Okay. And on the rig side, you mentioned 198 APEX-class rigs now with the combined company. How many of those, or maybe it's all of those, would you consider to be upgradable to super-spec? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I would consider all of them upgradable to super-spec. We mentioned that we have 100 super-spec rigs today. And I also mentioned that we've actually increased our CapEx projection for what we'll be spending on rig upgrades and new builds. Where we said it's going to be $115 million at the last call, we raised that to $145 million for this call. Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then last one. Mark, I appreciate the comment on having just closed the merger, but it does seem to – the guidance for G&A seems to just be the combined G&A for the two companies. One, is that true? And two, kind of how quickly do you think we'll start to see the benefit of the synergies that you talked about? John E. Vollmer - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Yeah. This is John Vollmer. Yes, for the quarter, it reflects their full G&A plus about $3 million for the 71-day period. And we assume we get additional savings in the third and fourth quarter. And I believe Andy's intention is that we will have the synergies accomplished by the end of the year, as previously indicated. Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. And that number is still $50 million? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. We believe that's still a good number. That's a number that we gave when we announced the merger. And you got to remember, at the same time, activity continues to increase and the head count for the combined companies is going to be greater at the end of the year than it is today. John E. Vollmer - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. And one other point on the synergies and the cost savings opportunities: those aren't all G&A. A portion of that relates to operating costs and drilling and pressure pumping, given our increased scale, buying power, et cetera. Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And I'll turn it back. Operator Thank you. And our last question comes from John Daniel with Simmons & Company. Your line is open. John Daniel - Simmons & Company International Hey, guys. Thanks for putting me in. Just a sort of a big-picture question here. Now that we are sufficiently deep into earnings season, it feels as if everyone, including you guys, are managing their businesses assuming we migrate from, call it, $50 world to $60 oil. Given that we're now back again sub-50%, and who knows what OPEC's going to do, at what point do you think Patterson may be starts to manage for a $50 world and what would that entail? William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Well, John, it's an interesting question but I don't think we've ever really said that we're managing for $60 oil. The way we look at it is, over the last period of time since summer of 2016 with oil trading in the $50 to $55 range, rig count goes up. John Daniel - Simmons & Company International Yeah. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. And when we've seen these pull-backs into $47, $48 range, we haven't seen customers who'd make plans to change those plans. And so, while there may be some customers that take a pause at $47, $48, it appears to us that if customers/operators already have these plans in place they continue on with these plans. John Daniel - Simmons & Company International Okay. Fair enough. Just one final one. And I know it's early into the Seventy Seven deal, but I'm curious if you can say whether or not the Great Plains business will be core to you guys or if this is something that you might part ways with? And the reason I ask is I recall you guys having sold other non-core product lines following other deals and I'm thinking specifically about Wireline after you bought the Key deal. Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I'll answer the question by saying at this point we like the business, we like the opportunities that we think we see in the business and so we have no current intention whatsoever to part with the business at this point. I think there's opportunities to expand it. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Yeah. We see potential to expand this business with the Patterson-UTI footprint. John Daniel - Simmons & Company International Yeah. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Great Plains Oilfield Rentals has a footprint based on the company that it was a part of and the single customer it was servicing historically. They've done a great job at expanding their customer base. And now we offer more facilities and a larger geographic footprint for them to expand into well, along with a great balance sheet behind them. Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. John, one additional thought. We basically like rental businesses is the first point. John Daniel - Simmons & Company International Yeah. Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. And the second point is, fundamentally, is that the first exposure I ever had to the oil patch was in the oilfield rental tool business. So, quite honestly, I'm feeling very comfortable about this one. John Daniel - Simmons & Company International Fair enough. Just thought I'd ask. Thanks, guys. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks. Operator I'm not showing any further questions. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Siegel for closing remarks. Mark Steven Siegel - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. I'd like to thank all the people who participated in our call and thank you for being interested in our company. We'll join you again at the end of next quarter. William A. Hendricks, Jr. - Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Thanks.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ashish Saran, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ashish Saran Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Limited. After market close today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. If you did not receive a cope, you may obtain the information from the Investor section of Broadcom’s website at  www.broadcom.com . This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be made available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investor section of our website at broadcom.com. During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our first quarter year 2017 results, background to our second quarter fiscal year 2017 outlook, and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today’s press release. Comments made during today’s call will primarily refer to are non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. At this time, I would like to turn the call over the Hock Tan. Hock? Hock Tan Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon everyone. Well, we delivered strong financial results for the first quarter with revenue of $41.5 billion and gross margin at 62.4%, both at a very top end of our guidance. Earnings per share of $3.63 grew by 5% sequentially, while net revenue was essentially flat. Revenue was better than expected in all four segments. The benefits we achieved through business diversification clearly came through this quarter with growth in Wired, Enterprise Storage, and Industrial completely offsetting the typical negative seasonality from Wireless. The integration of classic Broadcom has gone very well and is now mostly complete. We remain focused on driving financial performance towards our long-term operating margin and free cash flow targets. Let me now turn to a discussion of our segment results, starting with Wired, our largest segment. In the first quarter, Wired revenue came in at $2.09 billion better than expected and represented 50% of our total revenue. Revenue for this segment was up slightly on a sequential basis, benefited from strong demand for Ethernet Switching and Routing products from cloud data center operators. This growth was partially offset by the continuing seasonal decline in demand for our broadband carrier access and set-top box products, which we expect to bottom in this first quarter. Turning to the second fiscal quarter, we forecast Wired revenue experience sequential growth a little bit stronger than what we saw in the prior quarter. We expect the momentum from cloud data center demand to sustain and expect a seasonal increase in demand for our broadband access and set-top box products. Now moving on to Wireless. In the first quarter, Wireless revenue came in at about $1.18 billion, better than expect and Wireless segment represented 28% of our total revenues. Revenue for this core segment was down 13% sequentially, driven by the expected seasonal decline in demand from a major North American customer. Turning now to our projection for the second quarter fiscal of 2017, we expect to hit the bottom of annual product cycle transition at a major North American customer. However, we expect to offset a significant portion of this decline in Wireless from a ramp of the next generation phone as our large Korean smartphone customer. This phone comes with an increase in Broadcom's RF and Wi-Fi connectivity content. As a result, we expect our Wireless revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to be still sequentially down, but in the high single-digits better than the more typical double-digit declines we have experienced in prior years. Let me now turn to Enterprise Storage, which continues to be strong. In the first quarter, Enterprise Storage revenue came in at $707 million and this segment represented 17% of our total revenue. Segment revenue grew 26% sequentially, gaining better than expected driven by stronger shipments of SAS, RAID, and Fiber Channel products. As we foresaw, our hard disk drive and custom solid state drives controllers also had a very strong quarter. And looking into the second quarter, however, we believe this resurgence of Enterprise Storage has to taper off and hence flatten out. Having said that, backlog for Enterprise Storage products continues up to today to be very strong. But we foresaw what we foresee seasonality to start slowing demand in the third quarter if not in this -- late in the second quarter. Finally, turning to our last segment, Industrial. In the first quarter, Industrial revenue grew -- came in at $180 million, up 11% sequentially better than expected as we rebuild depleted channel inventory consistent with stronger product resales. The industrial segment represented 5% of our total revenue and as we look into the second quarter, we are anticipating industrial activity to continue to improve seasonally and accordingly, we are expecting industrial segment revenue to increase by high single-digits sequentially. With all that to sump-up -- to simply sum-up, this second quarter was strong, revenue flat from the seasonally high fourth quarter of the preceding year. As we know look into the second quarter, we expect this demand environment for our products to continue to be very healthy and our outlook for this quarter's revenue to be virtually flat to that of the prior quarter. It is becoming evident that our broader and more diversified product portfolio has largely mitigated seasonal impacts to consolidated revenue during the first half of the year. This is certainly an intrinsic goal of our business model just that we did not expect to achieve these so soon. The integration of classic Broadcom is clearly going well and we continue to invest across all our franchise products. We are sustaining our technology leadership and our products are very well received by our customers. Our revenue trajectory from the first half of fiscal 2017 could possibly extend into the second half. Nonetheless, we do not expect that the approximate 15% level of year-on-year growth we are guiding for the second quarter to really be sustainable in the long-term. Our long-term operating model will continue to assume mid-single-digit annual revenue growth for the consolidated business. With that let me now turn the call over to Tom for detailed review our first quarter fiscal 2017 financials. Tom Krause Thank you, Hock, good afternoon everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today that is available on our website at Broadcom.com. Let me first start out by saying that we are very pleased with the execution this quarter and specifically the progress we've made towards our long-term target model, which remains an operating margin target of 45% of net revenue and a free cash flow margin above 35% of net revenue. Further to what Hock was saying, we also believe that we can achieve these long-term operating targets based on a sustainable long-term revenue growth rate of mid-single-digits. Now, let me review the Q1 results. Revenue for the quarter came in at $4.15 billion, approximately flat sequentially. Foxconn was greater than 10% direct customer in the first fiscal quarter. Our first quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 62.4%, about 90 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to revenue at the top end of guidance and a slightly better product mix. This quarter's gross margin also benefitted from the impact of approximately $60 million of revenue related to the assignment of certain manufacturing rights to a customer in our Wired segment, which is included in our original guidance. Turning to OpEx, R&D expenses were $664 million and SG&A expenses were $120 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the first quarter of $784 million, or 18.9% of net revenue. As Hock mentioned, we have not largely completed the integration of classic Broadcom and I would reiterate that we feel comfortable at this level of operating expenses relative net revenue. Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.8 billion and represented 43.5% of net revenue. Provision for taxes came in at $77 million, slightly above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher than expected net income. First quarter interest expense of $110 million and other income net was $8 million. First quarter net income was $1.63 billion and earnings per diluted share were $3.63. Our share-based compensation expense in the first quarter was $201 million. Moving on to the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding were 43 days, a decrease of five days from the prior quarter due to better linearity of revenue in the quarter. Our inventory ended at $1.34 billion, a decrease of $64 million from the beginning of the quarter. We generated $1.35 billion in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact of approximately $313 million for annual employee bonus payments for fiscal year 2016 and approximately $80 million of cash expended on classic Broadcom restructuring integration activities including discontinued operations. I'm very pleased that in the first quarter, the business already demonstrated the ability to generate free cash flow close to our long-term target model of 35%, while free cash flow in the first quarter was $1 billion approximately or only 25% of net revenue. This does include I want to highlight the impact from the annual employee cash bonus payment as well as cash restructuring expenses and capital expenditures that as we discussed before running higher than our long-term targets. Looking forward, we expect classic Broadcom related restructuring expenses to continue to decrease as we finish this integration. Capital expenditure in the first quarter was $325 million or 7.8% of net revenue. However, we expect long-term CapEx largely to fabless semiconductor company to run at about 3% of net revenue consistent with that fabless business model. As a reminder for full fiscal year 2017, we expect CapEx to run at an elevated level of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes about $500 million towards campus construction, primarily at our Irvine and San Jose locations and about $200 million towards purchasing of test equipment to consignment at our CMs. A total of $431 million in cash was spent on company dividend and partnership distribution payments in the first quarter. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of approximately $3.5 billion. Now let me turn to non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. Net revenue is expected to be $4.1 billion plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 62%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $789 million. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $74 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $106 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 452 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately $223 million. CapEx will be approximately $290 million. And you have seen, our Board has declared a dividend of $1.02 per share to be paid later in the second fiscal quarter. We're also looking forward to completing the acquisition of Brocade, which is proceeding as planned and we presently expect to close this transaction in our third quarter of fiscal 2017. I'm pleased that we're able to reach an agreement with ARRIS earlier this quarter for the sale of Brocade's network edge business for $800 million in cash plus the additional cost of unvested employee stock awards. Following Brocade's recent results, we continue to feel very comfortable that Brocade's Fiber Channel San Switching business, the key business that we're focused on will generate approximately $900 million of EBITDA in fiscal 2018. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore Hey guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess Hock the first question is on the Wireless side. It's good to see the content rising at other customers besides just your big North American customer; can you talk a little bit more detail about what's driving that content up? Is there anything unique or is it basically the same goodness that you've seen in the North America side? And any more color about that goodness continuing on the North America side into the second half of this year would also be helpful. Thanks. Hock Tan Yes, Ross thanks for the question. Yes, it's -- in fact it's a phenomenon we have been indicating to you guys for the last several years which is over the medium term -- long-term, I would say, our strength of franchise in cellular and our RF cellular analog, the front end cellular analog, which includes FBAR and power amplifiers and all the circuitry and component that goes in front of the transceiver in the handset for cellular. That's one area and the other area in Wi-Fi Bluetooth connectivity. Those two functionality, those two features in phones continue to evolve and with each generation. And as each generation evolves, when it involves, in the case of RF cellular is two-fold. One is basically more band as we progress -- as more and more countries globally progress into 4G and eventually even further beyond that. More and more bands -- spectral bandwidths get pulled into the fold and number of skills of phones get less and less for any major OEM manufacturer simply because of complexity of these phones. And so because of more bands, it requires more filters, more components like power amplifiers -- low noise amplifiers and because of that necessary content increases. I should also add the difficulty of engineering those products increased fairly exponentially, which therefore drives towards better and better content for us into those very high-end flagship smartphones. In the case of wireless connectivity, the same phenomenon is happening and it's particularly driven on bandwidth on the peer [ph] throughput as we move from -- what we gradually move from what used to be much lower bandwidth in Wi-Fi to today's AC. As we move from to single users to multiple users and as we move next generation from AC into AX and further. Obviously, difficulty of doing those products in smartphones become correspondingly more difficult, content increases and we benefit from basically content increase. It's a normal phenomenon and we expect to see that continuing into the medium term. Ross Seymore Great, that's helpful. I guess for my one follow-up, both you and Tom, Hock, mentioned about the 15% growth not being your long-term assumption. Just wondering why you are bringing that up? Is there something you're seeing now that gives you pause that things are going to slow down or is this just a reminder that the level we are now is not the base assumption in your business model? Hock Tan I think the fairest way to answer that is we have articulated last fiscal year very clearly and even a year ago when we acquired Broadcom, as long as a year ago, that we were scaled and we were diversification of product portfolio. Our long-term model, out five years, 10 years is a compounded annual growth of 5%. Not every year necessarily, but long-term 5%. And why we feel the need to mention it is obviously you saw the numbers we were guiding for Q2 on the topline and they're showing 15% year-on-year from a year ago. That's just one quarter and obviously just one fiscal year, one point in time. So, we felt it necessary to just mention it that do not just take it and extrapolate it to say that we have move away from our broad model on guidance of 5% compounded annual growth in the long term to a 15%, far from it. Tom Krause And Ross, I mean just to add -- I also want to reiterate, we don't believe we need to have this accelerated revenue growth to hit our financial targets which we remain very focused on, specifically the free cash flow margins at 35%. We're very comfortable achieving those results based on a more normalized long-term CAGR of mid-single-digits. Ross Seymore Very well. Congrats on those results. Thanks a lot. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis Hey guys thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results. Just following-up on the Wireless guide, you've talked in the past sometimes it can be seasonal down 15%, 20% to the high single-digits. Just curious between contents and the units, what are you seeing with your two large customers in terms of the seasonality and the timing of the ramp magnitude versus the content gains you're seeing? Hock Tan To be -- I don't have specific data between to be able to speed out accurately between units and content, but off the cuff, my sense is it's largely content. Blayne Curtis Okay. And then you mentioned strength in switching, I was curious obviously you don't want to -- for a full year, I was just curious you talked about some businesses being soft in the second half. There's obviously a big upgrade cycle that's 2500G. Just curious your perspective as you look at the rest of the year the trajectory of the switch business? Hock Tan That's a very interesting question and on the switching side, which is a subset, obviously, of our Wired segment, which is our largest segment, but just if you look at our switching and routing sites, fair way to put it together, which is really data center networking business, we continue to see strength through the rest of the year. We see -- a big part of that strength we see is simply because of a very strong data center demand -- data center buildup by the cloud operators. We're seeing that now and I suspect that phenomenon will still continue, particularly when we start to ramp-up newer generation with high-bandwidth of Tomahawks and Tridents and as we go later part in the year of our DMX router and aggregation switches. So, we see that and this momentum to be fairly good based on demand -- intrinsic demand out there in data center expansion, especially into the cloud, but also from the fact that we're launching a few very key new products in this year. Blayne Curtis Thanks. Hock Tan Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question and it's great to see the diversity in the business playing out here. On the strong growth in the storage business that I'm assuming some of this is your SSD product lines; I believe you guys are supplying Enterprise SSD controllers into the top two enterprising cloud SSD suppliers. And I think your top customer here just grew their Enterprise SSD business I think 20% sequentially and 20% year-over-year in the December quarter. Wondering if you guys are seeing similar growth trends? And do you expect double-digit growth in the SSD segment for the full year? Hock Tan I'll be [Indiscernible] our visibility in the SSDs are not as good as perhaps our customers are. A big part of it is there are three parts to our Enterprise Storage, three broad parts, one is very related to storage server connectivity, that's the rate part and the Fiber Channel whole part side of it rate. And then there is the components we ship into hard disk drives. And hard disk drive has experience as you well know a strong surge over the last several months probably because flash have been in short supply. And the last and smallest part of our business in Enterprise Storage is really related to Enterprise flash controllers for SSD. And that's really a small part. So, we don't get that broad visibility into this SSD market as a lot of other people would. But you're, right now, it's very, very strong and especially in SAS. Harlan Sur Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then off of the success of Tomahawks and I also hear that your prior generation Trident is still very strong as well and the team is ramping into this upgrade cycle, but you started sampling Tomahawk II, I think it was second half of last year. Can you just give us an update on the qualification, customer feedback, and when should we see the adoption curve for T2 starting to ramp, is that going to be kind of 2018 timeframe? Hock Tan For very competitive reasons I really hate to give you specifics here. Suffice to say it's very well received. We have a lot of momentum on our entire switch portfolio. And by the way as Tomahawk doesn't fully replace Trident, Trident is using a different segment versus Tomahawk and both are going very well as are the Jericho products, which are more aggregation switching and routing. So, broadly our portfolio of -- from high end down to even low range -- on the low-end range of switching -- campus switching pointers [ph], those are all going very well. And I suspect it's all largely due to the strength in data center spending that still receive continue, particularly more recently since we had very strong conversion of Enterprises into the cloud. Harlan Sur Thanks Hock. Operator Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on the very strong results and outlook. I wanted to address the free cash flow margin trajectory. Tom I think you referred to some of this in your prepared remarks, but I'd like you to maybe highlight what aside from the restructuring expenses that are still being paid and the temporarily higher CapEx that you are experiencing, what are the other drivers to get you to the 35% free cash flow margin? And what sort of timing should we think about for that? Tom Krause William good question and I think that's sort of the point of the prepared remarks. And if you look at where we are from an operating margin perspective, you look at the fact we restructured the balance sheet around now fixed rate debt. If you look at our sustainable tax rate of 4.5% and cash taxes of approximately $100 million a quarter and you take out the restructuring costs, which are bleeding off here pretty quickly, you take out the one-time campus initiative, the one-time tester initiative this year which will sort of play itself out over the next couple of quarters. Frankly, we're largely there. And that's probably the real takeaway and of course that doesn't take into account what we would expect to be the second half seasonally up trends from a revenue perspective. William Stein It's helpful. Appreciate it. Maybe one more. Something that came up last quarter was the change in capital allocation strategy. Maybe you can sort of highlight for us your plans on the M&A front from here despite the higher dividend -- the significantly higher free cash flow that you are going to be generating I guess after these temporary expenses falloff would seem to meet to continue to support a good M&A pipeline. Maybe you can characterize for us please? Tom Krause Yes, I mean there's no real uptick there other than we outlined very clearly that we're going to continue to drive given back 50% of free cash flows to investors in the form of dividends, which, of course, at these levels, would imply that we're going to have the ability to continue to increase the dividend pretty meaningfully here over the next couple of years certainly. Beyond that we've used M&A to drive returns, obviously, over the last several years pretty effectively. We continue to see opportunities to do that. Brocade is the latest example of being able to put capital work and an interesting opportunity that drives better returns than our alternative. So, we're going to continue to do that, but given our scale, we have the opportunity to do that mostly off the balance sheet, particularly with smallest opportunities that arise. William Stein Great. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Vinay Jaising Hello, this is Vinay Jaising calling in for Craig. Thanks for giving the opportunity to ask the question. So, I wanted touch upon carrier aggregation, like this is one of the key growth drivers for RF business. Hock, can you provide us an update on the trends you're seeing by geography for that? And what that means for your portfolio? Hock Tan Okay. Carrier aggregation as you well know is the phenomenon of especially benefiting operators who have multiple spectral bandwidth, not necessarily one but multiple, and interest of reducing CapEx infrastructure is the phenomenon of enabling those bandwidths to max together into one, which creates much more capacity throughput and that's not only in infrastructure, it goes into the phone. And we are probably one of the leading enablers in the phone of making that happen simply because not just of architectural design of the cellular RF analog, but also the fact that FBAR filters which are FBAR, are much better performing and more integral -- have been able to integrate it into a module to allow of that maxing and de-maxing separate spectral bands. And that's happening. It started very aggressively obviously in China continuing to be very much so in China. It's also happening very aggressively in the U.S. Those are the two biggest geographies where a lot of that is happening, started with downlink last year, I think, and it's now moving on to up-linking, not just downlinking, which, of course, then part of reason why it's helping create -- not the only reason, but one of the reasons creating increased content in a cellular RF demand. So, it's great for us and we see that phenomenon continuing to grow and expand into other regions of the world. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, I want to touch upon gross margins. Pretty good performance in gross margin during the quarter and the guidance, but I was thinking about how should we think about gross margins for here? And if you can outline like what are the top two drivers of gross margin expansion as we look out towards rest of fiscal 2017? Hock Tan Okay. Well, it's a very interesting point and as we -- if you look back to a year ago when we just closed the Broadcom transaction every quarter since then, we have been able to expand our gross margin in the range of roughly 40, 50 basis points sequentially. A big part of it is as we settle down the portfolio, as we start to get the benefit of larger scale in purchasing materials and as very specific actions like taking -- basically bringing testing very much in-house and consigning testers to contract manufacturers instead of leasing test time for our huge volume of semiconductor chips. All those various actions -- a lot of a big part of this expansion of gross margin comes from a scale and ability to leverage on the scale in direct materials. It also helps that our product margin as we move from one generation to the other, keeps getting richer in terms of the mix. So, that's a combination of those two things. And in terms of where will it go from here? Frankly, I don't know. Best indicator is probably to look at history. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful, and congrats once again on a good quarter. Hock Tan Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. For my first one you've talked a lot about free cash flow margins, but I wanted to dig a little bit into the payout ratio. You are paying out right now about a little over 30%, target is 50%. Should we think about that sort of level going up to 50% in line with the margins going up to 35% or more? Or like how should we think about the trajectory of reaching your target on the payout ratio that seems like something that's more in your control maybe even quicker than the margins themselves? Tom Krause Well, they kind of go hand-in-hand Stacy. I think what we're going to do and so articulate in the past is we're going to get to the end of the fiscal year, we're going to look back at the free cash flow trajectory on those margins over the course of that previous year. We're going to look at the business; obviously, we're very focused on sustainability. And then we're going to pay out 50%. And so all you are seeing is the general trajectory improving from where we exited last year to where we are here exiting Q1 and guiding Q2. And you're right consistent with the policy as we get to the end of the year where we will achieve expectations that we're going to have -- obviously be in the position to raise that dividend consistent with getting back 50% on an LTM basis. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up I also wanted to dig into gross margins a little bit. You talked a little bit about the drivers, but I heard you say earlier that you're sort of comfortable with your level of OpEx spending as a percentage of revenue, which implies that the operating margin improvement toward the model from here comes from gross margins, but it's not that much, only about 150, maybe 200 basis points from where we are. And this is even before you buy Brocade, which comes in at gross margins in the 70s. so, given all the levers that you just talk about and Brocade coming in, why should 64%, 65%, which is where that would take you -- why should that be the upper limit? Like how should we think about this if we're going farther, I don't see any reason why shouldn't expect gross margins to go even higher than that unless there something else -- mix or something else that ought to be taking it down. Can you talk about that a little bit? Tom Krause Well, Stacy, it's -- actually I think we're going to get into the gross margin where we think we can go and if I go all the way back to the original Avago first margins in the 30s, obviously we're always focused on continuing to improve on our gross margin. I think the second part of the question is we are in our seasonally weak part of the year and so when you do look at the general seasonality of the business and where things are, I think you could take a whole fiscal year approach to looking at where operating margins will land and could land and apply that to how you're thinking about the model. That's the only guidance I'd give you. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Vivek Arya Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the good results and the consistent execution. For my first one, Hock, your Wired business has essentially been in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range for the past year on a quarterly basis. Can you give us some puts and takes on what's done well, what's been different than expectations? Because my rate is that the switching parts has probably done fairly well with all the cloud opportunities, but your broadband access and set-top boxes has perhaps not done so well. But then on the prepared remarks you mentioned you are starting to see a little bit of a pick up on the broadband access side. So, just if you could give us a look back on what was different than expectations? And then as we look forward to this year, could we see contribution from both parts of Wired -- both the cable side as well as the switching side? Hock Tan That's a very interest -- good question actually, very insightful and let me try to explain it on our Wired business. You're right, it's our biggest segment and in simple terms broadly, there are two groups of products here and end markets. There's switching and routing, you correctly put out and that come from various fronts from standard switching and routing, as well ASICs, which is also part in there, as would be building block products as well as fiber optics components. That business is very Enterprise driven directly and has actually done very well even on a year-on-year -- especially on a year-on-year basis because it's growing as we move from 10-gigabit few years ago -- couple of years ago, to increasingly 25 and 100 coming out very fast. As that transition happens very fast, obviously it's driving and you always hear products like Trident going to Tomahawk, especially in the very high end and at Jericho. All these are related to data center switching and that's very, very -- that's driving growth on all infrastructure on a very stable basis, but driving growth very nicely close to high single-digits, even double-digits. Then the other part of the segment, which is pretty big too, is our broadband. And here the set-top box on the CP side and access gateways like DSL/PON on the infrastructure side. And here the business is stable; it's very stable, has been stable for the last couple -- few years and continues to be very stable and it's also very seasonal. And you will see that the later part of second half of the year is typically when it drives up and in the first half of the year is when it shows a seasonal decline. Hence in my opening remarks, I was mentioning that Q1 -- fiscal Q1 is probably a very seasonal low point and it gradually picks up seasonally later part of Q2, but certainly Q3, and then starts rolling over again, but if you look at it year-on-year, relatively very stable. So, we have a confluence of two segments mixed together in our Wired business which is what you're seeing. It dilutes basically the strength, the growth of switching and routing, but nonetheless, both are very franchise product, very franchise business and drives stability in this company. Vivek Arya Thanks Hock. And as my follow-up question, it's a somewhat longer term question. You're obviously doing quite well in the Wireless business and that can continue for some time. The cloud business is also doing quite well. But when I talk with a lot of your peers and ask them about growth in semis over the next three to five years, they talk about connected cars or Internet of Things, or machine learning, or 5G. Do you beer Broadcom is investing adequately to pursue those markets? Is there a part of the company that is looking at those longer term areas? Or do you think M&A is the better way to address some of those things as they become real over time? Thank you. Hock Tan Great question. Giving the opportunity to expand a little propaganda here, again, as we've already articulated. The franchise products we're in, the -- we are the technology; we are also the market leader in those areas. In those niches, some of them are very large niche, but we are the technology leader and we don't get there by not investing. We invested, as my remarks said and I said many times, very heavily in those areas we are in. We develop products that generally in those franchise areas before anybody else do it out there. And that's why we can sustain it, that's why our margins are the way it is because we provide products that allow our customers to differentiate and innovate themselves. So, we invest very heavily and you look at our total R&D, we invest in total $2.7 billion a year as a company in R&D. We're the best engineers out there; we have the best products in this area. So, that's really where we continue to sustain leadership in our existing franchise products. In some of those flights of fantasy somewhat that you covered earlier, we're not -- I'm not saying it won't happen. I will be direct, let somebody else take another hits and then we'll buy the company if it's successful. Thank you. Vivek Arya Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. I had one short-term question and then another longer term question. On the short-term question, with regards to Wireless, you talked about trends at you're Korean customer offsetting the seasonal trends at you're North American customer and therefore you are guiding Q2 to be down only high single-digits relative to history being down about 15%, I recall. Is the upside versus historical seasonality, is that all coming from dynamics at you're Korean customer or dynamics in terms of units or content at your North American customer trending better than history as well? Hock Tan You are really trying to pass the data, aren't you? It's all a combination really. It is -- and you obviously know out there it's also timing of some of the shipments and purchases by our two largest customers. So, there's a bunch of -- a few factors involved in here. One of which was there's timing this quarter differences in timing. There's the fact that you're right, Korean customer is coming in with a vengeance to try to recover share. And broadly, we're also talking about content increases as each new generation comes in and it's not even the Korean customer it's also the major North American customer. And it's a mix of all these factors. Have I sat down and broken it out in detail? No. We don't try to analyze it to that in degree, but those multiple factors mix pull together to basically indicate that the seasonality -- the downward seasonality that we saw a year ago is perhaps less pronounced this year. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, another question on Wireless, specifically around China. Obviously, you're tied to the North American customer and the Korean customer in a big way today, but when you think about your Wireless business and your RF business specifically, on say a three-year view, how do you think about the opportunity in China today? Hock Tan Well, there are opportunities for us in China, and -- but the focus of our success and our product success in Wireless, especially content increases year-on-year is -- as you know, we push the cutting edge on technology. Be it wireless Wi-Fi connectivity or RF cellular, we push the envelope and that tends to go very much largely to the flagship class phones. That top of the pyramid where a big part of it has been our major North American customer and Korean customer, plus a few other guys spread around. That's where our strength is, that's where the demand and value seen our products can have. As China evolve over time, having said that, the opportunity exists, they will move from feature phones to low-end smartphones to now some premium phones. And we begin to get traction on even those premium phones to the extent that those brands in China use it, and that's why we need the technological engineering edge that we provide in the products. Until then, they need less of it. Except -- with exceptions like carrier aggregation when we obviously are the leader in providing solutions for carrier aggregation on a discrete basis. But on an integrated basis into smartphones, it's really the flagship phones and now increasingly premium phones making its way into flagship phones that we see the demand. And that transition is happening in China, albeit, on a very gradual basis, but we're very patient people, we'll wait for it. Unidentified Analyst Thank you. Operator And our last question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for sneaking me and congratulations. Hock, my first question is kind of a follow-up on the Enterprise Storage side. You rightfully pointed out that today, the SSD controller businesses is the smallest part of that business. I'm kind pf curious as you look out over time, do you see that market developing similar and potentially getting to be the size of the HDD controller market? Or is there something inherent about the growing complexity of raw NAND itself, which means there will always be a large portion of that controller market which is insourced, the guys building demand actually building their own controller. Do you think eventually you will end up in situation where it's all outsourced? Hock Tan That's a very insightful question and we see the SSD controllers for Enterprise to be a lot of it will be outsourced. Why? Because there are certain IP inherent in those Enterprise flash controllers that are very tricky to do. Not dissimilar from the re-channel of hard disk drives, so that will happen. [Indiscernible], because the nature of [Indiscernible], it's not so complex technology, IP required is not so extreme. We see that as probably less opportunistic for us, though one never knows. But certainly on Enterprise, which is where we are very focused on, we see a lot of need for intellectual property blocks features that few people can do. And we are one of those few people who can do it very well. John Pitzer That's helpful. And then, Hock, as my follow-up, I think a lot of us in the investment community understand the Wireless, both on the RF and on the connectivity side, the content ASP story. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that same dynamic in your Wired business. And maybe differentiate between switching and routing versus set-top box and broadband access? How do we think about the ASP trends in those two segments over time? Or just your content going into the CapEx dollars being spent in the Wired market? Hock Tan Well, if you talk about switching and routing, it's really more than just chips -- building blocks of chips. It's really as much an architectural play, especially in the high end top of the rack, in the [Indiscernible] and the spine side of the data centers. And here is where our model just goes beyond selling pieces of silicon; we sell a lot of firmware and software that goes hand in hand to enable those chips to work with multiple OEM customers at the end of the day. So, that's a very interesting model for us and what is overriding all of this is obviously the need for more larger and larger more and more throughput, especially, in data centers, and especially in top of the rack and all the way to the spine. So, we have big advantages in this area simply because of the strength of the intellectual property we have in making very complex engineering, very complex SoCs, but also interface very high-speed interfaces or [Indiscernible] as we call it. So, all that plays to our advantage of being able to do it. And we continue to do that, and we continue to -- it goes from 10-gigabit to 25 to 50 to 100 and maybe -- and going on in the future to 200-gigabit to 400-gigabit. We believe we are investing heavily to ensure that we can develop those kind of products and develop it first and better than anybody else. So, -- and with that expansion of features, we benefit from content increases, simply because you are providing a customer more throughput and it's not a one-on-one scaling, it's more and more -- it's a lot of value for our customers to be able to go from 25-gigabit -- or 10-gigabit to 100 in the next year or two and we provide a lot of value in that. And by the way, in broadband, it's not dissimilar. Except that maybe it's not evolving as rapidly simply because it's a much more stable market, for instance, you hear about now 4K TVs video delivery to moving on to high definition, HD, and eventually moving even to 8K. That would be interesting to see how 8K is going to be accepted since the human eye may not even notice the difference, but people want it. And they want that, we're able to provide that. But it might take a bit longer, that's why I said broadband to us is a much -- we look at it as a much more stable gradually evolving market, even as OTT, the hype behind OTT and all that comes play which we participate in. But in data centers, it's serious stuff. More and more data are being basically pushed through pipes stored, processed as social media keeps expanding. And that's why we are seeing this past quarter and current quarter extraordinary strength in the demand for switching and routing. John Pitzer That's great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore Hey guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess Hock the first question is on the Wireless side. It's good to see the content rising at other customers besides just your big North American customer; can you talk a little bit more detail about what's driving that content up? Is there anything unique or is it basically the same goodness that you've seen in the North America side? And any more color about that goodness continuing on the North America side into the second half of this year would also be helpful. Thanks. Hock Tan Yes, Ross thanks for the question. Yes, it's -- in fact it's a phenomenon we have been indicating to you guys for the last several years which is over the medium term -- long-term, I would say, our strength of franchise in cellular and our RF cellular analog, the front end cellular analog, which includes FBAR and power amplifiers and all the circuitry and component that goes in front of the transceiver in the handset for cellular. That's one area and the other area in Wi-Fi Bluetooth connectivity. Those two functionality, those two features in phones continue to evolve and with each generation. And as each generation evolves, when it involves, in the case of RF cellular is two-fold. One is basically more band as we progress -- as more and more countries globally progress into 4G and eventually even further beyond that. More and more bands -- spectral bandwidths get pulled into the fold and number of skills of phones get less and less for any major OEM manufacturer simply because of complexity of these phones. And so because of more bands, it requires more filters, more components like power amplifiers -- low noise amplifiers and because of that necessary content increases. I should also add the difficulty of engineering those products increased fairly exponentially, which therefore drives towards better and better content for us into those very high-end flagship smartphones. In the case of wireless connectivity, the same phenomenon is happening and it's particularly driven on bandwidth on the peer [ph] throughput as we move from -- what we gradually move from what used to be much lower bandwidth in Wi-Fi to today's AC. As we move from to single users to multiple users and as we move next generation from AC into AX and further. Obviously, difficulty of doing those products in smartphones become correspondingly more difficult, content increases and we benefit from basically content increase. It's a normal phenomenon and we expect to see that continuing into the medium term. Ross Seymore Great, that's helpful. I guess for my one follow-up, both you and Tom, Hock, mentioned about the 15% growth not being your long-term assumption. Just wondering why you are bringing that up? Is there something you're seeing now that gives you pause that things are going to slow down or is this just a reminder that the level we are now is not the base assumption in your business model? Hock Tan I think the fairest way to answer that is we have articulated last fiscal year very clearly and even a year ago when we acquired Broadcom, as long as a year ago, that we were scaled and we were diversification of product portfolio. Our long-term model, out five years, 10 years is a compounded annual growth of 5%. Not every year necessarily, but long-term 5%. And why we feel the need to mention it is obviously you saw the numbers we were guiding for Q2 on the topline and they're showing 15% year-on-year from a year ago. That's just one quarter and obviously just one fiscal year, one point in time. So, we felt it necessary to just mention it that do not just take it and extrapolate it to say that we have move away from our broad model on guidance of 5% compounded annual growth in the long term to a 15%, far from it. Tom Krause And Ross, I mean just to add -- I also want to reiterate, we don't believe we need to have this accelerated revenue growth to hit our financial targets which we remain very focused on, specifically the free cash flow margins at 35%. We're very comfortable achieving those results based on a more normalized long-term CAGR of mid-single-digits. Ross Seymore Very well. Congrats on those results. Thanks a lot. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis Hey guys thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results. Just following-up on the Wireless guide, you've talked in the past sometimes it can be seasonal down 15%, 20% to the high single-digits. Just curious between contents and the units, what are you seeing with your two large customers in terms of the seasonality and the timing of the ramp magnitude versus the content gains you're seeing? Hock Tan To be -- I don't have specific data between to be able to speed out accurately between units and content, but off the cuff, my sense is it's largely content. Blayne Curtis Okay. And then you mentioned strength in switching, I was curious obviously you don't want to -- for a full year, I was just curious you talked about some businesses being soft in the second half. There's obviously a big upgrade cycle that's 2500G. Just curious your perspective as you look at the rest of the year the trajectory of the switch business? Hock Tan That's a very interesting question and on the switching side, which is a subset, obviously, of our Wired segment, which is our largest segment, but just if you look at our switching and routing sites, fair way to put it together, which is really data center networking business, we continue to see strength through the rest of the year. We see -- a big part of that strength we see is simply because of a very strong data center demand -- data center buildup by the cloud operators. We're seeing that now and I suspect that phenomenon will still continue, particularly when we start to ramp-up newer generation with high-bandwidth of Tomahawks and Tridents and as we go later part in the year of our DMX router and aggregation switches. So, we see that and this momentum to be fairly good based on demand -- intrinsic demand out there in data center expansion, especially into the cloud, but also from the fact that we're launching a few very key new products in this year. Blayne Curtis Thanks. Hock Tan Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question and it's great to see the diversity in the business playing out here. On the strong growth in the storage business that I'm assuming some of this is your SSD product lines; I believe you guys are supplying Enterprise SSD controllers into the top two enterprising cloud SSD suppliers. And I think your top customer here just grew their Enterprise SSD business I think 20% sequentially and 20% year-over-year in the December quarter. Wondering if you guys are seeing similar growth trends? And do you expect double-digit growth in the SSD segment for the full year? Hock Tan I'll be [Indiscernible] our visibility in the SSDs are not as good as perhaps our customers are. A big part of it is there are three parts to our Enterprise Storage, three broad parts, one is very related to storage server connectivity, that's the rate part and the Fiber Channel whole part side of it rate. And then there is the components we ship into hard disk drives. And hard disk drive has experience as you well know a strong surge over the last several months probably because flash have been in short supply. And the last and smallest part of our business in Enterprise Storage is really related to Enterprise flash controllers for SSD. And that's really a small part. So, we don't get that broad visibility into this SSD market as a lot of other people would. But you're, right now, it's very, very strong and especially in SAS. Harlan Sur Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then off of the success of Tomahawks and I also hear that your prior generation Trident is still very strong as well and the team is ramping into this upgrade cycle, but you started sampling Tomahawk II, I think it was second half of last year. Can you just give us an update on the qualification, customer feedback, and when should we see the adoption curve for T2 starting to ramp, is that going to be kind of 2018 timeframe? Hock Tan For very competitive reasons I really hate to give you specifics here. Suffice to say it's very well received. We have a lot of momentum on our entire switch portfolio. And by the way as Tomahawk doesn't fully replace Trident, Trident is using a different segment versus Tomahawk and both are going very well as are the Jericho products, which are more aggregation switching and routing. So, broadly our portfolio of -- from high end down to even low range -- on the low-end range of switching -- campus switching pointers [ph], those are all going very well. And I suspect it's all largely due to the strength in data center spending that still receive continue, particularly more recently since we had very strong conversion of Enterprises into the cloud. Harlan Sur Thanks Hock. Operator Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on the very strong results and outlook. I wanted to address the free cash flow margin trajectory. Tom I think you referred to some of this in your prepared remarks, but I'd like you to maybe highlight what aside from the restructuring expenses that are still being paid and the temporarily higher CapEx that you are experiencing, what are the other drivers to get you to the 35% free cash flow margin? And what sort of timing should we think about for that? Tom Krause William good question and I think that's sort of the point of the prepared remarks. And if you look at where we are from an operating margin perspective, you look at the fact we restructured the balance sheet around now fixed rate debt. If you look at our sustainable tax rate of 4.5% and cash taxes of approximately $100 million a quarter and you take out the restructuring costs, which are bleeding off here pretty quickly, you take out the one-time campus initiative, the one-time tester initiative this year which will sort of play itself out over the next couple of quarters. Frankly, we're largely there. And that's probably the real takeaway and of course that doesn't take into account what we would expect to be the second half seasonally up trends from a revenue perspective. William Stein It's helpful. Appreciate it. Maybe one more. Something that came up last quarter was the change in capital allocation strategy. Maybe you can sort of highlight for us your plans on the M&A front from here despite the higher dividend -- the significantly higher free cash flow that you are going to be generating I guess after these temporary expenses falloff would seem to meet to continue to support a good M&A pipeline. Maybe you can characterize for us please? Tom Krause Yes, I mean there's no real uptick there other than we outlined very clearly that we're going to continue to drive given back 50% of free cash flows to investors in the form of dividends, which, of course, at these levels, would imply that we're going to have the ability to continue to increase the dividend pretty meaningfully here over the next couple of years certainly. Beyond that we've used M&A to drive returns, obviously, over the last several years pretty effectively. We continue to see opportunities to do that. Brocade is the latest example of being able to put capital work and an interesting opportunity that drives better returns than our alternative. So, we're going to continue to do that, but given our scale, we have the opportunity to do that mostly off the balance sheet, particularly with smallest opportunities that arise. William Stein Great. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Vinay Jaising Hello, this is Vinay Jaising calling in for Craig. Thanks for giving the opportunity to ask the question. So, I wanted touch upon carrier aggregation, like this is one of the key growth drivers for RF business. Hock, can you provide us an update on the trends you're seeing by geography for that? And what that means for your portfolio? Hock Tan Okay. Carrier aggregation as you well know is the phenomenon of especially benefiting operators who have multiple spectral bandwidth, not necessarily one but multiple, and interest of reducing CapEx infrastructure is the phenomenon of enabling those bandwidths to max together into one, which creates much more capacity throughput and that's not only in infrastructure, it goes into the phone. And we are probably one of the leading enablers in the phone of making that happen simply because not just of architectural design of the cellular RF analog, but also the fact that FBAR filters which are FBAR, are much better performing and more integral -- have been able to integrate it into a module to allow of that maxing and de-maxing separate spectral bands. And that's happening. It started very aggressively obviously in China continuing to be very much so in China. It's also happening very aggressively in the U.S. Those are the two biggest geographies where a lot of that is happening, started with downlink last year, I think, and it's now moving on to up-linking, not just downlinking, which, of course, then part of reason why it's helping create -- not the only reason, but one of the reasons creating increased content in a cellular RF demand. So, it's great for us and we see that phenomenon continuing to grow and expand into other regions of the world. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, I want to touch upon gross margins. Pretty good performance in gross margin during the quarter and the guidance, but I was thinking about how should we think about gross margins for here? And if you can outline like what are the top two drivers of gross margin expansion as we look out towards rest of fiscal 2017? Hock Tan Okay. Well, it's a very interesting point and as we -- if you look back to a year ago when we just closed the Broadcom transaction every quarter since then, we have been able to expand our gross margin in the range of roughly 40, 50 basis points sequentially. A big part of it is as we settle down the portfolio, as we start to get the benefit of larger scale in purchasing materials and as very specific actions like taking -- basically bringing testing very much in-house and consigning testers to contract manufacturers instead of leasing test time for our huge volume of semiconductor chips. All those various actions -- a lot of a big part of this expansion of gross margin comes from a scale and ability to leverage on the scale in direct materials. It also helps that our product margin as we move from one generation to the other, keeps getting richer in terms of the mix. So, that's a combination of those two things. And in terms of where will it go from here? Frankly, I don't know. Best indicator is probably to look at history. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful, and congrats once again on a good quarter. Hock Tan Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. For my first one you've talked a lot about free cash flow margins, but I wanted to dig a little bit into the payout ratio. You are paying out right now about a little over 30%, target is 50%. Should we think about that sort of level going up to 50% in line with the margins going up to 35% or more? Or like how should we think about the trajectory of reaching your target on the payout ratio that seems like something that's more in your control maybe even quicker than the margins themselves? Tom Krause Well, they kind of go hand-in-hand Stacy. I think what we're going to do and so articulate in the past is we're going to get to the end of the fiscal year, we're going to look back at the free cash flow trajectory on those margins over the course of that previous year. We're going to look at the business; obviously, we're very focused on sustainability. And then we're going to pay out 50%. And so all you are seeing is the general trajectory improving from where we exited last year to where we are here exiting Q1 and guiding Q2. And you're right consistent with the policy as we get to the end of the year where we will achieve expectations that we're going to have -- obviously be in the position to raise that dividend consistent with getting back 50% on an LTM basis. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up I also wanted to dig into gross margins a little bit. You talked a little bit about the drivers, but I heard you say earlier that you're sort of comfortable with your level of OpEx spending as a percentage of revenue, which implies that the operating margin improvement toward the model from here comes from gross margins, but it's not that much, only about 150, maybe 200 basis points from where we are. And this is even before you buy Brocade, which comes in at gross margins in the 70s. so, given all the levers that you just talk about and Brocade coming in, why should 64%, 65%, which is where that would take you -- why should that be the upper limit? Like how should we think about this if we're going farther, I don't see any reason why shouldn't expect gross margins to go even higher than that unless there something else -- mix or something else that ought to be taking it down. Can you talk about that a little bit? Tom Krause Well, Stacy, it's -- actually I think we're going to get into the gross margin where we think we can go and if I go all the way back to the original Avago first margins in the 30s, obviously we're always focused on continuing to improve on our gross margin. I think the second part of the question is we are in our seasonally weak part of the year and so when you do look at the general seasonality of the business and where things are, I think you could take a whole fiscal year approach to looking at where operating margins will land and could land and apply that to how you're thinking about the model. That's the only guidance I'd give you. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Vivek Arya Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the good results and the consistent execution. For my first one, Hock, your Wired business has essentially been in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range for the past year on a quarterly basis. Can you give us some puts and takes on what's done well, what's been different than expectations? Because my rate is that the switching parts has probably done fairly well with all the cloud opportunities, but your broadband access and set-top boxes has perhaps not done so well. But then on the prepared remarks you mentioned you are starting to see a little bit of a pick up on the broadband access side. So, just if you could give us a look back on what was different than expectations? And then as we look forward to this year, could we see contribution from both parts of Wired -- both the cable side as well as the switching side? Hock Tan That's a very interest -- good question actually, very insightful and let me try to explain it on our Wired business. You're right, it's our biggest segment and in simple terms broadly, there are two groups of products here and end markets. There's switching and routing, you correctly put out and that come from various fronts from standard switching and routing, as well ASICs, which is also part in there, as would be building block products as well as fiber optics components. That business is very Enterprise driven directly and has actually done very well even on a year-on-year -- especially on a year-on-year basis because it's growing as we move from 10-gigabit few years ago -- couple of years ago, to increasingly 25 and 100 coming out very fast. As that transition happens very fast, obviously it's driving and you always hear products like Trident going to Tomahawk, especially in the very high end and at Jericho. All these are related to data center switching and that's very, very -- that's driving growth on all infrastructure on a very stable basis, but driving growth very nicely close to high single-digits, even double-digits. Then the other part of the segment, which is pretty big too, is our broadband. And here the set-top box on the CP side and access gateways like DSL/PON on the infrastructure side. And here the business is stable; it's very stable, has been stable for the last couple -- few years and continues to be very stable and it's also very seasonal. And you will see that the later part of second half of the year is typically when it drives up and in the first half of the year is when it shows a seasonal decline. Hence in my opening remarks, I was mentioning that Q1 -- fiscal Q1 is probably a very seasonal low point and it gradually picks up seasonally later part of Q2, but certainly Q3, and then starts rolling over again, but if you look at it year-on-year, relatively very stable. So, we have a confluence of two segments mixed together in our Wired business which is what you're seeing. It dilutes basically the strength, the growth of switching and routing, but nonetheless, both are very franchise product, very franchise business and drives stability in this company. Vivek Arya Thanks Hock. And as my follow-up question, it's a somewhat longer term question. You're obviously doing quite well in the Wireless business and that can continue for some time. The cloud business is also doing quite well. But when I talk with a lot of your peers and ask them about growth in semis over the next three to five years, they talk about connected cars or Internet of Things, or machine learning, or 5G. Do you beer Broadcom is investing adequately to pursue those markets? Is there a part of the company that is looking at those longer term areas? Or do you think M&A is the better way to address some of those things as they become real over time? Thank you. Hock Tan Great question. Giving the opportunity to expand a little propaganda here, again, as we've already articulated. The franchise products we're in, the -- we are the technology; we are also the market leader in those areas. In those niches, some of them are very large niche, but we are the technology leader and we don't get there by not investing. We invested, as my remarks said and I said many times, very heavily in those areas we are in. We develop products that generally in those franchise areas before anybody else do it out there. And that's why we can sustain it, that's why our margins are the way it is because we provide products that allow our customers to differentiate and innovate themselves. So, we invest very heavily and you look at our total R&D, we invest in total $2.7 billion a year as a company in R&D. We're the best engineers out there; we have the best products in this area. So, that's really where we continue to sustain leadership in our existing franchise products. In some of those flights of fantasy somewhat that you covered earlier, we're not -- I'm not saying it won't happen. I will be direct, let somebody else take another hits and then we'll buy the company if it's successful. Thank you. Vivek Arya Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. I had one short-term question and then another longer term question. On the short-term question, with regards to Wireless, you talked about trends at you're Korean customer offsetting the seasonal trends at you're North American customer and therefore you are guiding Q2 to be down only high single-digits relative to history being down about 15%, I recall. Is the upside versus historical seasonality, is that all coming from dynamics at you're Korean customer or dynamics in terms of units or content at your North American customer trending better than history as well? Hock Tan You are really trying to pass the data, aren't you? It's all a combination really. It is -- and you obviously know out there it's also timing of some of the shipments and purchases by our two largest customers. So, there's a bunch of -- a few factors involved in here. One of which was there's timing this quarter differences in timing. There's the fact that you're right, Korean customer is coming in with a vengeance to try to recover share. And broadly, we're also talking about content increases as each new generation comes in and it's not even the Korean customer it's also the major North American customer. And it's a mix of all these factors. Have I sat down and broken it out in detail? No. We don't try to analyze it to that in degree, but those multiple factors mix pull together to basically indicate that the seasonality -- the downward seasonality that we saw a year ago is perhaps less pronounced this year. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, another question on Wireless, specifically around China. Obviously, you're tied to the North American customer and the Korean customer in a big way today, but when you think about your Wireless business and your RF business specifically, on say a three-year view, how do you think about the opportunity in China today? Hock Tan Well, there are opportunities for us in China, and -- but the focus of our success and our product success in Wireless, especially content increases year-on-year is -- as you know, we push the cutting edge on technology. Be it wireless Wi-Fi connectivity or RF cellular, we push the envelope and that tends to go very much largely to the flagship class phones. That top of the pyramid where a big part of it has been our major North American customer and Korean customer, plus a few other guys spread around. That's where our strength is, that's where the demand and value seen our products can have. As China evolve over time, having said that, the opportunity exists, they will move from feature phones to low-end smartphones to now some premium phones. And we begin to get traction on even those premium phones to the extent that those brands in China use it, and that's why we need the technological engineering edge that we provide in the products. Until then, they need less of it. Except -- with exceptions like carrier aggregation when we obviously are the leader in providing solutions for carrier aggregation on a discrete basis. But on an integrated basis into smartphones, it's really the flagship phones and now increasingly premium phones making its way into flagship phones that we see the demand. And that transition is happening in China, albeit, on a very gradual basis, but we're very patient people, we'll wait for it. Unidentified Analyst Thank you. Operator And our last question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for sneaking me and congratulations. Hock, my first question is kind of a follow-up on the Enterprise Storage side. You rightfully pointed out that today, the SSD controller businesses is the smallest part of that business. I'm kind pf curious as you look out over time, do you see that market developing similar and potentially getting to be the size of the HDD controller market? Or is there something inherent about the growing complexity of raw NAND itself, which means there will always be a large portion of that controller market which is insourced, the guys building demand actually building their own controller. Do you think eventually you will end up in situation where it's all outsourced? Hock Tan That's a very insightful question and we see the SSD controllers for Enterprise to be a lot of it will be outsourced. Why? Because there are certain IP inherent in those Enterprise flash controllers that are very tricky to do. Not dissimilar from the re-channel of hard disk drives, so that will happen. [Indiscernible], because the nature of [Indiscernible], it's not so complex technology, IP required is not so extreme. We see that as probably less opportunistic for us, though one never knows. But certainly on Enterprise, which is where we are very focused on, we see a lot of need for intellectual property blocks features that few people can do. And we are one of those few people who can do it very well. John Pitzer That's helpful. And then, Hock, as my follow-up, I think a lot of us in the investment community understand the Wireless, both on the RF and on the connectivity side, the content ASP story. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that same dynamic in your Wired business. And maybe differentiate between switching and routing versus set-top box and broadband access? How do we think about the ASP trends in those two segments over time? Or just your content going into the CapEx dollars being spent in the Wired market? Hock Tan Well, if you talk about switching and routing, it's really more than just chips -- building blocks of chips. It's really as much an architectural play, especially in the high end top of the rack, in the [Indiscernible] and the spine side of the data centers. And here is where our model just goes beyond selling pieces of silicon; we sell a lot of firmware and software that goes hand in hand to enable those chips to work with multiple OEM customers at the end of the day. So, that's a very interesting model for us and what is overriding all of this is obviously the need for more larger and larger more and more throughput, especially, in data centers, and especially in top of the rack and all the way to the spine. So, we have big advantages in this area simply because of the strength of the intellectual property we have in making very complex engineering, very complex SoCs, but also interface very high-speed interfaces or [Indiscernible] as we call it. So, all that plays to our advantage of being able to do it. And we continue to do that, and we continue to -- it goes from 10-gigabit to 25 to 50 to 100 and maybe -- and going on in the future to 200-gigabit to 400-gigabit. We believe we are investing heavily to ensure that we can develop those kind of products and develop it first and better than anybody else. So, -- and with that expansion of features, we benefit from content increases, simply because you are providing a customer more throughput and it's not a one-on-one scaling, it's more and more -- it's a lot of value for our customers to be able to go from 25-gigabit -- or 10-gigabit to 100 in the next year or two and we provide a lot of value in that. And by the way, in broadband, it's not dissimilar. Except that maybe it's not evolving as rapidly simply because it's a much more stable market, for instance, you hear about now 4K TVs video delivery to moving on to high definition, HD, and eventually moving even to 8K. That would be interesting to see how 8K is going to be accepted since the human eye may not even notice the difference, but people want it. And they want that, we're able to provide that. But it might take a bit longer, that's why I said broadband to us is a much -- we look at it as a much more stable gradually evolving market, even as OTT, the hype behind OTT and all that comes play which we participate in. But in data centers, it's serious stuff. More and more data are being basically pushed through pipes stored, processed as social media keeps expanding. And that's why we are seeing this past quarter and current quarter extraordinary strength in the demand for switching and routing. John Pitzer That's great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ashish Saran, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ashish Saran Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Limited. After market close today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. If you did not receive a cope, you may obtain the information from the Investor section of Broadcom’s website at www.broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be made available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investor section of our website at broadcom.com. During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our second quarter year 2017 results, background to our third quarter fiscal year 2017 outlook, and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today’s press release. Comments made during today’s call will primarily refer to are non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. At this time, I would like to turn the call over the Hock Tan. Hock? Hock Tan Thank you, Ashish, good afternoon everyone. I'm actually quite pleased with our performance for the second fiscal quarter with solid contributions from a broad number of our franchises. We delivered strong financial results with revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share, all above the top line -- top end of our guidance. Second quarter revenue of $4.2 billion, grew 1% sequentially and 18% year-on-year. The seasonal sequential decline in our Wireless segment was less than expected and more than offset by contributions from all other segments. All segments, even wireless delivered year-on-year revenue growth. On the income front, earnings per share were $3.69, growing by 2% sequentially and 46% year-on-year.  Let me now turn the discussion of our results by segment. Starting with Wired, our largest segment. In the second quarter, Wired revenue was very stable at $2.1 billion, growing 1% sequentially and 3% year-on-year. The Wired segment represented 50% of our total revenue. Wired continued to remain a very consistent end market and performed in line with expectations. As you may recall, in the preceding quarter, Wired revenue included approximately $16 million of revenue related to the assignment of certain manufacturers right to a customer. This did not repeat in the second quarter; however, we were able to more than make up for this amount with growth- from enterprise networking and start of a seasonal increase in demand for our broadband access and set-top box products. Turning to the third fiscal quarter, though we expect seasonal strength in broadband and sustain cloud data center spend, and consistent with this outlook, we expect Wired revenue growth to accelerate into mid-single digits sequentially. Moving onto Wireless. Second quarter, Wireless revenue was $1.15 billion, declining by 2% sequentially, but growing 45% year-on-year. The Wireless segment represented 28% of our total revenue. The low-single-digit sequential decline in revenue was better than expected due to stronger than anticipated end-market demand. The sequential decline was driven by the bottom of the annual product cycle transition at our major North American customer, offset by the ramp of the next generation phone at our large Korean smartphone customer. Generation to generation, we also benefited from significant increase in Broadcom cellular and WiFi connectivity content. Moving on now to the third quarter. We expect to see the beginning of the second half seasonal growth in our Wireless segment revenue. We expect this growth to be driven by the start of a ramp from a large North American smartphone customer as they transition to their next generation platform. On top of this, we are also expecting a substantial increase in our total dollar content from the eight Broadcom products we will be supplying into this new platform. The national ramp of this next generation platform; however, appears slower this year, compared to prior years. But we believe, this will likely accelerate in our fourth quarter. Our third fiscal quarter outlook reflects this expectation and notwithstanding the 40% content growth. We project sequential growth in our Wireless revenue to only approach double digits on a percentage basis. This outlook also reflects an expected decline in shipments to our last Korean smartphone customers. Let me now turn to Enterprise Storage. In the second quarter, Enterprise Storage revenue was $712 million, growing 1% sequentially and 36% year-on-year. Storage segment represented 17% of our total revenue. Surprisingly, this segment continued to hold up and perform as expected. Hard disk drive and custom SSD shipments grew while SaaS and RAID sustained, offset by a seasonal decline in Fiber Channel shipments. During our previous earnings call, we express a cautionary tone around enterprise storage for the third quarter; however, we continued to see stability in most of all sustain bookings. We expect storage revenue to grow in the low-single digit sequentially into the third quarter. And finally, our last segment Industrial. In the second quarter, the Industrial segment revenue was $223 million, growing by 24% sequentially, much better than expected primarily due to higher IP, intellectual properties that is licensing revenue from a large deal we closed in the quarter. Industrial revenue grew 23% year-on-year and represented 5% of our total revenue. Re-sales of our industrial products continued to trend up very firmly in the second quarter, and we expect this to continue to be strong into the next quarter. As we look to the third quarter, we expect Industrial revenue to grow in the mid-single digits sequentially. So in summary, demand in the second quarter, historically our weakest seasonal quarter, was stronger than expected. For the third fiscal quarter, end markets in Wired, Enterprise, Storage, and Industrial continues to be strong, while wireless turns out and starts a slower than usual seasonal second half ramp , although, we do expect it to accelerate dramatically in the fourth quarter. This leads to up projection of consolidated revenue growth of around 6% sequentially for the third quarter. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom for more detailed review of our second quarter financials and third quarter outlook. Tom Krause Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP days is included in the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at broacom.com. For the second quarter, starting with the revenue of $4.2 billion, which grew by 1% sequentially. Year-on-year, growth for the second quarter revenue was 18%, which I would notice continues to be well ahead of our long-term growth rate targets of mid-single digits. Foxconn was only the greater than 10% direct customer in the second fiscal quarter. Our second quarter gross margins from continuing operations were 63.1%, 70 basis points higher than our prior quarter and 110 basis points above the midpoint of guidance. The improvement in gross margins is primarily due to higher revenue and better than expected IP licensing revenue within our industrial and other segment. I would note, we do expect to be able to sustain these gross margins going forward. Turning to operating expenses, R&D expenses were 677 million and SG&A expenses were $122 million, totaling 799 million or 19% of net revenue for the second quarter. This was slightly higher than guidance as we accrued for a larger projected annual bonus compensation expense, driven by better than expected operating income. As I mentioned last quarter, we are comfortable at this relative level of operating expense given our current portfolio of businesses. Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.85 billion and represented 44.1% of net revenue. We now have line of sight to achieving our long-term operating margin target of 45%. Provisions for taxes came in at $78 million slightly above our guidance. This is primarily due to higher than expected net income. Second quarter interest expense was a 112 million and other income net was 3 million. Second quarter net income was 1.67 billion and earnings per diluted share was $3.69. Our share based compensation expense in the second quarter was 216 million. Moving onto the balance sheet, our day sales outstanding were 45 days, an increase of two days from the prior quarter due to a reduction in linearity of revenue in the quarter. Our inventory ended at 1.31 billion, a decrease of 25 million from the beginning of the quarter. We generated 1.58 billion in operational cash flow, which does include the impact of an increase in working capital. Expenditures on classic Broadcom restructuring integration activities continues to decline as expected, as we expanded approximately $50 million in cash on these activities in the second quarter. Free cash flow in the second quarter was 1.33 billion or 32% of net revenue. I would note, we are making very good progress towards our long-term target of 35%. Capital expenditure in the second quarter was 256 million or 6.1% of net revenue. As a reminder, we do expect our long-term CapEx to decline to about 3% of net revenue. A total of 437 million in cash was spent on company dividend and partnership distribution payments in the second quarter. We ended the second quarter with cash and short-term investment balance of 4.45 billion. Our cash balance is running at elevated levels, which we expect will continue through the third quarter anticipation of close and depending acquisition of Brocade. Now, let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. Net revenue is expected to be 4.45 billion plus or minus 75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 63%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately 787 million. Our tax provision is forecasted to be approximately 86 million. The net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately 100 million. Note, this reflects anticipated interest expense on our long-term debt of 112 million offset, largely by other income including interest earned on our cash balance. The diluted share count forecast is for 456 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately 255 million. Capital expenditure will be approximately 240 million. As you have seen, our Board has declared a dividend of $1.02 per share to be paid later in this fiscal -- third fiscal quarter. We’re looking forward to completing the acquisition of Brocade, which is proceeding as planned and subject to the satisfaction off the remaining closing conditions. We presently expect to close this transaction on or about July 31, 2017. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open. Blayne Curtis Just want to follow up on the Wireless side you said it’s slow ramp . I was just kind of curious, is this the timing or magnitude? I think you have meant that it’s going to be more in Q4, but if maybe you could just wrap some color around that? Hock Tan It’s timing. I think, it is timing; last year, the similar ramp was earlier -- was stronger in Q3 probably because it was earlier. And here the initial volume in our fiscal Q2 was smaller, made up with content on our side, but definitely Q4 is forecasted to be larger. Blayne Curtis And then, you mentioned this from the Storage side, you had some conservatism on the second half and you're seeing growth. Maybe if you can just talk about, what you're seeing on the Storage side that is growing? And then, what are you seeing. I think the hard drives where you're most concerned, what’s making you feel better about that market? Hock Tan Well, it's growing -- it’s growing as we mentioned pretty much single digit, low-single digit. I would say it's at a high elevated level and kind of staying there for now in Q3. Q4 of course as we expressed in a cautionary manner is a whole new game. Visibility is -- obviously, we are not booking everything in Q4 here, but we pretty booked Q3. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Vivek Arya  Thanks for taking my question and great job on consistent execution. So my first question Hock, can you please address these recent media reports about the potentially large bit for Toshiba's assets? I realized the details are not public, but there is a very large amount of money involved. And I think investors are keen to know how you're thinking about it conceptually and whether you are still committed to being disciplined around maintaining your free cash flow returns and not taking big technology risks when you consider M&A. Hock Tan We are very committed to our business model of only having franchises, very much though. And as I mentioned, all 18 of our product lines are product franchises in connectivity solutions. We are also very committed to not only those franchises but generating lots and lots of free cash flow which we top of -- which we will return to shareholder. All that up on model, no change. Bottom line, don't believe everything you read out there, please. Vivek Arya  I see. And then secondly on the Wireless business, I think you gave some good color for Q3. Just one question on Q4 and then maybe longer term, Q4 when I look in the last 5 years, the median sort of sequential growth has been close to 30%. So, is that the kind of level that you're thinking about this year or maybe even better given the delayed shipments of those phones and a higher content you've suggested? And then longer term on that same Wireless theme, I think one of your competitors, Qorvo recently outlined some plans to perhaps take some share at your large customer with the High Band PAD. And I wanted to see, how secure you think your competitive position is on next year's phone models? Thank you. Hock Tan There is a lot of questions and content. I’ll start with the serious one. We don't forecast beyond one quarter you know, bad practice frankly because we could be very sadly wrong. But obviously, what we are also seeing is from the limited visibility we see, we see the ramp beginning in our fiscal Q3 which as you know is an off calendar ramp by one month, July. So, we captured a part of that ramp, we believe it is a small part, and we expect to capture the substantial part of that ramp in Q4. But keep in mind always when you compare year-on-year, we have different content levels from a year ago substantial as I pointed out. So, that my kind of confused the numbers somewhat. But suffice to say, Q3 as we outlined since the beginning of the ramp may not be the same level of ramp if you compare to a year ago for the couple of reasons I mentioned. But we also see Q4 to even ramp up, even more substantially obviously because if Q3 is slower, it’s more than likely Q4 in any product ramp would just show a stronger quarter compared to Q3. So, that said, but other -- the specifics really, I am not really at liberty to disclose it because we just don’t go look that far out. As far as the trash talk you hear out there, seriously, we don’t prefer to -- I prefer not to comment on that. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig Hettenbach Thanks. I have just follow-up on Wireless on the content side. Can you give maybe a little bit of context, if you split kind of the legacy of Viago and RF relative to the Broadcom kind of connectivity and maybe touch piece? Hock Tan I am already stretching a lot to say, there is a certain North American customer. We have very good content to customer we daily value. I prefer not to give you any more details other than that. Thank you. Craig Hettenbach Okay. I’ll try another one on the networking side. Can you talk about just the trajectory in the merchant silicon business and any new kind of customer adoptions or ramps to think about there? Hock Tan Well, we feel very good about our merchant silicon in switching and now routing as we call it, which is the DNX series and the Jericho, Jericho plus all the -- and we have launched that. And their use not just -- its routers, they use as aggregation switching in the spine. And so, it’s a very good aggregation, solidly much cover in our merchant silicon even at the high performance, high competitive top of the rack switching. We pretty much cover a full range of requirements. And so that’s going to alone very well. In fact, as of penetration especially in the cloud guys is very, very good. Adoption among the hyper-scale cloud guys is extremely strong, extremely well used. And well, all this is going on, some penetration and enterprise is happening. But here in enterprise tradition enterprise our fixed switch and routers continue to run very, very well through our OEM partners. Operator  And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ross Seymore I just had a couple of questions on your Wired segment. One of the larger customers in their guided recently and although weaker than expected for their June quarter and talk about some weakness on the service provider side, so other than by product type, can you talk about customer types? Are you seeing any change in the customer behavior that undercover is within that mid-single-digit growth that you’re talking about? Hock Tan No, we don’t. We see in this third quarter, very good data center spending. And I said this, a lot of this -- I assume when you say service provider, you mean the cloud guys. And the cloud guys are very much focused on using merchant silicon on the switching and routing connectivity solutions. So -- and we see very strong spent, which is part of the reason why we are raising our sequential growth in Q3 from Q2 in Wired to be mid -- to up to mid-single digits. Off course, it also helped by the seasonal uptrend we’re seeing in broadband access and set-top box, which is CPE. And that's because of the seasonality, but in some entirely that is also a switching and developing in datacenters.  Ross Seymore And as a follow-up still within that same segment on the broadband segment that you just talked about. Talk a little bit about DOCSIS 3.1 can mean for you. With that rolling out, is there a chance the things can be a little better than seasonal in your broadband business as we go ahead to the second half of the calendar year or are there offset that needed to appreciate? Hock Tan I never try to be too optimistic. At this time of the year -- at this time of the year, we see always the typical seasonality and by we seeing it now and bookings out Q3 and the beginning of Q4, very strong booking, but I'd like to consider that seasonality rather than unusual seasonality this is normal. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani Couple of questions from me as well, I guess to start off with, as you look at your operating margin target around 45%. You guys are 44.1 right now and I think Brocade loan ones closes get you north of that. So, how should we think about margins as you go forward? Is there a desire to keep ticking margins higher? Or do you think this price lasting for this market where you perhaps keep margins the way they are drive revenue grow faster? Hock Tan Well, you asked very complicated strategic question. Amit Daryanani We try to be specific. Hock Tan I know you do, very impressive question, but you won't get as impressive answer through I have to say that because all we are doing is, we sell based on the where you added we provide our very key customers specially what it is. And we believe, we deserve and get the value added we provide in our products to the solutions of our customers. And we think, it will drive us to 45% as a fairly, fairly decent way to get there. Tom Krause Amit, I get this point. We're not updating our financial model. We're not updating our operating margin targets. We're very comfortable at 45%. Amit Daryanani Fair enough. I guess, if I just follow up -- as I think of your gross margin guide for the upcoming quarter. You have a nice 6% uptick in sales but you’re talking the gross margin being flat even though I think the headwind from Wireless not being up as much, should be a benefit. And lastly I think the gross margin up like 40 to 50 basis points in July. Why can’t we see the same level of leverage given mix might be better this July versus last July? Hock Tan Well, we kind of give you what we see. We hit to meet focus guys as you probably know. So, we kind a give you something that we feeling very comfortable with and we are very comfortable at the midpoint of 63% which you're right, we achieved it last quarter.  Tom Krause And Amit, I think we're going to be able to sustain in around that number. I think you're right, there is some wireless mix with slightly headwind. We've also work through a lot of the Broadcom synergies and the benefits we receive there, but I think we planned to sustain that going forward. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Toshiya Hari I had a question on the long-term revenue growth target. Obviously, you guys are committed to the mid-single-digit target that you put out a couple of quarters ago, but as you pointed out, you grew 18% in the quarter. If we take the mid-point of your July quarter guides, I think you guys have, with the quarter growing about 17%. I realize the growth rate and enterprise for example it’s not necessarily sustainable, but what prevents to you from raising the target to say high-single-digits on a long-term basis? Hock Tan On a long-term basis, no, because don’t forget -- the characters of our product guidance all 18 events even the 19 eventually locate. They are very sustainable, that’s a single most important product like sustainable franchisees. I mean the deliver value added and you give delivering new generation of the generation. They’re not there to grow like we, they’re not. But it grows like GDP pretty much economic growth. We’ve added for the fact that each generation provide further value added, which entitled us to have slight premium, but not much. And hence it’s mid-single-digit, which is GDP but like premium. No more in debt and that is long-term sustainable basis because it’s a nature of the products we invest in, nature of our business model. What is seen now? I think is a short-term event, which is driven 18%, 17%, 18% as you mentioned year-on-year in Q2 from last year. It is driven by two part is my view on this matter. One is while the Q2 of a year ago, it’s on because the Q2 this year is strong as much as a Q2 and there is only wireless was unusually weak for good reasons menu, which are not going to, but you all know that. And this quarter is more of a normal Q2, perhaps somewhat buttress by a strong launch of our Korean customer. But it’s kind of stronger than we expect that as I mentioned. So, there is a – a big part of that double digit growth is wireless growth driving in and that’s a 30% of our total revenues approximately. So, it grows a lot, it has that impact. And the second part of it is on infrastructure, our business in Wired, Industrial and Enterprise Storage. This year 17, business is just strong. The pipe just rose and I think that the other part that drove this double-digit growth. But you don’t see that every year. And I think this is fairly unusually strong for infrastructure, but from wireless infrastructure -- so that combination is what created 18% growth. I would not for a second like you guys to cling believe that this is something we will sustain for the next five years. What we feel comfortable, we can sustain for the next five years is what we have said before, and we’ll continue to deliver, hopefully over the next 5 to 10 years, which is mid-single-digit growth on average year-after-year. Toshiya Hari Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then my follow-up, I just want to ask some follow-up question on M&A. And I realize the topic can be a little bit sensitive here. But Hock, you’ve told us to not believe anything we read in the papers. Is it okay for us to walk away thinking that you're not making the bids for that specific asset? Or and again I think ask the gentlemen.  Hock Tan Let me reiterate, please do not believe anything you read and we do not comment on any rumors and pure speculations in the headline, but we continue to focus on our franchise stable business model. We have a lot of free cash flow. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.  Harlan Sur  Congratulations on the solid results and outlook and just great execution by the team. On the topic of free cash flow, you guys generated 32% free cash flow margins. If I normalize to your target of 3% CapEx, you guys actually did 35% free cash flow margins which is your target model. But I'm wondering despite the great cash generation, do you guys still have some restructuring acquisition related cash charges which would imply that the normalized free cash flow even now is better than what you printed and maybe to see if that's to quantify some of those cash restructuring charges? Tom Krause No, you're right you're doing your math absolutely right. The Company take into account the elevated CapEx for mostly the campus investments we're making that you're aware of and some incremental restructuring charges and frankly some working capital headwinds as the business continues to grow. You're quickly get to 35% in which is where we want to be and obviously when we it continue to put up those numbers going forward, but based on where we see revenues and gross margins and operating expenses that we outlined for you, we think that's achievable. Harlan Sur Great. And then so my follow-up question within Enterprise Storage, you guys have got a leadership position and server rate and SaaS controller solutions, and typically these products tend to track server shipments. So given Intel's Skylake server CPU launch and you've got AMD’s Apex server CPU launch, both I think which are ramping now. Is this contributing to the growth during the July quarter and maybe through the second half of this calendar year? Hock Tan Not in the quarter we just entered Q2, and no necessarily march in the July quarter Q3, but certainly we expect probably which is the generation and you're talking about for Intel launching Skylake. The early generation and storage will start to ramp up. You're right back half of this calendar year, really back half of this calendar year.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.  John Pitzer Hock, I want to talk a little bit about the Wired results just for the April quarter. There is a lot of different businesses inside of Wired, but the 3% year-over-year growth rate I think is kind of the slowest growth rate that we've seen since the financial crisis. And so, I'm just kind a curious if you could give us a little bit of color as to what actually happened to the April quarter where there were strength and where there might have been some relative weakness? And then as you think about sort of the reacceleration into July maybe some color around segments within wired would be helpful as well? Hock Tan Wow, that's interesting and very confusing question. But let me try somewhat, and for the rest, I have to take it offline another time because there are a lot of moving parts. And you're correct, in our Wired segments we represent 60% of revenue we throw in the kitchen sink, no really, all related to Wired. That is actually a couple of chunks on broadband, which is broadband access, carrier access, as well as CPE set-top box. And in Q2, totally not that strong obviously, it starts ramping up seasonally Q3, Q4. So, there is that effect there is not that strong and year-on-year a year ago, a year ago result that was a Summer Olympics, so we’re comparing against the Summer Olympics, which will make is touch. And in Q3, Q4, that’s all Summer Olympics of last year should begin to look very good, which is what accelerate this in the second half. In switching and routing, no, we continue to feel very, very good whether it’s in ASIC or merchant silicon, off-take delivery shipment continue to hit all-time high in those two segments. I hope that gives you enough -- and then third thing that messes with up is, we’re building block products by fines, retirements, which are more unique to the designs that’s been used as well as fiber optic which has gone through very interesting direction and cycles, that means mess of the number. But the two broadest area, broadband compared with a year ago is on compared, because the Summer Olympics. But switching and routing, the SMA continues to be a very, very strong franchise whether it’s in form of an ASIC or in the form of merchant silicon. Even though there are both selling into very end market and users. John Pitzer That’s helpful. And Hock, maybe from my follow-up on the ASIC side, I sort of a different question. You’ve always had a strong switching routing into business. It’s my understanding there are also be a basic of things my guess is the controllers and perhaps the things like in trends deep learning. Just kind of curious, how do you think about the ASIC IP, the Broadcom has? Would you consider that franchise and is it leverageable into areas beyond just switching and routing? Hock Tan Yes. You hit it right on. We do did launch ASICs that need to customize, deep learning chips for specific customers. We do that because we have all the IP in the hardware. I mean that’s keep in mind, I believe deep learning is very much as much a software play such more than the hardware play, but we are happy to enable therefore specific large customers in ASICs with customize hardware, which we use even right now and be training or in terms but we do that. Then on SSD controllers, yes, we do a huge amount of SSD controller relatively speaking across our follow, basically for enterprises only, not really enterprises, but all part and enterprise storage business. They are not part in our wide basis. That difference is being very well as you probably can get it to date. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Stacy Rasgon First, I wanted to ask about the cash flow. So again, we can see the margins are pumping up, if you normalize close for 35%. What about the payout ratio? So the payout ratio still running around 5%, we’re not close to 50. What stopping you from bringing it closer to 50 earlier? What’s your trajectory or which you’ll be thinking about the payout ratio? Tom Krause Yes. Stacy, I think, we reiterated a couple of quarters that going put in place the financial policy that we're going to evaluate that once a year at the end of our fiscal year so that will be in October November timeframe. We're going to look back over our last fiscal year look at that cash flow generation, look at the sustainability of the businesses that we're focused on and then make an assessment obviously with the board's approval around a recommendation. But what I want to reiterate is you're right as we continue to perform if we maintain that we could plan to do our 50% payout then that's going to lead to obviously an increased potentially increase in the dividend in the end of the year.  Stacy Rasgon So my follow-up, I want to pick the dead horse but, refresh us on your definition of a franchise. What are the characteristics of a business that meets that definition? And frankly, would it possible for a NAND Flash business to qualify as a franchise under your definition? Hock Tan Good try, okay, let me give you our definition of franchise which is very open and try to ask, give me try to repeat the mantra. No, a franchise basically is a - we grew only components, semiconductor components. And it's just components broadly simply that it operates -- the product lines operate in the niche. Doesn't have to be mess market, most time it's a niche. And so niche where is the way that markets have been established and will likely continue to be established for the foreseeable future. So, we must have established end markets that are sustainable, one. And in that niche, in that market we are the market leader. And more than a market leader especially because we are -- the reason for us to be the market leader, we are the technology leader. We have to have the IT. We have to have the technology and the capability to continue to lead in that particular market. And the third, there is something financials about it. The financial is a fallout, a corollary fallout from those key criteria. And each of our 18 product lines meet those criteria, you made your own call whether NAND meets that criteria. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Shrivastava with BMO. Your line is now open. Ambrish Shrivastava  I wanted to go back to your Wired franchise, Hock. You have talked about and this is a follow-up to John Pitzer's question. With regard to newer areas and all within the umbrella of the 5% that you've articulated for the, quite well over the last couple of years. Is this something that this is a one off that you've done or do you see this as a broader volume with multiple customers as you go through the year and next year? Hock Tan Would you repeat that Pal. I might have missed some part of your question. Would you repeat that? Ambrish Shrivastava  Okay, the deep learning ASIC that you’re rolling out. Is it a one-off for one customer or do you see this expanding to multiple customers? Hock Tan It’s an -- that is learning product, we're doing for multiple customers today are all customized solutions, hardware solutions on outside. They’re not software-based solutions. We are -- it falls into our ASIC category. And we have all-time intellectual property all luckily hardware-based like SerDes, much more than SerDes memories, you name it all kind of stuff that goes into training and inferences on a deep learning chip. We have all that IP, but only doing hardware. We make no pretensions we’re trying to make it our full solution. So within ASIC solution and covers multiple customers and it probably covers multiple generations going forward. But it’s really simply an ASIC solution. Operator  And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities. Your line is now open. Srini Pajjuri  Thank you. Hock, I just want to ask clarifying question to the previous answer. Some of your peers are putting this market opportunity and close to $30 billion. I just want to hear your thoughts of how big the ASIC opportunity for deep learning in European it is like to take maybe a three-year view on this? Hock Tan I have no clue to be honest. Seriously, no -- it is -- our franchise here is the intellectual property, capability, we have of implementing silicon solutions that does deep learning. We produce as well have the IP implemented to do high performance computing or as we do now a lot of switching and routing. This we do in deep learning. And for us, deep learning is not seen necessarily as a franchise. It’s our ASIC capability that is a franchise. Srini Pajjuri  Got it. And then I know you said, you don’t want to comment on your competitors trash talk, but if you could maybe comment on in terms of your BAW performance, I think historically the reason, you have just significant share was you had a significant performance advantage over your competitors. I’m just trying to understand, if some of your peers are close in the gap or at least narrowing the gap and as we look out the next couple of years. Just want to understand, how much advantage you still have in BAW? Hock Tan Remember, my definition of a sustainable franchise. We don’t talk investments, I mean contrary to myths out there. We are join every time, we quick public product line as our core product line as among the ’18. We invest as much as we have to maintain, it’s not lengthen our need. No different yet, we don’t say put at the generation of last year, or two years ago, or three years ago, we continue invest the lead that we direct review never closes. And that’s the key fund of our model. We will invest and given that your market leader in that niche, we can’t afford to out invest anyone out there. We’ve been in R&D for even better and as you know in totality, some of it packed up in cost of sales or product engineering as we bring it to production. The rest of it in R&D, we spend on product development in this company every year $3 billion and that something from CapEx, $3 billion. And we are very, very conscious of the fact that we have to maintain is not even increase that level of spending where we need to in specific areas to ensure that we are the leader both in technology which leads to market leader. So not that easy to narrow but leads is to in terms of coming to compete with us.  Operator Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Steven Chen with UBS. Your line is now open. Steven Chen Hock, if I could I wanted to follow up your earlier comments on storage, your storage business and the guidance for stable demand again in this fiscal third quarter. I was wondering if you're looking back earlier this year when the storage business was seeing better than NAND because some of the storages in NAND Flash and [indiscernible]. I was wondering, if your customers are providing you a much commentary around whether the current hard drive demand, is in line with broader demand or for total come in that NAND as the shortages that are helping hard drive demand? Hock Tan It's a very hard market to predict at this point, because there are a lot of multiple dynamics going on in terms of it's not just about Flash demand being an outreaching very high levels, which is driving everything else probably is but into that was probably late '16 early '17. Today I guess all this big all this increased prices in memory whether its DRAM flash is not hard drives as part of the DRAM and flash is leading to careful spending by enterprises and operators and cloud guys and datacenter. They're all been very careful. So suddenly you have demand that is there, that is needed but people are not spending. And you will have this stop and spot going on. So it's all very confusing it's all I'm trying to come to get on. And I'm not sure we have as much and embedded on we have any better visibility even our customers. Our customers have better visibility on their nerves for that manner. It's just very confusing and all we can see is that demand has strengthened out for our products be the SSDs or be the SSD flash control as I should clarify or be the components -- and -- for hard disk drive. All we see is that a quarter ago we are seeing but we got to be careful about Q3. Well, Q2 is -- and gone Q2 was good, Q3 continues to look good, but then on doing -- say Q4 in many case we don't, with strong booking Q4 but it may not be a strong and a big part of their uncertainty and lies in fact that they're more than just simply a shortage of flash or DRAM that's creating this uncertainty. I think it's much more than that, it's also the change in spending pattern even in a short term of datacenter guys, cloud guys and enterprises because of higher memory prices.  Steven Chen Okay. I appreciate that consideration and I just had a quick follow up for your wireless connectivity business. And then much of Fab revenue is still driven by mobile type applications. So I was wondering how meaningful is your exposure to enterprise type at this point today and any exposure and like where the hot spots potentially going forward? Thanks. Hock Tan There are. There are as far as I can potentially describe is broadband carrier exchange are increasingly even set-top-box which includes set-top-box both CPE that is as well as central office are starting to spread Wi-Fi as another means. You have GPON, EPON, you have DSL, VDSL. Now, WiFi into the picture. So it’s all good and we are very, very well position in all this and going to generation. So, it is giving us more content to be put it this way at every access point which may help the growth. But it’s still not a big by the way as the phone by comparison the volume. But it’s a decent amount of volume and gives us a very sustainable franchise in this area. Tom Krause Yes. And even this is just housekeeping but that business, while product line is in our Wireline segment, not in our wireless segment. Hock Tan Thank you for clarifying. Yes, it sits in Wired, not in Wireless. Operator  Thank you. And that concludes Broadcom’s conference call for today. You may now disconnect.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open. Blayne Curtis Just want to follow up on the Wireless side you said it’s slow ramp . I was just kind of curious, is this the timing or magnitude? I think you have meant that it’s going to be more in Q4, but if maybe you could just wrap some color around that? Hock Tan It’s timing. I think, it is timing; last year, the similar ramp was earlier -- was stronger in Q3 probably because it was earlier. And here the initial volume in our fiscal Q2 was smaller, made up with content on our side, but definitely Q4 is forecasted to be larger. Blayne Curtis And then, you mentioned this from the Storage side, you had some conservatism on the second half and you're seeing growth. Maybe if you can just talk about, what you're seeing on the Storage side that is growing? And then, what are you seeing. I think the hard drives where you're most concerned, what’s making you feel better about that market? Hock Tan Well, it's growing -- it’s growing as we mentioned pretty much single digit, low-single digit. I would say it's at a high elevated level and kind of staying there for now in Q3. Q4 of course as we expressed in a cautionary manner is a whole new game. Visibility is -- obviously, we are not booking everything in Q4 here, but we pretty booked Q3. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Vivek Arya  Thanks for taking my question and great job on consistent execution. So my first question Hock, can you please address these recent media reports about the potentially large bit for Toshiba's assets? I realized the details are not public, but there is a very large amount of money involved. And I think investors are keen to know how you're thinking about it conceptually and whether you are still committed to being disciplined around maintaining your free cash flow returns and not taking big technology risks when you consider M&A. Hock Tan We are very committed to our business model of only having franchises, very much though. And as I mentioned, all 18 of our product lines are product franchises in connectivity solutions. We are also very committed to not only those franchises but generating lots and lots of free cash flow which we top of -- which we will return to shareholder. All that up on model, no change. Bottom line, don't believe everything you read out there, please. Vivek Arya  I see. And then secondly on the Wireless business, I think you gave some good color for Q3. Just one question on Q4 and then maybe longer term, Q4 when I look in the last 5 years, the median sort of sequential growth has been close to 30%. So, is that the kind of level that you're thinking about this year or maybe even better given the delayed shipments of those phones and a higher content you've suggested? And then longer term on that same Wireless theme, I think one of your competitors, Qorvo recently outlined some plans to perhaps take some share at your large customer with the High Band PAD. And I wanted to see, how secure you think your competitive position is on next year's phone models? Thank you. Hock Tan There is a lot of questions and content. I’ll start with the serious one. We don't forecast beyond one quarter you know, bad practice frankly because we could be very sadly wrong. But obviously, what we are also seeing is from the limited visibility we see, we see the ramp beginning in our fiscal Q3 which as you know is an off calendar ramp by one month, July. So, we captured a part of that ramp, we believe it is a small part, and we expect to capture the substantial part of that ramp in Q4. But keep in mind always when you compare year-on-year, we have different content levels from a year ago substantial as I pointed out. So, that my kind of confused the numbers somewhat. But suffice to say, Q3 as we outlined since the beginning of the ramp may not be the same level of ramp if you compare to a year ago for the couple of reasons I mentioned. But we also see Q4 to even ramp up, even more substantially obviously because if Q3 is slower, it’s more than likely Q4 in any product ramp would just show a stronger quarter compared to Q3. So, that said, but other -- the specifics really, I am not really at liberty to disclose it because we just don’t go look that far out. As far as the trash talk you hear out there, seriously, we don’t prefer to -- I prefer not to comment on that. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig Hettenbach Thanks. I have just follow-up on Wireless on the content side. Can you give maybe a little bit of context, if you split kind of the legacy of Viago and RF relative to the Broadcom kind of connectivity and maybe touch piece? Hock Tan I am already stretching a lot to say, there is a certain North American customer. We have very good content to customer we daily value. I prefer not to give you any more details other than that. Thank you. Craig Hettenbach Okay. I’ll try another one on the networking side. Can you talk about just the trajectory in the merchant silicon business and any new kind of customer adoptions or ramps to think about there? Hock Tan Well, we feel very good about our merchant silicon in switching and now routing as we call it, which is the DNX series and the Jericho, Jericho plus all the -- and we have launched that. And their use not just -- its routers, they use as aggregation switching in the spine. And so, it’s a very good aggregation, solidly much cover in our merchant silicon even at the high performance, high competitive top of the rack switching. We pretty much cover a full range of requirements. And so that’s going to alone very well. In fact, as of penetration especially in the cloud guys is very, very good. Adoption among the hyper-scale cloud guys is extremely strong, extremely well used. And well, all this is going on, some penetration and enterprise is happening. But here in enterprise tradition enterprise our fixed switch and routers continue to run very, very well through our OEM partners. Operator  And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ross Seymore I just had a couple of questions on your Wired segment. One of the larger customers in their guided recently and although weaker than expected for their June quarter and talk about some weakness on the service provider side, so other than by product type, can you talk about customer types? Are you seeing any change in the customer behavior that undercover is within that mid-single-digit growth that you’re talking about? Hock Tan No, we don’t. We see in this third quarter, very good data center spending. And I said this, a lot of this -- I assume when you say service provider, you mean the cloud guys. And the cloud guys are very much focused on using merchant silicon on the switching and routing connectivity solutions. So -- and we see very strong spent, which is part of the reason why we are raising our sequential growth in Q3 from Q2 in Wired to be mid -- to up to mid-single digits. Off course, it also helped by the seasonal uptrend we’re seeing in broadband access and set-top box, which is CPE. And that's because of the seasonality, but in some entirely that is also a switching and developing in datacenters.  Ross Seymore And as a follow-up still within that same segment on the broadband segment that you just talked about. Talk a little bit about DOCSIS 3.1 can mean for you. With that rolling out, is there a chance the things can be a little better than seasonal in your broadband business as we go ahead to the second half of the calendar year or are there offset that needed to appreciate? Hock Tan I never try to be too optimistic. At this time of the year -- at this time of the year, we see always the typical seasonality and by we seeing it now and bookings out Q3 and the beginning of Q4, very strong booking, but I'd like to consider that seasonality rather than unusual seasonality this is normal. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani Couple of questions from me as well, I guess to start off with, as you look at your operating margin target around 45%. You guys are 44.1 right now and I think Brocade loan ones closes get you north of that. So, how should we think about margins as you go forward? Is there a desire to keep ticking margins higher? Or do you think this price lasting for this market where you perhaps keep margins the way they are drive revenue grow faster? Hock Tan Well, you asked very complicated strategic question. Amit Daryanani We try to be specific. Hock Tan I know you do, very impressive question, but you won't get as impressive answer through I have to say that because all we are doing is, we sell based on the where you added we provide our very key customers specially what it is. And we believe, we deserve and get the value added we provide in our products to the solutions of our customers. And we think, it will drive us to 45% as a fairly, fairly decent way to get there. Tom Krause Amit, I get this point. We're not updating our financial model. We're not updating our operating margin targets. We're very comfortable at 45%. Amit Daryanani Fair enough. I guess, if I just follow up -- as I think of your gross margin guide for the upcoming quarter. You have a nice 6% uptick in sales but you’re talking the gross margin being flat even though I think the headwind from Wireless not being up as much, should be a benefit. And lastly I think the gross margin up like 40 to 50 basis points in July. Why can’t we see the same level of leverage given mix might be better this July versus last July? Hock Tan Well, we kind of give you what we see. We hit to meet focus guys as you probably know. So, we kind a give you something that we feeling very comfortable with and we are very comfortable at the midpoint of 63% which you're right, we achieved it last quarter.  Tom Krause And Amit, I think we're going to be able to sustain in around that number. I think you're right, there is some wireless mix with slightly headwind. We've also work through a lot of the Broadcom synergies and the benefits we receive there, but I think we planned to sustain that going forward. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Toshiya Hari I had a question on the long-term revenue growth target. Obviously, you guys are committed to the mid-single-digit target that you put out a couple of quarters ago, but as you pointed out, you grew 18% in the quarter. If we take the mid-point of your July quarter guides, I think you guys have, with the quarter growing about 17%. I realize the growth rate and enterprise for example it’s not necessarily sustainable, but what prevents to you from raising the target to say high-single-digits on a long-term basis? Hock Tan On a long-term basis, no, because don’t forget -- the characters of our product guidance all 18 events even the 19 eventually locate. They are very sustainable, that’s a single most important product like sustainable franchisees. I mean the deliver value added and you give delivering new generation of the generation. They’re not there to grow like we, they’re not. But it grows like GDP pretty much economic growth. We’ve added for the fact that each generation provide further value added, which entitled us to have slight premium, but not much. And hence it’s mid-single-digit, which is GDP but like premium. No more in debt and that is long-term sustainable basis because it’s a nature of the products we invest in, nature of our business model. What is seen now? I think is a short-term event, which is driven 18%, 17%, 18% as you mentioned year-on-year in Q2 from last year. It is driven by two part is my view on this matter. One is while the Q2 of a year ago, it’s on because the Q2 this year is strong as much as a Q2 and there is only wireless was unusually weak for good reasons menu, which are not going to, but you all know that. And this quarter is more of a normal Q2, perhaps somewhat buttress by a strong launch of our Korean customer. But it’s kind of stronger than we expect that as I mentioned. So, there is a – a big part of that double digit growth is wireless growth driving in and that’s a 30% of our total revenues approximately. So, it grows a lot, it has that impact. And the second part of it is on infrastructure, our business in Wired, Industrial and Enterprise Storage. This year 17, business is just strong. The pipe just rose and I think that the other part that drove this double-digit growth. But you don’t see that every year. And I think this is fairly unusually strong for infrastructure, but from wireless infrastructure -- so that combination is what created 18% growth. I would not for a second like you guys to cling believe that this is something we will sustain for the next five years. What we feel comfortable, we can sustain for the next five years is what we have said before, and we’ll continue to deliver, hopefully over the next 5 to 10 years, which is mid-single-digit growth on average year-after-year. Toshiya Hari Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then my follow-up, I just want to ask some follow-up question on M&A. And I realize the topic can be a little bit sensitive here. But Hock, you’ve told us to not believe anything we read in the papers. Is it okay for us to walk away thinking that you're not making the bids for that specific asset? Or and again I think ask the gentlemen.  Hock Tan Let me reiterate, please do not believe anything you read and we do not comment on any rumors and pure speculations in the headline, but we continue to focus on our franchise stable business model. We have a lot of free cash flow. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.  Harlan Sur  Congratulations on the solid results and outlook and just great execution by the team. On the topic of free cash flow, you guys generated 32% free cash flow margins. If I normalize to your target of 3% CapEx, you guys actually did 35% free cash flow margins which is your target model. But I'm wondering despite the great cash generation, do you guys still have some restructuring acquisition related cash charges which would imply that the normalized free cash flow even now is better than what you printed and maybe to see if that's to quantify some of those cash restructuring charges? Tom Krause No, you're right you're doing your math absolutely right. The Company take into account the elevated CapEx for mostly the campus investments we're making that you're aware of and some incremental restructuring charges and frankly some working capital headwinds as the business continues to grow. You're quickly get to 35% in which is where we want to be and obviously when we it continue to put up those numbers going forward, but based on where we see revenues and gross margins and operating expenses that we outlined for you, we think that's achievable. Harlan Sur Great. And then so my follow-up question within Enterprise Storage, you guys have got a leadership position and server rate and SaaS controller solutions, and typically these products tend to track server shipments. So given Intel's Skylake server CPU launch and you've got AMD’s Apex server CPU launch, both I think which are ramping now. Is this contributing to the growth during the July quarter and maybe through the second half of this calendar year? Hock Tan Not in the quarter we just entered Q2, and no necessarily march in the July quarter Q3, but certainly we expect probably which is the generation and you're talking about for Intel launching Skylake. The early generation and storage will start to ramp up. You're right back half of this calendar year, really back half of this calendar year.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.  John Pitzer Hock, I want to talk a little bit about the Wired results just for the April quarter. There is a lot of different businesses inside of Wired, but the 3% year-over-year growth rate I think is kind of the slowest growth rate that we've seen since the financial crisis. And so, I'm just kind a curious if you could give us a little bit of color as to what actually happened to the April quarter where there were strength and where there might have been some relative weakness? And then as you think about sort of the reacceleration into July maybe some color around segments within wired would be helpful as well? Hock Tan Wow, that's interesting and very confusing question. But let me try somewhat, and for the rest, I have to take it offline another time because there are a lot of moving parts. And you're correct, in our Wired segments we represent 60% of revenue we throw in the kitchen sink, no really, all related to Wired. That is actually a couple of chunks on broadband, which is broadband access, carrier access, as well as CPE set-top box. And in Q2, totally not that strong obviously, it starts ramping up seasonally Q3, Q4. So, there is that effect there is not that strong and year-on-year a year ago, a year ago result that was a Summer Olympics, so we’re comparing against the Summer Olympics, which will make is touch. And in Q3, Q4, that’s all Summer Olympics of last year should begin to look very good, which is what accelerate this in the second half. In switching and routing, no, we continue to feel very, very good whether it’s in ASIC or merchant silicon, off-take delivery shipment continue to hit all-time high in those two segments. I hope that gives you enough -- and then third thing that messes with up is, we’re building block products by fines, retirements, which are more unique to the designs that’s been used as well as fiber optic which has gone through very interesting direction and cycles, that means mess of the number. But the two broadest area, broadband compared with a year ago is on compared, because the Summer Olympics. But switching and routing, the SMA continues to be a very, very strong franchise whether it’s in form of an ASIC or in the form of merchant silicon. Even though there are both selling into very end market and users. John Pitzer That’s helpful. And Hock, maybe from my follow-up on the ASIC side, I sort of a different question. You’ve always had a strong switching routing into business. It’s my understanding there are also be a basic of things my guess is the controllers and perhaps the things like in trends deep learning. Just kind of curious, how do you think about the ASIC IP, the Broadcom has? Would you consider that franchise and is it leverageable into areas beyond just switching and routing? Hock Tan Yes. You hit it right on. We do did launch ASICs that need to customize, deep learning chips for specific customers. We do that because we have all the IP in the hardware. I mean that’s keep in mind, I believe deep learning is very much as much a software play such more than the hardware play, but we are happy to enable therefore specific large customers in ASICs with customize hardware, which we use even right now and be training or in terms but we do that. Then on SSD controllers, yes, we do a huge amount of SSD controller relatively speaking across our follow, basically for enterprises only, not really enterprises, but all part and enterprise storage business. They are not part in our wide basis. That difference is being very well as you probably can get it to date. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Stacy Rasgon First, I wanted to ask about the cash flow. So again, we can see the margins are pumping up, if you normalize close for 35%. What about the payout ratio? So the payout ratio still running around 5%, we’re not close to 50. What stopping you from bringing it closer to 50 earlier? What’s your trajectory or which you’ll be thinking about the payout ratio? Tom Krause Yes. Stacy, I think, we reiterated a couple of quarters that going put in place the financial policy that we're going to evaluate that once a year at the end of our fiscal year so that will be in October November timeframe. We're going to look back over our last fiscal year look at that cash flow generation, look at the sustainability of the businesses that we're focused on and then make an assessment obviously with the board's approval around a recommendation. But what I want to reiterate is you're right as we continue to perform if we maintain that we could plan to do our 50% payout then that's going to lead to obviously an increased potentially increase in the dividend in the end of the year.  Stacy Rasgon So my follow-up, I want to pick the dead horse but, refresh us on your definition of a franchise. What are the characteristics of a business that meets that definition? And frankly, would it possible for a NAND Flash business to qualify as a franchise under your definition? Hock Tan Good try, okay, let me give you our definition of franchise which is very open and try to ask, give me try to repeat the mantra. No, a franchise basically is a - we grew only components, semiconductor components. And it's just components broadly simply that it operates -- the product lines operate in the niche. Doesn't have to be mess market, most time it's a niche. And so niche where is the way that markets have been established and will likely continue to be established for the foreseeable future. So, we must have established end markets that are sustainable, one. And in that niche, in that market we are the market leader. And more than a market leader especially because we are -- the reason for us to be the market leader, we are the technology leader. We have to have the IT. We have to have the technology and the capability to continue to lead in that particular market. And the third, there is something financials about it. The financial is a fallout, a corollary fallout from those key criteria. And each of our 18 product lines meet those criteria, you made your own call whether NAND meets that criteria. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Shrivastava with BMO. Your line is now open. Ambrish Shrivastava  I wanted to go back to your Wired franchise, Hock. You have talked about and this is a follow-up to John Pitzer's question. With regard to newer areas and all within the umbrella of the 5% that you've articulated for the, quite well over the last couple of years. Is this something that this is a one off that you've done or do you see this as a broader volume with multiple customers as you go through the year and next year? Hock Tan Would you repeat that Pal. I might have missed some part of your question. Would you repeat that? Ambrish Shrivastava  Okay, the deep learning ASIC that you’re rolling out. Is it a one-off for one customer or do you see this expanding to multiple customers? Hock Tan It’s an -- that is learning product, we're doing for multiple customers today are all customized solutions, hardware solutions on outside. They’re not software-based solutions. We are -- it falls into our ASIC category. And we have all-time intellectual property all luckily hardware-based like SerDes, much more than SerDes memories, you name it all kind of stuff that goes into training and inferences on a deep learning chip. We have all that IP, but only doing hardware. We make no pretensions we’re trying to make it our full solution. So within ASIC solution and covers multiple customers and it probably covers multiple generations going forward. But it’s really simply an ASIC solution. Operator  And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities. Your line is now open. Srini Pajjuri  Thank you. Hock, I just want to ask clarifying question to the previous answer. Some of your peers are putting this market opportunity and close to $30 billion. I just want to hear your thoughts of how big the ASIC opportunity for deep learning in European it is like to take maybe a three-year view on this? Hock Tan I have no clue to be honest. Seriously, no -- it is -- our franchise here is the intellectual property, capability, we have of implementing silicon solutions that does deep learning. We produce as well have the IP implemented to do high performance computing or as we do now a lot of switching and routing. This we do in deep learning. And for us, deep learning is not seen necessarily as a franchise. It’s our ASIC capability that is a franchise. Srini Pajjuri  Got it. And then I know you said, you don’t want to comment on your competitors trash talk, but if you could maybe comment on in terms of your BAW performance, I think historically the reason, you have just significant share was you had a significant performance advantage over your competitors. I’m just trying to understand, if some of your peers are close in the gap or at least narrowing the gap and as we look out the next couple of years. Just want to understand, how much advantage you still have in BAW? Hock Tan Remember, my definition of a sustainable franchise. We don’t talk investments, I mean contrary to myths out there. We are join every time, we quick public product line as our core product line as among the ’18. We invest as much as we have to maintain, it’s not lengthen our need. No different yet, we don’t say put at the generation of last year, or two years ago, or three years ago, we continue invest the lead that we direct review never closes. And that’s the key fund of our model. We will invest and given that your market leader in that niche, we can’t afford to out invest anyone out there. We’ve been in R&D for even better and as you know in totality, some of it packed up in cost of sales or product engineering as we bring it to production. The rest of it in R&D, we spend on product development in this company every year $3 billion and that something from CapEx, $3 billion. And we are very, very conscious of the fact that we have to maintain is not even increase that level of spending where we need to in specific areas to ensure that we are the leader both in technology which leads to market leader. So not that easy to narrow but leads is to in terms of coming to compete with us.  Operator Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Steven Chen with UBS. Your line is now open. Steven Chen Hock, if I could I wanted to follow up your earlier comments on storage, your storage business and the guidance for stable demand again in this fiscal third quarter. I was wondering if you're looking back earlier this year when the storage business was seeing better than NAND because some of the storages in NAND Flash and [indiscernible]. I was wondering, if your customers are providing you a much commentary around whether the current hard drive demand, is in line with broader demand or for total come in that NAND as the shortages that are helping hard drive demand? Hock Tan It's a very hard market to predict at this point, because there are a lot of multiple dynamics going on in terms of it's not just about Flash demand being an outreaching very high levels, which is driving everything else probably is but into that was probably late '16 early '17. Today I guess all this big all this increased prices in memory whether its DRAM flash is not hard drives as part of the DRAM and flash is leading to careful spending by enterprises and operators and cloud guys and datacenter. They're all been very careful. So suddenly you have demand that is there, that is needed but people are not spending. And you will have this stop and spot going on. So it's all very confusing it's all I'm trying to come to get on. And I'm not sure we have as much and embedded on we have any better visibility even our customers. Our customers have better visibility on their nerves for that manner. It's just very confusing and all we can see is that demand has strengthened out for our products be the SSDs or be the SSD flash control as I should clarify or be the components -- and -- for hard disk drive. All we see is that a quarter ago we are seeing but we got to be careful about Q3. Well, Q2 is -- and gone Q2 was good, Q3 continues to look good, but then on doing -- say Q4 in many case we don't, with strong booking Q4 but it may not be a strong and a big part of their uncertainty and lies in fact that they're more than just simply a shortage of flash or DRAM that's creating this uncertainty. I think it's much more than that, it's also the change in spending pattern even in a short term of datacenter guys, cloud guys and enterprises because of higher memory prices.  Steven Chen Okay. I appreciate that consideration and I just had a quick follow up for your wireless connectivity business. And then much of Fab revenue is still driven by mobile type applications. So I was wondering how meaningful is your exposure to enterprise type at this point today and any exposure and like where the hot spots potentially going forward? Thanks. Hock Tan There are. There are as far as I can potentially describe is broadband carrier exchange are increasingly even set-top-box which includes set-top-box both CPE that is as well as central office are starting to spread Wi-Fi as another means. You have GPON, EPON, you have DSL, VDSL. Now, WiFi into the picture. So it’s all good and we are very, very well position in all this and going to generation. So, it is giving us more content to be put it this way at every access point which may help the growth. But it’s still not a big by the way as the phone by comparison the volume. But it’s a decent amount of volume and gives us a very sustainable franchise in this area. Tom Krause Yes. And even this is just housekeeping but that business, while product line is in our Wireline segment, not in our wireless segment. Hock Tan Thank you for clarifying. Yes, it sits in Wired, not in Wireless. Operator  Thank you. And that concludes Broadcom’s conference call for today. You may now disconnect.

And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett Super. Thank you, Tricia and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call and we certainly appreciate you and thank you for sharing your time with us today. Simply, the entire SDI team performed phenomenally well this quarter. Each of our business platforms improved earnings, with many divisions achieving record line operating rates. And I believe the results really speak for themselves and the intentional positioning of the company will continue to reap the benefits of improving market dynamics.  But to begin, Theresa, would you comment on our financial results? Theresa Wagler Absolutely. Good morning, everyone. I also want to recognize the team's performance across our platforms, delivering an excellent first quarter performance. Our first quarter 2017 net income was $201 million or $0.82 per diluted share, slightly above our guidance range of between $0.77 and $0.81 per share. This compares to net income of $63 million or $0.26 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year and $20 million or $0.08 per diluted share in the sequential quarter. First quarter 2017 revenues were $2.4 billion, a 24% improvement over the sequential fourth quarter. All operating platforms improved. However, the growth was primarily driven by our steel operations as both average selling values and volumes improved. Our operating income for the first quarter increased over 75% to $335 million compared to sequential quarter adjusted results. Again, a solid performance by everyone as almost each location improved profitability, although the steel platform experienced the most significant growth of $135 million, a 62% increase from last quarter. For the first quarter 2017, steel shipments increased 12% to 2.5 million tons. Volumes increased across all divisions. Flat roll improved 11% as demand was strong and customer inventory levels continue to be at historically low levels. Our long products [indiscernible] increased shipments 16%, largely driven from our Engineered Bar and Structural and Rail division. Metal spread expansion in flat roll and increased volume across the platform resulted in operating income from our steel operations of $352 million, a significant improvement from fourth quarter. First quarter 2017 steel platform average selling prices increased $63 per ton to $743, outpacing the increase in average scrap cost of $44 per ton.  For our metals recycling platform, higher domestic steel mill utilization also resulted in increased ferrous scrap demand and a 14% improvement in our ferrous shipments as well as a 12% improvement in metal spread, resulting in strong operating metric. First quarter operating income for our metals recycling platform more than doubled to $21 million compared to $10 million in the sequential fourth quarter. Additionally, we closed on the sale of several non-core scrapyards located in southeastern U.S. The sale was basically transacted at book value and therefore, no significant gain or loss was recognized.  The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our vertically integrated model, benefiting both the steel mills and the scrap operations. Metals recycling has maintained a higher-than-historical percentage of total internal ferrous shipments to support SDI steel mills at 64% in the first quarter. For fabrication, driven by record shipments, first quarter 2017 operating income increased 34% sequentially to $24 million. It was typically a seasonally lower period. Nonresidential construction demand continues to be steady throughout much of the United States and we continue to see strong quote and order entry activity. During the first quarter 2017, we generated cash flow from operations of $240 million, with operational working capital using just over $150 million in the quarter. The increased working capital was primarily driven by higher customer count values based on increased prices and volume. Inventory values also increased in the quarter somewhat. We grew our cash dividend in the first quarter by 11% to $0.155 per common share based on our ability to consistently generate strong cash. We also repurchased $61 million of our common stock during the first quarter, pursuant to the October 2016 board-authorized $450 million program. We believe these actions reflect the strength of our capital structure and liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. As a result, we maintained liquidity of $2.2 million at March 31 comprised of our undrawn revolver and an available cash of $967 million. First quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA was $421 million and trailing 12-month EBITDA was nearly $1.4 billion. The strength of our through-cycle cash generation coupled with a strong credit and capital structure profile provides great opportunity for continued organic and inorganic growth. We're squarely focused on the continuation of sustainable optimized value creation. Mark? Mark Millett Super. Thank you, Theresa. Well, the welfare of employees remains our #1 priority and nothing surpasses the importance of creating and maintaining a safe work environment. Our safety performance remains significantly better than industry averages and we continue to work toward a 0 incident environment. The team is doing a phenomenal job there. Also, over 80% of our locations achieved 0 record injuries so far this year. We also reduced our total recordable injury rate in the first quarter by 11% when compared to last year's full results which, I'd remind you, was the best ever for our company. My sincere thanks to the entire team for their dedication and continued focus on our first and foremost priority. The steel platform had an outstanding quarter in part because we have one of the most diversified and value-added product profiles in the industry. We operated at utilization rate of 95% during the first quarter, once again, markedly better than the domestic industry rate of about 75%. Demand from the automotive sector remained steady and construction continued to improve. Additionally, the energy-related demand improvement that we discussed on our January conference call actually strengthened further during the quarter. We received related orders both at Columbus Flat Roll Division and Engineered Bar Products Division. Additionally, there was an overall general demand improvement for our SBQ steel which typically suggests broader industrial sector momentum.  Our earnings improvement was primarily driven by the flat roll group. Domestically, flat-rolled steel utilization rates remained much higher in the first quarter compared to long product utilization rates. Flat-rolled steel benefited from sturdy demand coupled with continued favorable supply dynamics. Customer inventory levels remained at historical lows and imports in total were down year-over-year for the quarter. It should be noted, though, that despite hot-rolled coil imports being down considerably, cold-rolled sheet and coated were up materially year-over-year. Additionally, pipe and tube imports grew over 35% in the quarter. Our long product steel shipments improved in the quarter, but selling values remained under pressure from excess domestic production capability coupled with elevated import levels which grew over 15% in the quarter. Although our consolidated quarterly production utilization rate was 95%, our Long Products division's operated at 78%. While not as high as we'd like, it's an improvement from last year's average rate of 68%. The most significant change was seen in SBQ. Our Engineered Bar Products Division operated over 70% of its current capacity compared to just over 50% in 2015 and '16. Not only did we see improved demand environment, but the Engineered Bar Division is also benefiting from the bulk and pull-through volume. Based on 2016 shipments, the SDI steel platform has over 1.5 million tons of unused shipping capability. And most of this latent capacity is in product types that would potentially be consumed by infrastructure and large civil engineering projects.  The flat roll mill in Columbus provides another significant and sustainable earnings catalyst. The changes the team has already made are transformational. The successful market and product diversification that was achieved over the last 2 years is one of the key differentiators for the improved profitability realized in 2016 and will continue to benefit the coming years as well. It remains an exciting time for the Columbus team as they continue to focus on product diversification and increasing their value-add product capabilities. The team completed construction of $100 million paint line in the fourth quarter of 2016. This investment provides 250,000 tons of annual pre-paint capability and further diversification into some of the highest-margin products. We have 2 existing paint lines in Indiana and this new line is truly state-of-the-art facility, allowing for even higher-quality double-wide steel and facilitates access to the southern U.S. and Mexican markets. Our existing customer base is excited to have that geographic and product diversification optionality. The startup is going well with painted shipments of just under 13,000 tons in the first quarter. And I've got to add that I've been down there just recently and I've seen many lines over my lifetime, but it is the most phenomenal facility I've ever seen. And anytime you folks have a chance to get down there, you should go visit. It is phenomenal. The team did a marvelous, marvelous job. Our steel platform continues to benefit from other organic growth investments as well. We're investing $15 million to increase annual galvanizing productivity by 180,000 tons at Butler, further increasing the mill's value-added production capability. We anticipate commissioning the equipment this summer and increase production capability available for the second half of this year. We're also investing $28 million to utilize excess melting and casting capability at our Roanoke Bar Division. We're adding equipment that will allow for multi-strand slitting and rebar finishing. With a highly competitive cost structure, we expect to have strong market penetration as we will be the only noncompeting producer for rebar in the region selling to independent fabricators. Commission is on schedule to start at the end of this year. Regarding our raw material platform, the profitability of our metals recycling platform more than doubled in the first quarter 2017. As increased domestic steel mill utilization strengthened, ferrous scrap shipments and improving market dynamics allowed metal spread appreciation. Shipments improved 14%, while average ferrous selling values rose over 35% in the quarter. We anticipate a continuation on the relatively strong U.S. dollar and associated low scrap exports, supporting ample scrap supply and a more stabilized scrap price environment as the year progresses.  We also closed on sale of some recycling assets located in the southeastern U.S. at the beginning of March. This transaction better aligns our remaining metals recycling locations to directly serve our mills and also provides the opportunity for additional administrative cost savings. The fabrication platform continued its strong performance, achieving record quarterly shipments in what is typically a seasonally lower demand period. In fact, the order backlog at the end of March was at a record high volume. The team is achieving great market penetration in both joist and deck. Fabrication operations purchased 330,000 tons of steel from SDI steel mills in 2016 and are on track to continue to purchase meaningful quantities in 2017. The power of pull-through volume when fabrication sources steel from our own mills is a significant advantage to keeping our steel platform utilization rates higher during weaker demand environments. The New Millennium team continues to perform exceptionally, levering our national footprint and providing quality product. The ongoing strength of this business and continued customer optimism also provides positive insight into the continued strength of the nonresidential construction activity. With steady to growing demand, lower-than-historic supply chain inventory levels and trade constraints in place, the flat roll supply-demand environment is very positive and we expect these dynamics to continue. We have a constructive view on the domestic steel consumption in the coming years. Domestic automotive production may be edging off record levels, but we believe total NAFTA production will grow slightly as Mexico continues to grow production with current assets in place. This is highly complementary to our Columbus Division's automotive strategy. We believe there will be additional growth in the construction sector, especially for larger public sector infrastructure projects which would greatly benefit our Long Products group. We also anticipate continued improvement within the energy sector.  So going forward, we continue to focus on adding value-added products to our portfolio that help insulate us from imports and create long-lasting customer partnerships, such as our painted flat-rolled steel, highly engineered SBQ and longer-length rail. In addition, the pull-through steel volume strategy remains one of our focuses for ongoing inorganic growth. Our business model and execution of our long term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our industry competition. Customer focus, coupled with market diversification and low-cost operating platforms, supports our ability to maintain our best-in-class financial performance and differentiation. The company and the team are poised for continued growth. The strong character and determination of our employees provides the foundation for our success. I thank each of them for their hard work and dedication and remind them safety is always the first priority. We continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, customers, employees and shareholders alike and look forward to creating new opportunities for all and the years ahead.  So again, thank you for your time today and Rob, we're open for questions now. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Seth Rosenfeld with Jefferies. Seth Rosenfeld Seth Rosenfeld from Jefferies. I have one question picking off on -- I have one quick question picking off on your realized sale prices over the last quarter. Your ASP seems like it's stronger than what we were forecasting. Can you just talk a little bit about any shift you're seeing in product mix or contract mix to help us better understand what's driving your current robust realized prices and, I guess tied to that, where we're seeing the outside strength in your sales volumes in flat steel as well? You discussed in the report some of the drivers on the long side, but I'd like to hear a bit more detail on flats there. Theresa Wagler So on average sales price perspective, Seth, you've seen a pretty significant product shift with the addition of the volume from SBQ, from our Engineered Bar Division. So that was impactful to the average sales price for the quarter as well as just the long products in general as well as some appreciation in product mix within the flat roll group. Although the paint line is just having a little bit of impact right now in Columbus, we're seeing very good strength at Columbus on the rest of the value-add side of the equation. So we're seeing an overall product shift toward the value-add side and that volume impact from long products actually helps support the average sales price being maybe higher than what you would have forecast originally. As it relates to demand for flat roll, we've seen a lot of demand, both steady demand in automotives. A lot of that's been impacting core Columbus. Construction is remaining very strong for us, but we're also seeing increased demand from the energy sector, specifically at Columbus. And that's something that we didn't expect to see as much strength in the first quarter as we've seen. Barry, is there anything else to add on an end market perspective for flat rolls? Barry Schneider Just that we continue to work on the energy products that fit our mix very well. And it's good to see the return of buying activity in that sector. Operator Our next question comes from David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano I just have a couple of quick questions. First of all, I think in your prepared remarks, you said you expect a more stabilized scrap price environment, I think, for the remainder of the year. My question is given, obviously, the drop in iron ore and more recently, Chinese billet prices, do you think that will actually have a negative impact on scrap prices in the U.S. over the next few months? That's my first question. Mark Millett Russ, do you want-- Russel Rinn Again, I think as we look forward and look out into the balance of the year, it looks to us that the supply balance is well maintained throughout. Although we've had some iron ore prices go down, the pig iron prices have remained very bullish with the disruptions out of the freight and that's really a more closer benchmark to what happens domestically for us. So I think if we look out, we don't see anything that moves the needle drastically down or drastically up. We see a pretty steady state going out through the balance of the year from this point. David Gagliano And then just a quick follow-up. Any early, early comments on the headlines this morning about the potential special investigation on steel imports under the Trade Expansion Act? Mark Millett I guess it will be too early to speculate, Dave. I think it does give you insight to the positive trade environment in Washington right now, but time will tell. Operator Our next question comes from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Jorge Beristain I guess just really following up on the Trump Buy America, could you point to any specific subsectors of products where you think that this would make a difference, that historically, they may have been supplied by imports, but now, because of these new potential regulations, there'll be a switch to American-based products? Mark Millett Well, I think obviously, energy is a big focus and as the energy markets continue to rebound -- and one has to remember, energy used to be, not too long ago, only 2 years ago, about 8% to 10% of steel demand in the States. And that is a big outlook for hot-rolled coil, certainly, for us at Columbus. So I think energy would be a principal focus there. And I think also, in the long products side of things, if you look at the heavy beam market recently, imports of what I call roll bar, just straight bar, have increased over the last few years. But most significantly, prefabricated beam has been increasing at a dramatic rate. And so there are several projects, the Hudson Yards project in New York, the Sasol chemical plant down in Louisiana. A lot of imported prefab material has come in and Buy American doctrine would certainly help that, particularly at least for government-sponsored projects. Jorge Beristain And then just on finished product imports of steel, we've been seeing they're up still pretty sharply quarter-on quarter, year-on-year about 7%. Can you speak to what's going on there with particularly the still high CRC prices in the U.S.? Are you starting to feel a little bit of import pressure at the margin just because, despite the trade cases, we're still seeing imports up year-on-year? Mark Millett We're not seeing much pressure at all, in all honesty. I think the -- absolutely, there's a little attraction there on the cold-rolled sheet, coated side because the arbitrage is grown compared to hot-rolled coil. Hot-rolled coil imports, obviously down dramatically. And despite Asian pricing for hot-band going down, that stuff just can't get in. On the coated and cold-rolled sheet side, part of that, I do believe, is demand and -- or the supply and demand balance because the coating lines are full in America today. And so there's almost a need for a slight uptick in that product line. Operator Our next question comes from Curt Woodworth with Crédit Suisse. Curtis Woodworth Mark, you talked about inflecting demand, certainly, for SBQ and merchant bar, yet it seems like the industry hasn't been able to get much price support for those products. I know that you and Gerdau rescinded a $40 per ton price increase in early April. And I think on the rebar side, I know you don't do a lot of commodity rebar, but Nucor rescinded that as well. So can you just talk about why, despite stronger demand momentum on the long products side, it hasn't really been able to get more material metal spread expansion? And do you think that there's an opportunity for any potential trade action with respect to either beams or specialty bar going forward? Mark Millett I think when you look at the merchant shapes, long bar, that side of the industry, if you look at utilization rates as an industry, yes, we're 74%, 75% or thereabouts. But I think one needs to bifurcate that into sheet and long products. Sheet is running, I'd say almost flat out, 95% today to a large degree. On the long products side, utilization rates are still -- they're improving, but they're still struggling. And so you don't have a strong sort of sellers market environment to dictate an increase in pricing and spread. So I think it's just a matter of competition. We do believe that demand is growing across virtually all steel sectors, steel markets and that will certainly improve. We're certainly seeing in SBQ -- SBQ order rate has grown dramatically. The utilization at that mill is very, very positive and so you're going to see, I think, some pricing strength in that arena. Merchants, rebar, still going to be a little challenged. Curtis Woodworth And the potential for any trade action on long products? Mark Millett Well, right now, you have a rebar case, I think pending, right, Glenn? Glenn Pushis Yes. Mark Millett And I think the market in that arena will have to take care of it and it will [indiscernible]. Operator Our next question comes from Brett Levy with Loop Capital. Brett Levy You've talked with, I don't know, some enthusiasm about the energy sector and that sort of thing. And I'm just wondering, as you look at your portfolio, is welded pipe or seamless pipe or -- is there something that sort of fits into your front-end capabilities that would make sense in terms of expansion ideas in the energy sector? Mark Millett I will answer that. As we normally do, we look at all opportunities out there. And whatever opportunities check all the boxes, we will pursue. Brett Levy Got it. And then in terms of share buybacks, are you guys still feeling fairly aggressive about that? Theresa Wagler Hey, Brett, I was going to say [indiscernible] if I help you recognize that. Brett Levy I recognize it. Theresa Wagler We were active in the quarter. We repurchased about 1.8 million shares for about $61 million and we continue to be active. We continue to be opportunistic and enter the market from time to time where it makes sense to us to do so. We still believe that it's a valuable thing to execute. Operator Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Timna Tanners I was wondering -- I know you talked a little bit already about the imports on galvanized and cold-rolled maybe because the markets are running pretty full out on those products, but there's some concern among distributors specifically about large amounts of product coming from a few countries, say, Turkey and Russia. I mean, do you think that there's a potential to continue to pursue trade cases? Or do you think we're tapped out on the flat-rolled side? Mark Millett I think the trade cases in place will -- should be enforced and obviously, the political climate in Washington is proceeding in that manner. I think a huge case is the anti-circumvention case against Vietnam. That is ongoing and should see the light of day June, July or -- this summer. I think people need to focus more, in all honesty, on the marketplace in America than worrying too much about the import level and worrying too much about iron ore is coming off. And there seems to be a commentary or view that the price [indiscernible] softening is going to occur midyear.  And perhaps, on the -- Timna, perhaps, I'm a little bit of a contrarian, but I think the market dynamics in place is -- they're strong and are certainly going to support the current pricing environment, if not more. You've got a domestic market strength that is supply-side driven today and is supported by strong and, I think, growing demand and it's going to mitigate any softness in raw materials. We mentioned, on the demand side, automotive still remains strong. It may have turned over a little bit, but it's going to remain strong for the rest of the year. Nonresidential construction is continuing to grow. Energy is coming back. All we have to do is look at the recent MSCI data, where shipments in March which I think normally, month-over-month tends to lighten up a little bit, they increased, I think, significantly, materially. And the inventory levels in the system today are at 2 months. If you look at sheet or flat roll, they're only 1.8 months which is a very, very, very low level. So supply chain inventory is very, very tight. You do have the import cases in place today and they're going to be enforced in a much stronger vein going forward. Then you have an industry with lead times stretching out. So it's, I think, a very good, positive market environment that's going to support good pricing and good spreads through the rest of the year. And it's -- I would argue that we're at a bit of a tipping point. I think inventories today are at a very precarious position. The short inventory sort of maximized turn business model or the consolidating service center industry has been accommodated these past years by a challenged market, mills with low utilization rates, lead times short and they've been able to sort of buy off the floor, almost, of the mills. And I think that's about to change. So I view the market in a very positive vein right now. Timna Tanners It will be fantastic to see the skeptics proven wrong on the scrap side and concerns over Chinese hot-rolled and the focus, again, on the U.S. market and demand will be refreshing. I guess I'll switch gears here to ask just about the war chest that you've developed and there's a lot of speculation about what you plan to do with it. I just wanted to know if you could clarify a little bit in terms of the value-added focus you've talked about. Is that more organic or acquisitive? Is there anything else you can detail to us on the way you're thinking about growth opportunities? Mark Millett Well, thanks for pointing that out, Timna. I think the strategic positioning of the company is certainly clearly demonstrating our cash flow generation capability. Up to this point, I think we've approached cash allocation in a very balanced, sort of strategic, intentional way. We've taken advantage of the capital markets over the last 18 months to reduce debt. We've continued the positive dividend profile. You saw that we increased it 8%. Theresa Wagler 11%. Mark Millett 11%, sorry, 11% this first quarter. And not only did we come up or advertise a share repurchase program, we're executing on that program going forward. And that's a $450 million program. So I think our approach -- we've demonstrated a positive approach today. With that, growth, both organic and inorganic, remains our first priority. You've seen -- we've talked about very small projects, I guess $75 million, $100 million worth of small organic projects across the company being implemented and coming onstream kind of this year, early next year, all of which have less than a 24-month payback. The Columbus paint line is a phenomenal facility, as I said earlier. That is going to further amplify the earnings capability at Columbus. And I've got to emphasize Columbus. That mill has gone through a transformation. The breadth of product or market diversification and geographic penetration is phenomenal, pushing a lot more product down the value-add stream, pushing material into Mexico. We shipped about 200,000 tons into Mexico last year and that will grow to probably 400,000 tons over the next 18 months. They penetrated the automotive arena, gaining market share dramatically. We shipped, I think, a couple hundred thousand tons in '16 and over the next 18 months, that will grow to about 400,000 tons also. And as the energy markets are coming back, the team has continued to develop better grades and so we're taking advantage of the premium of those stronger grades there in Columbus. So that mill has transformed itself and we always said that it has the potential to outearn the Butler facility which has been the ores for many years and probably the most profitable steel mill in the world. Well, we had one month in the first quarter that the Columbus guys have been [indiscernible], so that's coming to fruition. So I think the sort of organic growth is going to be material. On the inorganic side, again, not to get into specifics, the pipeline was full last year with opportunities that we assessed and it remains full. It's surprising, actually, what opportunities are coming to the table. And we will continue to assess them with a focus on value-add downstream processor that our team has showed a propensity to outperform most, a focus on pull-through volume and not forgetting that we're steel producers, first and foremost and have done an okay job in the most part and we'll continue to pursue those sorts of opportunities, too. Operator Our next question comes from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc. Philip Gibbs Is the Pittsboro mills supplying billet right now to the North American seamless tube mills? And if so, was the ramp in OCTG production that we've seen more recently here something that you benefited from on the seamless side? Glenn Pushis No. This is Glenn Pushis. We're not supplying any billet to anyone out of the Pittsboro plant. It's all being self-consumed at the plant itself. Philip Gibbs Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And Theresa, the mix within the sheet business, can you provide that? Theresa Wagler Yes, I'm sorry, Phil. I can, absolutely. So hot-rolled and pickle and oil were 884,000 tons, cold-rolled was 141,000 tons and coated was 711,000 tons. And there's a little bit more to add, I think, on the energy market. I want to make sure that we're clear. We actually are shipping to energy customers from... Glenn Pushis Well, Phil, this is Glenn. When you asked about billets, some of what we do, we take those billets and then roll them on a large mill down there in Pittsboro, so some of our customers, we do supply a rolled product to them for seamless tubing. So I don't want to be disingenuous and tell you that we're not supplying that market. We certainly are, but we don't supply any [indiscernible] billets out into that market. Philip Gibbs Okay. Yes, I'm just trying to figure out whether or not Pittsboro is supplying, I guess, the seamless tubing market. And I guess the answer is yes, but it's a little bit more a refined product that you're putting in there. Glenn Pushis Exactly correct. Theresa Wagler The three main drivers for the increase in the SBQ shipments, Phil, from an end market perspective were energy and, actually surprising, mining equipment kind of and some automotive as well because we've been gaining automotive share in Pittsboro very effectively. So those were the 3 main market drivers. Philip Gibbs Got it. And then last question here is just on the general outlook for metal spreads in the second quarter versus the first quarter, maybe anything that you can provide on that as you see it today. Mark Millett Again, we found the look too near and I think we prefer just to say, hey, we see a very positive market environment for the rest of the year on the pricing side and a very sort of stable raw material scrap profile. Operator Our next question comes from Alessandro Abate with Berenberg. Alessandro Abate I just have 2 quick questions. I mean, the market seems to be obsessed by the fact that China's steel price has come off quite a lot. And you, Mark, just have a contrarian view at the moment. Just to clear up the things from any kind of doubt related to your assumption, we're seeing the HRC is going down quite a lot in terms of ex imports to the U.S., with Korea and China completely almost disappearing. Beyond the advantage that you get from reduction of import of HRC, can you also support the view that the average steel price at import level from the rest of the exporter to the U.S. has significantly increased considering that the 2 most aggressive exporters are basically disappearing? And the second one is related to Mexico. I mean, the first indicator of the [indiscernible] risk of potential deterioration of U.S.-Mexico trade relationship is clearly the FX which has appreciated as of late. What is your view on domestic steel demand in Mexico for the next 6 months? Mark Millett Well, I'll take the Mexican question first and I'll probably forget the first question by the time I finish that. The Mexico market, at least from our perspective, is still strong and growing. They have -- well, they're still short in a big way down there. They will continue to need imports. Just with the current assets in place, you can argue whether or not people are going to continue to build that. I think they will. But nonetheless, just the current assets in place there, the consumption will -- is strong and will continue to grow. And given our location of the Columbus sheet mill having one of the, if not one, the cheapest freight into Mexico, we're very, very well positioned to benefit and exploit that growth there. So I don't see an issue with Mexico. I think the administration has softened or kind of moderated its stance. There's a recognition that we need to be good trading partners. Maybe the NAFTA agreement should be modified. I think it's been around for a long time and I think both parties will benefit from a new look at that, but I think it's going to be a prudent, pragmatic review. So I don't have any concerns, any issues with trade with Mexico. The earlier question, I think, is kind of focused on the arbitrage between domestic pricing and Asian pricing. Obviously, on the hot-rolled coil side, essentially, the duties have shut China and a lot of those folks out of the marketplace.  We're seeing a little bit of hot-rolled coil coming from other folks, but again, year-over-year, hot-rolled coil import is down significantly. The import arena, that -- it's grown year-over-year. Again, we talked about it earlier. Total sheet and coated, there, the arbitrage has grown. But also, the demand in the States is very, very strong and you've got an industry that is pretty well maxed out today. So I'm not surprised to see a little expansion in those products. Theresa Wagler If I can just quickly add, I think you made the point earlier and I think it's a very valid point that some people don't understand, there's an overfocus on China right now on hot-rolled coil prices, where if you look at European prices which they don't have the trade cases necessarily, those prices are still very high. And so to your point, the arbitrage there to bring those into the U.S. really isn't that attractive because their prices have remained much higher than China. Alessandro Abate Just a quick follow-up. I mean, what I wanted to say is that considering China is off the market at the moment, also, South Korea has been shut down at the moment, I mean, the average import price that you have is significantly lower than what the China's export price would imply. So the effect of an arbitrage which is calculated between the U.S. HRC and China HRC, has lost a lot of power. Do you agree with that? Mark Millett Sure. Absolutely. I totally agree. Operator Our next question comes from Novid Rassouli with Cowen and Company. Novid Rassouli I had a question -- I think you touched on it in a previous question -- or a couple of the previous questions, Mark, but in last quarter's conference call, you'd mentioned that supply side tightness -- you're seeing supply side tightness on the sheet side and that you expect that to be sustained. I was wondering if you can just update us on how the market has evolved since then and your current thoughts and outlook. Mark Millett Well, I, hopefully, articulated that to some degree already. The sheet arena, I think, just continues to be tight. It's somewhat balanced, I guess. You have a large sector of our industry not buying or hasn't really been buying and that's the service center industry and hence, inventories have shrunk as their shipments have increased. So I think generally, there's going to be a catch-up there over the next few months. And as I said earlier, I think the supply chain is in a precarious or at a precarious point. 1.8 months of flat-rolled products out there. I mean, it's almost unheard of.  And I would imagine that the folks are going to need -- if they're going to support the OEM customer when demand continues to grow, that industry needs to be restocked. So that onto itself is going to fuel additional demand. On top of that, demand in general, for us anyway, continues to grow. We're seeing market share growth in automotive. We're seeing growth in the energy arena. And I think it's just going to continue to go over the next couple of quarters, for sure. Novid Rassouli Right. And just to touch on the low inventories, so pricing sentiment has definitely shifted basically in the past few weeks and so traditionally, we kind of see buyers pull back a bit. But given the low inventories, I mean, are you seeing any shift in buying activity from the shift in sentiment or -- and do you expect to? Mark Millett I think we're seeing the typical profile and it's a little frustration -- frustrating, I guess, for us. But people try to anticipate where the scrap market is going and buy or order in relation to that. Again, we're not in a raw material or cost-driven environment today. We're in a supply side-driven environment. And I think we're going to see less and less of an impact of scrap here going forward on pricing. Well, we have seen a profile a couple of weeks or 3 weeks ago, folks took their feet off the order pedal a little bit and the scrap market didn't come off quite as strong as they anticipated. Pricing has not softened dramatically and we're starting to see the order rate pick back up again today. Operator Our next question comes from Alex Hacking with Citi Investment Research. Alexander Hacking Just a couple of follow-up questions on end demand, you mentioned in the press release growth from large public sector infrastructure projects. Is this something that you're already seeing? And if so, could you give us some color? Or is this something that you're anticipating once an infrastructure bill will be put in place? And then secondly, just on energy sector, if I remember right, Mark, you talked about -- that this sector could maybe get back to kind of a 5 million ton per year rate. Where do you think we're in that process right now? Is there any way to quantify the improvement in demand from that sector? Mark Millett Well, I think our conference in the [indiscernible] to the infrastructure is kind of relative to the potential build, build-out by the administration. I think we're seeing positive growth in nonresidential construction in general, though and it will continue. Theresa Wagler I just might add to that, though. We're seeing movement at the state level that really has come prior to any federal infrastructure program and we have seen some positive signs from that. And we just have anecdotal information from [indiscernible] and whatnot that there is some positive movement there for infrastructure. Mark Millett And on energy, I wouldn't be able to quantify, honestly, where we're at this moment in time, although I would suggest we're way down the curve and there's a huge runway to be attained here. Operator Our next question comes from Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank. Sean Wondrack I'm just trying -- I'm just going through some of the comments you were stating about imports. When we look at global crude steel production, right, it's up about 15 million metric tons year-over-year, with China being up about 11 million metric tons, at least through February. And then when you just look at global pricing, right, U.S. HRC is obviously the highest and then Chinese domestic HRC is obviously the lowest. And it's almost a $300 -- $270 difference at this point. What prevents -- so considering that service center is basically going through a buyer strike and, like you've been commenting, they haven't been buying, inventory levels have been getting very low, do you think they're expecting imports? Like are imports on the water since it takes 3 to 4 months to come over and they think they can just get around the tariffs? I know that service centers, a couple of them I've spoken to, put about 20% of their buy in offshore steel. So I was just kind of curious how you looked at that, thought about that dynamic. Mark Millett I'm not aware of any threat on the hot-rolled coil side from anyone. I would suggest that essentially, the hot-rolled coil arena has been effectively shut down. Any thrust would be, again, on the cold-rolled sheet and coated side of the business, as we've said earlier. So that volume is somewhat limited. A lot of that material today are kind of what I call stocked stuff coming in, the 48-wide and 60-wide material. And as you have a supply chain inventory as tight as we're today, they don't have every size and gauge [indiscernible] that our customers or that the OEMs want. And so there's a natural need for stuff produced in the United States and I think we're at that kind of sort of balance point today. And we're not threatened. We don't feel threatened by any further imports there. Sean Wondrack So that would kind of indicate that these service centers that have been buying imports would start buying American again which should be great for the market. So I guess we should look to see that in the coming quarters? Mark Millett Well, it'd be good to see some of those folks be a little more patriotic than they are, yes. Operator The next question comes from Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie. Aldo Mazzaferro I just had 2 quick questions. In the pipe market, you got this Trump initiative that seems to be focusing on melted and poured steel in the U.S. rather than rolled slabs and things like that. And I'm wondering, I think a lot of the steel that gets sold to the pipe market is coming from slabs that might be imported. I'm wondering whether you see an opportunity [indiscernible], especially with some of those pipe mills that are sitting around Texas that are underutilized [indiscernible] more materials. Is there kind of a big story in your hot-rolled coil business going to the energy that might be further accelerated by the melt-and-pour [indiscernible]? Barry Schneider Aldo, this is Barry Schneider. I would tell you that in recent meetings we've had with the administration and Department of Commerce, the pipe manufacturing in the United States have had troubles on their own in competing on a level playing field across the world. So in many cases, the materials they can get here in the United States, they are capable of vast majority of products that would be consumed here. But in some cases, when hot-rolled is coming in subsidized in the shape of a pipe or energy sector product, it's very difficult to compare or to compete with that. So we did -- we were excited to hear that the administration was considering the standard melted and poured kind of language for Buy American projects. We think that is a good utilization of American business and helping to level that playing field for people that make those products. But that will regard primarily intrastate business. So interstate business, we have to convince people we have the right products and earn that business. But this helps us through that by leveling the playing field and allowing the domestic manufacturers to have what they need, supply it right here in [indiscernible]. Aldo Mazzaferro Great. And then kind of a second question on the topic of [indiscernible], any strategy on scrap? [indiscernible] some of the assets you made to traditional lines earlier, is that mostly third-party material that you [indiscernible] by your ratio of internal [indiscernible] versus the previous in terms of the amount of scrap you sell internally versus outsiders? Barry Schneider Those yards were kind of on the periphery and certainly not within the shadow of our steel mills. So the scrap that did go from those yards had a big freight bill on it to get to our steel mills. So naturally, scrap is going to flow to the most logical freight home in most cases. So again, that -- those assets were better suited for somebody else. Aldo Mazzaferro Great. So Russ, is your strategy on scrap to try to stay slightly long, selling to the market? Or do you think you'll gravitate eventually towards self-sufficiency? Russel Rinn I think it's a combination of both, although I think our primary role is to make sure we've got the right scrap for our steel mills at the right price. That's our no. one priority, [indiscernible]. Aldo Mazzaferro Sorry. It looks like if you had one more mill, you'd probably be there. Russel Rinn Getting close. Operator Our next question comes from Matthew Fields with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Matthew Fields Just a couple of smaller things and then one sort of bigger picture. What kind of auto sheet products are you making at Columbus? Barry Schneider We continue to develop new products all the time, but we do sell advanced high-strength steels to market as well as traditional galvanized and high-strength steel members. We continue out of our Butler facility. Actually, we've been growing with our automotive team. We've been growing the participation out of Butler. And in many cases, it's lighter products that the mill's suited for. Down at Columbus, on the coated side, we do have much more capability there. The galvanizing lines were designed for some of these more modern steel applications. So we try not to get too far ahead of ourselves and we're trying to respond to what the automakers are asking us to do. And right now, that works well for the whole product mix. And as you may know, we do not do exposed automotive, but we do a vast majority of other parts of the automotive, what's going into an automobile. So we look forward to adding these newer products, but we're always trying to make sure that we're doing the best thing with our assets we can and communicating with the automakers to find where they need us to be. So it's a changing world in this steel. It's really exciting. It really is interesting metallurgically, of course, but for our product mix, it's great, as Mark said, to diversify us. Matthew Fields And then I think Theresa mentioned one of the bigger -- one of the surprising drivers of growth this quarter was mining equipment out of Pittsboro maybe specifically or maybe sort of company-wide. But can you talk about those kinds of products, customers, what kind of equipment you were supplying? Glenn Pushis Sure. This is Glenn Pushis. Most of those products go into our forging applications, so it will be sold to forge houses that then support the oil patch. So couplings, different forge applications for different types of machinery. Matthew Fields So it's more oil and gas than it is for actual mining? Glenn Pushis There's a little bit of mining. I consider Caterpillar to be mining, so yellow goods have picked up a little bit. Matthew Fields Okay. And then lastly, I think Timna asked the question about inorganic growth and you're pretty helpful on that. I know you can't sort of give away the store here, but now that you're 1.0x net leveraged which is of lowest you've been in a very long, long time, would you be willing to sort of flex your balance sheet to go after something bigger on the downstream side? Mark Millett Absolutely. I think we recognize where we're and I think we have the -- and we've been -- we've done here intentionally to build a platform or a foundation for significant growth and I think we will take advantage of that. That being said, we continue to reassess where we're and our sort of cash allocation [indiscernible]. Theresa Wagler So Matt, just to calibrate a little bit, when we talk about kind of the framework for looking at the balance sheet and the capital structure, we really gear toward net leverage of less than 3x through cycle. So with that, you can see that we've, to Mark's point, really prepared for a pretty significant growth opportunity, whether that's downstream or otherwise, as Mark mentioned earlier. Matthew Fields And then would you sort of prefer a pipe and tube manufacture that's on the structural side or maybe a more energy-focused tubular producer? Mark Millett We're looking for opportunities that will improve our sort of margin profile, that provides pull-through volume for us. Well, again, 3 avenues or 3 focus areas, as I said earlier. It's downstream, sort of value-add processing-type capability, pull-through volume, so some form of manufacturing to draw material through based on the model of New Millennium, based on the model of Vulcan, on the sort of threaded run out of Pittsboro and also just steel assets themselves. Matthew Fields When you say steel assets themselves, you mean like a new mill? Mark Millett Or existing mills that we believe we can infuse with our culture and our business model to improve their earnings profile. Operator Our next question comes from David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano I just realized the call's been going on for an hour and 10 minutes and nobody's asked the typical one-of-the-first questions I ever usually ask, short term modeling-type question. How should we be thinking about volume sequentially overall and margins per ton sequentially overall in the second quarter versus the first quarter? Theresa Wagler Well, Dave, this is Theresa and Mark's smiling very broadly and pointing at me, so I can be the bad guy. Clearly, we want to focus long term. And so I think Mark said at the profile, right now, we do expect and I think you can take whatever you want without maybe too prescriptive, but we're expecting demand to continue to increase in the various areas that we discussed. We're going to say steady. We definitely see in a positive trend. From a perspective of spreads, we do believe that the supply side really is driving flat roll pricing today versus the cost side. So one would suggest that given supply is still very tight, that would be a very constructive view on pricing for flat rolls. We're expecting to see continued construction which should help support the long products side of the equation as well as the energy market. And scrap, we believe, should stay pretty steady and moderate. You'll have [indiscernible] months here and there, but we can't predict those. Long term, if you look at the supply and the demand environment, there's no reason why there's a significant driver for it to go either significantly higher or significantly lower. So you can -- you could take from that what you will and I'm sorry, I'm not being more prescriptive. I'm sure everyone would like us to be so. David Gagliano No, that's perfect. That's very helpful. Very much appreciate the longer term approach and also what seems to me to be very encouraging, supportive commentary regarding the outlook for the market here. Operator And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett Super. Well, thank you, Rob. And again, many thanks for sharing your time with us today. We do value you as we do our customers. Any customers on the line, we'd like to certainly thank you for your support. And to our employees, I tell you, guys and girls, you did a phenomenal job in the quarter. It's you that drives the company's success and will continue to drive it forward in the future. So it's an honor to be with you all. So take care. Have a great day. Operator Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call.

Our first question comes from Seth Rosenfeld with Jefferies. Seth Rosenfeld Seth Rosenfeld from Jefferies. I have one question picking off on -- I have one quick question picking off on your realized sale prices over the last quarter. Your ASP seems like it's stronger than what we were forecasting. Can you just talk a little bit about any shift you're seeing in product mix or contract mix to help us better understand what's driving your current robust realized prices and, I guess tied to that, where we're seeing the outside strength in your sales volumes in flat steel as well? You discussed in the report some of the drivers on the long side, but I'd like to hear a bit more detail on flats there. Theresa Wagler So on average sales price perspective, Seth, you've seen a pretty significant product shift with the addition of the volume from SBQ, from our Engineered Bar Division. So that was impactful to the average sales price for the quarter as well as just the long products in general as well as some appreciation in product mix within the flat roll group. Although the paint line is just having a little bit of impact right now in Columbus, we're seeing very good strength at Columbus on the rest of the value-add side of the equation. So we're seeing an overall product shift toward the value-add side and that volume impact from long products actually helps support the average sales price being maybe higher than what you would have forecast originally. As it relates to demand for flat roll, we've seen a lot of demand, both steady demand in automotives. A lot of that's been impacting core Columbus. Construction is remaining very strong for us, but we're also seeing increased demand from the energy sector, specifically at Columbus. And that's something that we didn't expect to see as much strength in the first quarter as we've seen. Barry, is there anything else to add on an end market perspective for flat rolls? Barry Schneider Just that we continue to work on the energy products that fit our mix very well. And it's good to see the return of buying activity in that sector. Operator Our next question comes from David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano I just have a couple of quick questions. First of all, I think in your prepared remarks, you said you expect a more stabilized scrap price environment, I think, for the remainder of the year. My question is given, obviously, the drop in iron ore and more recently, Chinese billet prices, do you think that will actually have a negative impact on scrap prices in the U.S. over the next few months? That's my first question. Mark Millett Russ, do you want-- Russel Rinn Again, I think as we look forward and look out into the balance of the year, it looks to us that the supply balance is well maintained throughout. Although we've had some iron ore prices go down, the pig iron prices have remained very bullish with the disruptions out of the freight and that's really a more closer benchmark to what happens domestically for us. So I think if we look out, we don't see anything that moves the needle drastically down or drastically up. We see a pretty steady state going out through the balance of the year from this point. David Gagliano And then just a quick follow-up. Any early, early comments on the headlines this morning about the potential special investigation on steel imports under the Trade Expansion Act? Mark Millett I guess it will be too early to speculate, Dave. I think it does give you insight to the positive trade environment in Washington right now, but time will tell. Operator Our next question comes from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Jorge Beristain I guess just really following up on the Trump Buy America, could you point to any specific subsectors of products where you think that this would make a difference, that historically, they may have been supplied by imports, but now, because of these new potential regulations, there'll be a switch to American-based products? Mark Millett Well, I think obviously, energy is a big focus and as the energy markets continue to rebound -- and one has to remember, energy used to be, not too long ago, only 2 years ago, about 8% to 10% of steel demand in the States. And that is a big outlook for hot-rolled coil, certainly, for us at Columbus. So I think energy would be a principal focus there. And I think also, in the long products side of things, if you look at the heavy beam market recently, imports of what I call roll bar, just straight bar, have increased over the last few years. But most significantly, prefabricated beam has been increasing at a dramatic rate. And so there are several projects, the Hudson Yards project in New York, the Sasol chemical plant down in Louisiana. A lot of imported prefab material has come in and Buy American doctrine would certainly help that, particularly at least for government-sponsored projects. Jorge Beristain And then just on finished product imports of steel, we've been seeing they're up still pretty sharply quarter-on quarter, year-on-year about 7%. Can you speak to what's going on there with particularly the still high CRC prices in the U.S.? Are you starting to feel a little bit of import pressure at the margin just because, despite the trade cases, we're still seeing imports up year-on-year? Mark Millett We're not seeing much pressure at all, in all honesty. I think the -- absolutely, there's a little attraction there on the cold-rolled sheet, coated side because the arbitrage is grown compared to hot-rolled coil. Hot-rolled coil imports, obviously down dramatically. And despite Asian pricing for hot-band going down, that stuff just can't get in. On the coated and cold-rolled sheet side, part of that, I do believe, is demand and -- or the supply and demand balance because the coating lines are full in America today. And so there's almost a need for a slight uptick in that product line. Operator Our next question comes from Curt Woodworth with Crédit Suisse. Curtis Woodworth Mark, you talked about inflecting demand, certainly, for SBQ and merchant bar, yet it seems like the industry hasn't been able to get much price support for those products. I know that you and Gerdau rescinded a $40 per ton price increase in early April. And I think on the rebar side, I know you don't do a lot of commodity rebar, but Nucor rescinded that as well. So can you just talk about why, despite stronger demand momentum on the long products side, it hasn't really been able to get more material metal spread expansion? And do you think that there's an opportunity for any potential trade action with respect to either beams or specialty bar going forward? Mark Millett I think when you look at the merchant shapes, long bar, that side of the industry, if you look at utilization rates as an industry, yes, we're 74%, 75% or thereabouts. But I think one needs to bifurcate that into sheet and long products. Sheet is running, I'd say almost flat out, 95% today to a large degree. On the long products side, utilization rates are still -- they're improving, but they're still struggling. And so you don't have a strong sort of sellers market environment to dictate an increase in pricing and spread. So I think it's just a matter of competition. We do believe that demand is growing across virtually all steel sectors, steel markets and that will certainly improve. We're certainly seeing in SBQ -- SBQ order rate has grown dramatically. The utilization at that mill is very, very positive and so you're going to see, I think, some pricing strength in that arena. Merchants, rebar, still going to be a little challenged. Curtis Woodworth And the potential for any trade action on long products? Mark Millett Well, right now, you have a rebar case, I think pending, right, Glenn? Glenn Pushis Yes. Mark Millett And I think the market in that arena will have to take care of it and it will [indiscernible]. Operator Our next question comes from Brett Levy with Loop Capital. Brett Levy You've talked with, I don't know, some enthusiasm about the energy sector and that sort of thing. And I'm just wondering, as you look at your portfolio, is welded pipe or seamless pipe or -- is there something that sort of fits into your front-end capabilities that would make sense in terms of expansion ideas in the energy sector? Mark Millett I will answer that. As we normally do, we look at all opportunities out there. And whatever opportunities check all the boxes, we will pursue. Brett Levy Got it. And then in terms of share buybacks, are you guys still feeling fairly aggressive about that? Theresa Wagler Hey, Brett, I was going to say [indiscernible] if I help you recognize that. Brett Levy I recognize it. Theresa Wagler We were active in the quarter. We repurchased about 1.8 million shares for about $61 million and we continue to be active. We continue to be opportunistic and enter the market from time to time where it makes sense to us to do so. We still believe that it's a valuable thing to execute. Operator Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Timna Tanners I was wondering -- I know you talked a little bit already about the imports on galvanized and cold-rolled maybe because the markets are running pretty full out on those products, but there's some concern among distributors specifically about large amounts of product coming from a few countries, say, Turkey and Russia. I mean, do you think that there's a potential to continue to pursue trade cases? Or do you think we're tapped out on the flat-rolled side? Mark Millett I think the trade cases in place will -- should be enforced and obviously, the political climate in Washington is proceeding in that manner. I think a huge case is the anti-circumvention case against Vietnam. That is ongoing and should see the light of day June, July or -- this summer. I think people need to focus more, in all honesty, on the marketplace in America than worrying too much about the import level and worrying too much about iron ore is coming off. And there seems to be a commentary or view that the price [indiscernible] softening is going to occur midyear.  And perhaps, on the -- Timna, perhaps, I'm a little bit of a contrarian, but I think the market dynamics in place is -- they're strong and are certainly going to support the current pricing environment, if not more. You've got a domestic market strength that is supply-side driven today and is supported by strong and, I think, growing demand and it's going to mitigate any softness in raw materials. We mentioned, on the demand side, automotive still remains strong. It may have turned over a little bit, but it's going to remain strong for the rest of the year. Nonresidential construction is continuing to grow. Energy is coming back. All we have to do is look at the recent MSCI data, where shipments in March which I think normally, month-over-month tends to lighten up a little bit, they increased, I think, significantly, materially. And the inventory levels in the system today are at 2 months. If you look at sheet or flat roll, they're only 1.8 months which is a very, very, very low level. So supply chain inventory is very, very tight. You do have the import cases in place today and they're going to be enforced in a much stronger vein going forward. Then you have an industry with lead times stretching out. So it's, I think, a very good, positive market environment that's going to support good pricing and good spreads through the rest of the year. And it's -- I would argue that we're at a bit of a tipping point. I think inventories today are at a very precarious position. The short inventory sort of maximized turn business model or the consolidating service center industry has been accommodated these past years by a challenged market, mills with low utilization rates, lead times short and they've been able to sort of buy off the floor, almost, of the mills. And I think that's about to change. So I view the market in a very positive vein right now. Timna Tanners It will be fantastic to see the skeptics proven wrong on the scrap side and concerns over Chinese hot-rolled and the focus, again, on the U.S. market and demand will be refreshing. I guess I'll switch gears here to ask just about the war chest that you've developed and there's a lot of speculation about what you plan to do with it. I just wanted to know if you could clarify a little bit in terms of the value-added focus you've talked about. Is that more organic or acquisitive? Is there anything else you can detail to us on the way you're thinking about growth opportunities? Mark Millett Well, thanks for pointing that out, Timna. I think the strategic positioning of the company is certainly clearly demonstrating our cash flow generation capability. Up to this point, I think we've approached cash allocation in a very balanced, sort of strategic, intentional way. We've taken advantage of the capital markets over the last 18 months to reduce debt. We've continued the positive dividend profile. You saw that we increased it 8%. Theresa Wagler 11%. Mark Millett 11%, sorry, 11% this first quarter. And not only did we come up or advertise a share repurchase program, we're executing on that program going forward. And that's a $450 million program. So I think our approach -- we've demonstrated a positive approach today. With that, growth, both organic and inorganic, remains our first priority. You've seen -- we've talked about very small projects, I guess $75 million, $100 million worth of small organic projects across the company being implemented and coming onstream kind of this year, early next year, all of which have less than a 24-month payback. The Columbus paint line is a phenomenal facility, as I said earlier. That is going to further amplify the earnings capability at Columbus. And I've got to emphasize Columbus. That mill has gone through a transformation. The breadth of product or market diversification and geographic penetration is phenomenal, pushing a lot more product down the value-add stream, pushing material into Mexico. We shipped about 200,000 tons into Mexico last year and that will grow to probably 400,000 tons over the next 18 months. They penetrated the automotive arena, gaining market share dramatically. We shipped, I think, a couple hundred thousand tons in '16 and over the next 18 months, that will grow to about 400,000 tons also. And as the energy markets are coming back, the team has continued to develop better grades and so we're taking advantage of the premium of those stronger grades there in Columbus. So that mill has transformed itself and we always said that it has the potential to outearn the Butler facility which has been the ores for many years and probably the most profitable steel mill in the world. Well, we had one month in the first quarter that the Columbus guys have been [indiscernible], so that's coming to fruition. So I think the sort of organic growth is going to be material. On the inorganic side, again, not to get into specifics, the pipeline was full last year with opportunities that we assessed and it remains full. It's surprising, actually, what opportunities are coming to the table. And we will continue to assess them with a focus on value-add downstream processor that our team has showed a propensity to outperform most, a focus on pull-through volume and not forgetting that we're steel producers, first and foremost and have done an okay job in the most part and we'll continue to pursue those sorts of opportunities, too. Operator Our next question comes from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc. Philip Gibbs Is the Pittsboro mills supplying billet right now to the North American seamless tube mills? And if so, was the ramp in OCTG production that we've seen more recently here something that you benefited from on the seamless side? Glenn Pushis No. This is Glenn Pushis. We're not supplying any billet to anyone out of the Pittsboro plant. It's all being self-consumed at the plant itself. Philip Gibbs Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And Theresa, the mix within the sheet business, can you provide that? Theresa Wagler Yes, I'm sorry, Phil. I can, absolutely. So hot-rolled and pickle and oil were 884,000 tons, cold-rolled was 141,000 tons and coated was 711,000 tons. And there's a little bit more to add, I think, on the energy market. I want to make sure that we're clear. We actually are shipping to energy customers from... Glenn Pushis Well, Phil, this is Glenn. When you asked about billets, some of what we do, we take those billets and then roll them on a large mill down there in Pittsboro, so some of our customers, we do supply a rolled product to them for seamless tubing. So I don't want to be disingenuous and tell you that we're not supplying that market. We certainly are, but we don't supply any [indiscernible] billets out into that market. Philip Gibbs Okay. Yes, I'm just trying to figure out whether or not Pittsboro is supplying, I guess, the seamless tubing market. And I guess the answer is yes, but it's a little bit more a refined product that you're putting in there. Glenn Pushis Exactly correct. Theresa Wagler The three main drivers for the increase in the SBQ shipments, Phil, from an end market perspective were energy and, actually surprising, mining equipment kind of and some automotive as well because we've been gaining automotive share in Pittsboro very effectively. So those were the 3 main market drivers. Philip Gibbs Got it. And then last question here is just on the general outlook for metal spreads in the second quarter versus the first quarter, maybe anything that you can provide on that as you see it today. Mark Millett Again, we found the look too near and I think we prefer just to say, hey, we see a very positive market environment for the rest of the year on the pricing side and a very sort of stable raw material scrap profile. Operator Our next question comes from Alessandro Abate with Berenberg. Alessandro Abate I just have 2 quick questions. I mean, the market seems to be obsessed by the fact that China's steel price has come off quite a lot. And you, Mark, just have a contrarian view at the moment. Just to clear up the things from any kind of doubt related to your assumption, we're seeing the HRC is going down quite a lot in terms of ex imports to the U.S., with Korea and China completely almost disappearing. Beyond the advantage that you get from reduction of import of HRC, can you also support the view that the average steel price at import level from the rest of the exporter to the U.S. has significantly increased considering that the 2 most aggressive exporters are basically disappearing? And the second one is related to Mexico. I mean, the first indicator of the [indiscernible] risk of potential deterioration of U.S.-Mexico trade relationship is clearly the FX which has appreciated as of late. What is your view on domestic steel demand in Mexico for the next 6 months? Mark Millett Well, I'll take the Mexican question first and I'll probably forget the first question by the time I finish that. The Mexico market, at least from our perspective, is still strong and growing. They have -- well, they're still short in a big way down there. They will continue to need imports. Just with the current assets in place, you can argue whether or not people are going to continue to build that. I think they will. But nonetheless, just the current assets in place there, the consumption will -- is strong and will continue to grow. And given our location of the Columbus sheet mill having one of the, if not one, the cheapest freight into Mexico, we're very, very well positioned to benefit and exploit that growth there. So I don't see an issue with Mexico. I think the administration has softened or kind of moderated its stance. There's a recognition that we need to be good trading partners. Maybe the NAFTA agreement should be modified. I think it's been around for a long time and I think both parties will benefit from a new look at that, but I think it's going to be a prudent, pragmatic review. So I don't have any concerns, any issues with trade with Mexico. The earlier question, I think, is kind of focused on the arbitrage between domestic pricing and Asian pricing. Obviously, on the hot-rolled coil side, essentially, the duties have shut China and a lot of those folks out of the marketplace.  We're seeing a little bit of hot-rolled coil coming from other folks, but again, year-over-year, hot-rolled coil import is down significantly. The import arena, that -- it's grown year-over-year. Again, we talked about it earlier. Total sheet and coated, there, the arbitrage has grown. But also, the demand in the States is very, very strong and you've got an industry that is pretty well maxed out today. So I'm not surprised to see a little expansion in those products. Theresa Wagler If I can just quickly add, I think you made the point earlier and I think it's a very valid point that some people don't understand, there's an overfocus on China right now on hot-rolled coil prices, where if you look at European prices which they don't have the trade cases necessarily, those prices are still very high. And so to your point, the arbitrage there to bring those into the U.S. really isn't that attractive because their prices have remained much higher than China. Alessandro Abate Just a quick follow-up. I mean, what I wanted to say is that considering China is off the market at the moment, also, South Korea has been shut down at the moment, I mean, the average import price that you have is significantly lower than what the China's export price would imply. So the effect of an arbitrage which is calculated between the U.S. HRC and China HRC, has lost a lot of power. Do you agree with that? Mark Millett Sure. Absolutely. I totally agree. Operator Our next question comes from Novid Rassouli with Cowen and Company. Novid Rassouli I had a question -- I think you touched on it in a previous question -- or a couple of the previous questions, Mark, but in last quarter's conference call, you'd mentioned that supply side tightness -- you're seeing supply side tightness on the sheet side and that you expect that to be sustained. I was wondering if you can just update us on how the market has evolved since then and your current thoughts and outlook. Mark Millett Well, I, hopefully, articulated that to some degree already. The sheet arena, I think, just continues to be tight. It's somewhat balanced, I guess. You have a large sector of our industry not buying or hasn't really been buying and that's the service center industry and hence, inventories have shrunk as their shipments have increased. So I think generally, there's going to be a catch-up there over the next few months. And as I said earlier, I think the supply chain is in a precarious or at a precarious point. 1.8 months of flat-rolled products out there. I mean, it's almost unheard of.  And I would imagine that the folks are going to need -- if they're going to support the OEM customer when demand continues to grow, that industry needs to be restocked. So that onto itself is going to fuel additional demand. On top of that, demand in general, for us anyway, continues to grow. We're seeing market share growth in automotive. We're seeing growth in the energy arena. And I think it's just going to continue to go over the next couple of quarters, for sure. Novid Rassouli Right. And just to touch on the low inventories, so pricing sentiment has definitely shifted basically in the past few weeks and so traditionally, we kind of see buyers pull back a bit. But given the low inventories, I mean, are you seeing any shift in buying activity from the shift in sentiment or -- and do you expect to? Mark Millett I think we're seeing the typical profile and it's a little frustration -- frustrating, I guess, for us. But people try to anticipate where the scrap market is going and buy or order in relation to that. Again, we're not in a raw material or cost-driven environment today. We're in a supply side-driven environment. And I think we're going to see less and less of an impact of scrap here going forward on pricing. Well, we have seen a profile a couple of weeks or 3 weeks ago, folks took their feet off the order pedal a little bit and the scrap market didn't come off quite as strong as they anticipated. Pricing has not softened dramatically and we're starting to see the order rate pick back up again today. Operator Our next question comes from Alex Hacking with Citi Investment Research. Alexander Hacking Just a couple of follow-up questions on end demand, you mentioned in the press release growth from large public sector infrastructure projects. Is this something that you're already seeing? And if so, could you give us some color? Or is this something that you're anticipating once an infrastructure bill will be put in place? And then secondly, just on energy sector, if I remember right, Mark, you talked about -- that this sector could maybe get back to kind of a 5 million ton per year rate. Where do you think we're in that process right now? Is there any way to quantify the improvement in demand from that sector? Mark Millett Well, I think our conference in the [indiscernible] to the infrastructure is kind of relative to the potential build, build-out by the administration. I think we're seeing positive growth in nonresidential construction in general, though and it will continue. Theresa Wagler I just might add to that, though. We're seeing movement at the state level that really has come prior to any federal infrastructure program and we have seen some positive signs from that. And we just have anecdotal information from [indiscernible] and whatnot that there is some positive movement there for infrastructure. Mark Millett And on energy, I wouldn't be able to quantify, honestly, where we're at this moment in time, although I would suggest we're way down the curve and there's a huge runway to be attained here. Operator Our next question comes from Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank. Sean Wondrack I'm just trying -- I'm just going through some of the comments you were stating about imports. When we look at global crude steel production, right, it's up about 15 million metric tons year-over-year, with China being up about 11 million metric tons, at least through February. And then when you just look at global pricing, right, U.S. HRC is obviously the highest and then Chinese domestic HRC is obviously the lowest. And it's almost a $300 -- $270 difference at this point. What prevents -- so considering that service center is basically going through a buyer strike and, like you've been commenting, they haven't been buying, inventory levels have been getting very low, do you think they're expecting imports? Like are imports on the water since it takes 3 to 4 months to come over and they think they can just get around the tariffs? I know that service centers, a couple of them I've spoken to, put about 20% of their buy in offshore steel. So I was just kind of curious how you looked at that, thought about that dynamic. Mark Millett I'm not aware of any threat on the hot-rolled coil side from anyone. I would suggest that essentially, the hot-rolled coil arena has been effectively shut down. Any thrust would be, again, on the cold-rolled sheet and coated side of the business, as we've said earlier. So that volume is somewhat limited. A lot of that material today are kind of what I call stocked stuff coming in, the 48-wide and 60-wide material. And as you have a supply chain inventory as tight as we're today, they don't have every size and gauge [indiscernible] that our customers or that the OEMs want. And so there's a natural need for stuff produced in the United States and I think we're at that kind of sort of balance point today. And we're not threatened. We don't feel threatened by any further imports there. Sean Wondrack So that would kind of indicate that these service centers that have been buying imports would start buying American again which should be great for the market. So I guess we should look to see that in the coming quarters? Mark Millett Well, it'd be good to see some of those folks be a little more patriotic than they are, yes. Operator The next question comes from Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie. Aldo Mazzaferro I just had 2 quick questions. In the pipe market, you got this Trump initiative that seems to be focusing on melted and poured steel in the U.S. rather than rolled slabs and things like that. And I'm wondering, I think a lot of the steel that gets sold to the pipe market is coming from slabs that might be imported. I'm wondering whether you see an opportunity [indiscernible], especially with some of those pipe mills that are sitting around Texas that are underutilized [indiscernible] more materials. Is there kind of a big story in your hot-rolled coil business going to the energy that might be further accelerated by the melt-and-pour [indiscernible]? Barry Schneider Aldo, this is Barry Schneider. I would tell you that in recent meetings we've had with the administration and Department of Commerce, the pipe manufacturing in the United States have had troubles on their own in competing on a level playing field across the world. So in many cases, the materials they can get here in the United States, they are capable of vast majority of products that would be consumed here. But in some cases, when hot-rolled is coming in subsidized in the shape of a pipe or energy sector product, it's very difficult to compare or to compete with that. So we did -- we were excited to hear that the administration was considering the standard melted and poured kind of language for Buy American projects. We think that is a good utilization of American business and helping to level that playing field for people that make those products. But that will regard primarily intrastate business. So interstate business, we have to convince people we have the right products and earn that business. But this helps us through that by leveling the playing field and allowing the domestic manufacturers to have what they need, supply it right here in [indiscernible]. Aldo Mazzaferro Great. And then kind of a second question on the topic of [indiscernible], any strategy on scrap? [indiscernible] some of the assets you made to traditional lines earlier, is that mostly third-party material that you [indiscernible] by your ratio of internal [indiscernible] versus the previous in terms of the amount of scrap you sell internally versus outsiders? Barry Schneider Those yards were kind of on the periphery and certainly not within the shadow of our steel mills. So the scrap that did go from those yards had a big freight bill on it to get to our steel mills. So naturally, scrap is going to flow to the most logical freight home in most cases. So again, that -- those assets were better suited for somebody else. Aldo Mazzaferro Great. So Russ, is your strategy on scrap to try to stay slightly long, selling to the market? Or do you think you'll gravitate eventually towards self-sufficiency? Russel Rinn I think it's a combination of both, although I think our primary role is to make sure we've got the right scrap for our steel mills at the right price. That's our no. one priority, [indiscernible]. Aldo Mazzaferro Sorry. It looks like if you had one more mill, you'd probably be there. Russel Rinn Getting close. Operator Our next question comes from Matthew Fields with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Matthew Fields Just a couple of smaller things and then one sort of bigger picture. What kind of auto sheet products are you making at Columbus? Barry Schneider We continue to develop new products all the time, but we do sell advanced high-strength steels to market as well as traditional galvanized and high-strength steel members. We continue out of our Butler facility. Actually, we've been growing with our automotive team. We've been growing the participation out of Butler. And in many cases, it's lighter products that the mill's suited for. Down at Columbus, on the coated side, we do have much more capability there. The galvanizing lines were designed for some of these more modern steel applications. So we try not to get too far ahead of ourselves and we're trying to respond to what the automakers are asking us to do. And right now, that works well for the whole product mix. And as you may know, we do not do exposed automotive, but we do a vast majority of other parts of the automotive, what's going into an automobile. So we look forward to adding these newer products, but we're always trying to make sure that we're doing the best thing with our assets we can and communicating with the automakers to find where they need us to be. So it's a changing world in this steel. It's really exciting. It really is interesting metallurgically, of course, but for our product mix, it's great, as Mark said, to diversify us. Matthew Fields And then I think Theresa mentioned one of the bigger -- one of the surprising drivers of growth this quarter was mining equipment out of Pittsboro maybe specifically or maybe sort of company-wide. But can you talk about those kinds of products, customers, what kind of equipment you were supplying? Glenn Pushis Sure. This is Glenn Pushis. Most of those products go into our forging applications, so it will be sold to forge houses that then support the oil patch. So couplings, different forge applications for different types of machinery. Matthew Fields So it's more oil and gas than it is for actual mining? Glenn Pushis There's a little bit of mining. I consider Caterpillar to be mining, so yellow goods have picked up a little bit. Matthew Fields Okay. And then lastly, I think Timna asked the question about inorganic growth and you're pretty helpful on that. I know you can't sort of give away the store here, but now that you're 1.0x net leveraged which is of lowest you've been in a very long, long time, would you be willing to sort of flex your balance sheet to go after something bigger on the downstream side? Mark Millett Absolutely. I think we recognize where we're and I think we have the -- and we've been -- we've done here intentionally to build a platform or a foundation for significant growth and I think we will take advantage of that. That being said, we continue to reassess where we're and our sort of cash allocation [indiscernible]. Theresa Wagler So Matt, just to calibrate a little bit, when we talk about kind of the framework for looking at the balance sheet and the capital structure, we really gear toward net leverage of less than 3x through cycle. So with that, you can see that we've, to Mark's point, really prepared for a pretty significant growth opportunity, whether that's downstream or otherwise, as Mark mentioned earlier. Matthew Fields And then would you sort of prefer a pipe and tube manufacture that's on the structural side or maybe a more energy-focused tubular producer? Mark Millett We're looking for opportunities that will improve our sort of margin profile, that provides pull-through volume for us. Well, again, 3 avenues or 3 focus areas, as I said earlier. It's downstream, sort of value-add processing-type capability, pull-through volume, so some form of manufacturing to draw material through based on the model of New Millennium, based on the model of Vulcan, on the sort of threaded run out of Pittsboro and also just steel assets themselves. Matthew Fields When you say steel assets themselves, you mean like a new mill? Mark Millett Or existing mills that we believe we can infuse with our culture and our business model to improve their earnings profile. Operator Our next question comes from David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano I just realized the call's been going on for an hour and 10 minutes and nobody's asked the typical one-of-the-first questions I ever usually ask, short term modeling-type question. How should we be thinking about volume sequentially overall and margins per ton sequentially overall in the second quarter versus the first quarter? Theresa Wagler Well, Dave, this is Theresa and Mark's smiling very broadly and pointing at me, so I can be the bad guy. Clearly, we want to focus long term. And so I think Mark said at the profile, right now, we do expect and I think you can take whatever you want without maybe too prescriptive, but we're expecting demand to continue to increase in the various areas that we discussed. We're going to say steady. We definitely see in a positive trend. From a perspective of spreads, we do believe that the supply side really is driving flat roll pricing today versus the cost side. So one would suggest that given supply is still very tight, that would be a very constructive view on pricing for flat rolls. We're expecting to see continued construction which should help support the long products side of the equation as well as the energy market. And scrap, we believe, should stay pretty steady and moderate. You'll have [indiscernible] months here and there, but we can't predict those. Long term, if you look at the supply and the demand environment, there's no reason why there's a significant driver for it to go either significantly higher or significantly lower. So you can -- you could take from that what you will and I'm sorry, I'm not being more prescriptive. I'm sure everyone would like us to be so. David Gagliano No, that's perfect. That's very helpful. Very much appreciate the longer term approach and also what seems to me to be very encouraging, supportive commentary regarding the outlook for the market here. Operator And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett Super. Well, thank you, Rob. And again, many thanks for sharing your time with us today. We do value you as we do our customers. Any customers on the line, we'd like to certainly thank you for your support. And to our employees, I tell you, guys and girls, you did a phenomenal job in the quarter. It's you that drives the company's success and will continue to drive it forward in the future. So it's an honor to be with you all. So take care. Have a great day. Operator Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call.
