Welcome to the Mattel Incorporated first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\'s conference, David Zbojniewicz, \u200eVice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Zbojniewicz, you may begin. David Zbojniewicz Thank you, Latif. And good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Margo Georgiadis, Mattel’s Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel’s President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Farr, Mattel’s Chief Financial Officer. As you know, this afternoon we reported Mattel’s 2017 first quarter financial results. We will begin today’s call with Margo, Richard and Kevin providing commentary on our results and then we will take your questions. To help guide our discussion, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion and our slide presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures, such as gross sales, adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross profit, adjusted selling and administrative expenses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted earnings/loss per share and constant currency. Our earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures. The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release and slide presentation. And both documents are available in the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines.  These statements are based on currently available information and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.  We describe some of these uncertainties in the risk factors section of our 2016 annual operating report on Form 10-K, our 2016 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings we make from the SEC from time to time as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.  Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Margo. Margaret Georgiadis Thank you, Dave. And welcome, everyone, to our call. We plan to cover a lot today, but let me start by saying that I’m truly honored to lead this iconic company. This is a company with a deep purpose to inspire the wonder of childhood as the global leader in learning and development through play.  We have an opportunity to shape the next generation children that are more creative, collaborative, confident, resilient, and open to all life’s possibilities. I have spent my first 60 days deeply understanding what\'s working well and where we must improve to deliver stronger performance and capitalize on our many opportunities. We’ve been undertaking a wide-ranging review of our business and are leaving no stone unturned as we look at actions to drive revenue, improve profitability, and create long-term value for our shareholders. This work is still ongoing and I will report back to all of you with more details on our strategies and plans at an investor event we will host in New York in mid-June. In the meantime, I\'ll give you my thoughts on the first quarter, the remainder of 2017, and some of my early observations about the opportunities for Mattel that will drive future growth. So, let’s start with the first quarter. Our first quarter results came in below our expectations. Gross sales in the first quarter were down 15% and gross margin came in at 37.9%. We view these results as unacceptable relative to what Mattel is capable of. Going into Q1, which is a seasonally light quarter, we expected lower revenue and gross margin because of the retail inventory overhang coming out of the holiday period, a lighter entertainment slate, declines in our doll portfolio, a few foreign exchange adjustments, as well as some other factors. What we did not expect was a prolonged impact from the retail inventory overhang and the resulting slower pace of retail reorders. These lower-than-expected sales had a material impact on our ability to efficiently absorb our supply chain fixed costs. I should note that the retail inventory overhang was essentially isolated to North America and a few markets in Europe, while Latin America and Asia-Pacific continued strong growth. In addition, we decided to proactively take action on a few ancillary brands to clean up our own inventory, and as a result incurred a higher obsolescence expense. Clearly, we are disappointed with our first quarter results and recognize we have a lot of work to do to improve execution across our portfolio. At the same time, we remain very encouraged by our progress revitalizing our core brands, which continue to win in a very competitive marketplace. POS, which we track at wholesale, shows Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price all continuing their positive trends in the first quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, emerging markets continue to demonstrate strong growth and long-term potential, particularly Asia-Pacific and Latin America. We are confident we have worked through most of our inventory issues and we should begin to see the benefits of scale and our cost savings programs as we move forward. I also want to be fully transparent about a few areas for improvement. For example, we have not fully regained the loss of momentum in American Girl and have a lot of work to do to capture the full potential of this incredible brand.  And Monster High, which was in recent years a large and highly profitable business, continues to be a drag on our results. As the company\'s new CEO, it is my responsibility to ensure we are clear about what\'s working and what\'s not working and ensure we effectively manage through these issues and set an aggressive, but realistic path forward. In light of our Q1 results, we are updating our expectations for the full year. We now expect full year revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit range and adjusted operating margins to be flat as compared to prior year. We will have a better picture of how the year will shape up, based on the initial response to Cars 3. We are very excited to reintroduce this iconic Disney franchise to a whole new generation of consumers. The film’s staggered worldwide release schedule begins late this quarter, which should give us the ability to see how customer takeaway is tracking and adjust to retail expectations going into the holidays. We are continuing to invest in our business to deliver on our growth initiatives and we remain focused on optimizing resources to provide the financial flexibility to support growth investment and fund our capital deployment initiatives, including the dividend.  Kevin will expand on this guidance and capital deployment later during the call. Over the last two months, my team and I have focused on building a roadmap to accelerate our progress against our five strategic priorities, which we believe will meaningfully grow the business. We will have much more time to share during our investor meeting in New York, but let me take a moment to quickly frame up some of my thoughts on each priority now. First, our core brands have a large opportunity to unlock growth by transitioning to multidimensional systems of play that integrate physical and digital worlds. Our global scale and accessible price points offer us a unique position to deliver these connected systems. The value propositions for each system will center on big ideas that millennial parents and kids care deeply about and leverage compelling content and experiences to create ongoing conversations and deep relationships. These next generation power brands will extend toy purchases and unlock adjacent revenue streams in areas such as content, gaming, licensing, and experiences. A great example of this systems approach is Hot Wheels. Hot Wheels were designed to ignite and nurture the creator and challenger spirit that lies within every kid to help them reach their true potential. There are endless possibilities with connected track and construction systems, technology-enabled cars, gamification and communities of passionate fans. We already have great response to new products, such as Hot Wheels AI and our Hot Wheels Games. The future is about integrating digital across our product lines and unlocking more expansive levels of play and community experiences, both for individuals and even teams. Fully developing the potential of these next generation power brands requires embedding a new set of capabilities across our business. We’re hiring new talent, upgrading our technology infrastructure, and forming new partnerships to accelerate our progress. Turning to our second strategic priority, we are strengthening how our toy box can significantly increase our innovation pipeline. We are proud of the progress we have made with our licensed entertainment partnerships. At the same time, we want to create more differentiated partnerships, based on deep consumer and category insights, tech-enabled designs, best-in-class manufacturing, and strong global distribution. We also see a big opportunity to develop a more robust content co-creation model. In addition, we are building a growing pipeline of tech-enabled products that capitalize on new play patterns, allow us to extend beyond traditional toy age ranges and serve as the inspiration for more creative uses of technology throughout all of our brands. Third, given the enormous untapped potential, we want to increase our momentum in emerging markets with tailored product lines and strategic partnerships. Our recently announced partnerships in China with Babytree, the largest online site in the world for new moms, and Alibaba will allow us to accelerate our strong growth in China. Working with these leading partners, Mattel can more quickly become the thought leader in learning and development through play and reshape the engagement model for parents and kids in the most mobile and digital first region of the world. We plan to leverage this model to expand more quickly and efficiently across other top Asian markets, such as India and Indonesia. Fourth, our commercial team is always been a strength to Mattel, with our early move to a global model and heritage of deep local market insight and entrepreneurialism. At the same time, we can strengthen the performance of our top brands across markets, by driving tighter standards for category development and retail execution, particularly omni-channel and e-commerce. As part of this, we need to continue to upgrade our capabilities in areas such as digital engagement and commerce, merchandising differentiation, demand forecasting and inventory management. Each of these is critical to staying in step with the shifting consumer preferences and our retail partner needs. And finally, we remain committed to continuous cost improvement across our business. In addition to our existing $240 million program, we already see incremental opportunities to operate more efficiently. We\'re looking at new ways to capture value in areas such as SKU rationalization, more expansive automation, and optimizing our manufacturing to enable our strategy, both owned and outsourced. Let me end by saying our first quarter results are disappointing and not a reflection of the significant potential we see ahead. As we continue to carefully evaluate the business and update our strategic plans, we recognize we have a lot of work to do to successfully position Mattel for the future, but we see a clear path to driving sustained top line growth and regaining operating margins of 15% plus over time. Throughout my career, I have set and delivered on aggressive, yet achievable expectations in fast paced and competitive environment. I am confident I can do that here again at Mattel. I am excited to work with the talented team across Mattel to win in the marketplace and deliver on our mission and long-term objectives, and I\'m particularly excited about the partnership with Richard. And I want to thank him for his support during my on-boarding process. I look forward to meeting you, our investors, and providing updates on our progress at our investor events in June. I’ll now turn the call over to Richard. Richard Dickson Thank you, Margo. Clearly, the first quarter results were disappointing. And given the impact on the results, I thought it would be important to provide more color on retail inventory.  When you look at our sales by region, you can clearly see that the retail inventory overhang was essentially isolated to North America and Europe. Asia-Pacific and Latin America saw minimal impact, with Asia-Pacific sales up significantly. And now that most of the inventory issue is behind us, we should begin to see sales reflect the real underlying momentum of the business, as we pivot to the second quarter and build towards a strong second half. The impact of the inventory overhang was also felt across several of our key core brands, even those that continue to have strong consumer takeaway. Barbie unfortunately is the best example of how this played out in the quarter. Despite solid Q1 POS in both regions, Barbie sales were down significantly in North America, while actually up mid-single digits internationally. And as you look back on the prior year for additional context, we had Barbie POS building throughout 2016 with retailers increasing shelf space and promotional support. Retail confidence and retail inventory going into the holiday season was justifiably high. And while POS remained strong in the holiday, the significant category slowdown in December, combined with the seasonally light first quarter, simply meant there was no need for retailers to reorder and take additional inventory. For the most part, this situation was also duplicated with Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels.  Now, to be fair, not all of our brands were impacted to the same extent or for the same reason. Mega retail inventory is high and impacted reorders, mainly due to some bets on licensed properties which didn\'t meet performance expectations. And while expected, American Girl sales slowed due to some comps and the phased launch of our new contemporary characters line. We clearly have work to do and remain focused on getting it right. And as we look ahead, let me take a few moments and share some tangible progress that demonstrates why we believe we’re on the right track. As you know, we had good business momentum in our key core brands coming into 2017. And our internal analysis, which is tracked at wholesale, shows this trend continuing in the first quarter. Key core brand POS remained positive, with Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price all achieving solid mid-single digit growth. So, let me share with you a few specific examples of what consumers will see this year with these brands. Let\'s start with Barbie. There are three areas that we’re focusing on in 2017 that make me feel confident with this brand. The first example is the buildout of our basic fashion doll lines with greater choice of ethnicity, size and scale. Barbie’s fashionista segment continues to exceed expectations both with consumers and garner industry recognition, winning Toy of the Year in the Doll of the Year category, an award Barbie ironically has never won until now. The second example is the way we’re leaning into content with the brand. Barbie is moving beyond the standard DVD business model and into specific episodic content for younger and older age Barbie girls, episodic content that will be available across the entire spectrum of digital distribution, allowing girls to engage with the brand whenever and wherever and however they want. And the third demonstration of Barbie’s resilience and category expansion has been our efforts in recapturing the hearts of younger girls. We’re continuing our successful rollout of Dreamtopia, with the specific purpose of expanding Barbie’s open ended play pattern into the fantasy realm and attracting the younger girl. This line has done well and will be supported this year by new content and distributed in a new way, premiering on YouTube Kids with amazing placement and support from YouTube. With Fisher-Price, we have seen steady growth and are continuing our work in reestablishing the brand’s roots as the premier child development company. As consumers engage with this brand, they\'ll see a more simplified message, products that offer real solutions to today\'s parents, packaging changes that call out the developmental benefits more clearly and increased digital consumer experiences. Our baby gear, infant and preschool lines will get a boost from a new innovative product lineup and new marketing campaigns focused on sleep solutions, child development and active play. One area I\'m particularly excited about is how we continue to effectively leverage technology at Fisher-Price. In 2017, you will see the third generation of the hit line BeatBo, a second year of the successful [indiscernible] and this year\'s innovative product Moby [ph]. The progress we\'re making here is real and we believe there is significant opportunity for this brand globally. With our strategic partnerships with Alibaba and Babytree in China coming online, we are setting the foundation for accelerated growth in the Asia-Pacific market over the next few years, a business model we will look to repeat in other markets around the world. Now, let me briefly touch base on Hot Wheels. At the beginning of 2015, we told you this brand was the sleeper in our portfolio and you could already see we have begun to wake this brand up with annual sales outpacing the industry and growing at an average rate of 8% annually for the past two years. We made some strategic investments in the product, content and digital, focusing on the basics – cars, tracks and playsets. And today, all our tracks and our playsets are able to connect to each other. This year, we are building on this with tracks and vehicles that combine construction play with vehicle action, expanding the depth of fun kids can have with Hot Wheels. All of this allows a child to build out his own world with multiple purchases over time. And we continue to infuse technology into product lines by expanding our very successful remote control and AI platforms with new and innovative product offerings.  So, it’s fair to say we have been making some tangible progress with our key core brands. Now, American Girl and Thomas are work-in-progress, but you’re beginning to see a new brand architecture and content executions coming to life. Moving on, while our licensed entertainment portfolio endured some tough first quarter comps, we anticipate real progress in the second quarter and throughout the year. We are the lead toy licensee on four big box office theatricals – Cars 3, Justice League, Fast and Furious and Wonder Woman. All four target a different audience and toy consumer, giving us the opportunity to expand on multiple toy aisles. And more importantly, from a strategic point of view, these theatrical events are coming out from different, highly successful entertainment companies – Universal, Warner Bros., and Disney – demonstrating a significant improvement in the depth and breadth of our licensed entertainment partnerships. These partnerships, as well as our key relationships with Nickelodeon and WWE, move well beyond 2017, presenting additional opportunities to grow in the future. Let me end my remarks by saying we believe there is significant untapped potential in our core brands and our licensed entertainment partnerships. And while we continue to make real progress, focusing on the basics of investing in the future, Margo and I recognize we must step it up and become relentless around innovation, content, digital and consumer insights. I\'m truly energized to have Margo join our team. Already in the short time she has been with the company, she has made immediate impact on our strategic thinking, our operational execution and our culture. Since we’ve had the benefit of working together previously, we are moving quickly to take action to accelerate growth, improve profitability and create long-term shareholder value. And we’re looking forward to sharing more on this at our upcoming investor day in June. And now, I\'d like to turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Farr  Thank you, Richard. And good afternoon, everyone. My plan for today is to provide a little more insight into the first quarter, but focus mainly on its impact on our full year expectations. But before I go any further, I want to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, I’ll be referring to gross sales in constant currency in order to provide better visibility into the underlying topline trends. And in order to provide more transparency in the fundamentals of the business, I’ll also reference some adjusted financial results that exclude non-recurring executive compensation and severance related to our business transformation. As always, reconciliation to GAAP numbers are provided in our press release and the slide deck. So, let’s walk through the P&L beginning with the top line. Gross sales were down 15% as reported and in constant currency. Going into the quarter, we knew we would be challenged by tough license entertainment comps, continued softness in some of our girls properties, lower licensing income, Easter timing and our retail inventory overhang coming out of the holiday season. What we didn’t expect was the prolonged impact from the retail inventory overhang and the resulting slower pace of reorders by retailers. With sales in North America and Europe particularly impacted, however, we were encouraged by strong performance in Asia-Pacific and continued momentum in Latin America. Moving on to other P&L drivers, our reported gross margin for the first quarter came in significantly lower than expected at 37.9%. During the quarter, gross margin was primarily impacted by an additional obsolescence related to the discontinuation of certain product lines from some of our ancillary brands. Reduced absorption of supply chain fixed costs due to lower sales, an unfavorable currency impact and lower licensing income. These headwinds were partially offset by pricing and our cost savings initiatives. A number of these factors should not carryforward in the remainder of the year, but will impact full year gross margins. As planned, advertising was flat as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter. And we remain disciplined with SG&A as we’ve continued to aggressively reduce costs, while balancing strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A was down approximately $13.1 million or 4% year-over-year for the quarter. The majority of the year-over-year SG&A savings came from our successful efforts to tightly manage our overhead spending. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 22.3%, including discrete items. Finally, adjusted EPS for the first quarter was a loss of $0.32 compared to the prior year loss of $0.14. Now, turning to our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $382 million in cash, $218 million lower than the first quarter of 2016, due to a higher working capital usage and, as expected, our own inventory was up year-over-year partially due to lower Q1 sales and to support our new licensed entertainment launches throughout the year. And the continued positive core key brand POS trends we’re seeing on a global basis tracked internally at wholesale. Overall, we\'re comfortable with our inventory, both owned and at retail, as we enter the second quarter with a later Easter and a June launch of Cars 3. Receivables were also up, primarily due to country and customer mix as well as later sales in the quarter. And we continue to deploy capital in a discipline manner to both manage the business and reward shareholders. As expected, capital expenditures were up as we continue to make investments to grow the business. After reinvesting in the business, dividends remain our first priority. Our Board recently declared the second quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared with the second quarter of 2016.  Now, moving to our full year 2017 outlook, the first quarter results have set us back. And as a result, we now expect to be below the full year financial outlook that we provided in February. We now expect growth to be in the mid-single digits with adjusted operating margin as a percentage of net sales to be flat to full year 2016 due to higher revenues, which are expected to be offset by higher SG&A and slightly lower gross margins. We still expect strong revenue growth to come from incremental licensed entertainment portfolio, including Disney\'s Cars 3, our key core brands, our strategic investments in emerging markets – particularly China and Russia – partially offset by continued declines in Monster High and Ever After High. Looking at our other P&L levers, year-over-year we expect to see sales adjustments roughly flat to last year, a year-over-year decline in gross margins due to the obsolescence expense in the first quarter, continued mix challenges and higher royalty expense due to our upcoming entertainment display. These will partially be offset by strategic pricing and the successful execution of our cost savings initiatives. We expect to achieve our $120 million gross cost savings target for the year. As for advertising, we continue to expect to be on the low end of our historical range of 11% to 13% for the full year. We’re also continuing to tightly manage adjusted SG&A, while balancing our investments in emerging markets and technology. We will continue to focus on our cost savings initiatives, which will be more than offset by higher incentive accruals versus 2016 if we achieve our targeted performance metrics for 2017. Incentive compensation is an important tool for employee retention, which is essential to deliver on the turnaround and position the company well for the medium to long term. As for tax rate assumptions, we still expect a full year tax rate, including discrete items to be 21% for 2017, assuming no changes to existing law. Also, we’ve adopted a new accounting standard last year related to stock-based compensation, which may impact the tax rate going forward. In terms of cash flow in 2017, we still expect significant cash flow generation, topline growth, sustained operating margin and improved inventory management. Our capital deployment framework still targets $800 million of cash at year-end. And while we expect to come in slightly below that target, we still believe we’ll have sufficient flexibility to continue investing in the business and supporting the dividend, which remains a priority going forward. Mattel’s Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the dividend on a quarterly basis, while taking into consideration the development of Margo’s strategic roadmap to support and accelerate the company’s strategic priorities and path to growth. The roadmap will also include capital allocation priorities, to invest in the business to drive future growth and capital deployment including the dividend. We’ll know a lot more on how we are set up for the full year after the second quarter. We’ll have better reads on POS for entertainment properties, including launch of Cars 3, our key core brands, as well as our challenged brands like Monster High. As we think about Q2, we expect high-single digit revenue growth, with one third of the incremental volume expected Cars 3 to support the launch of the theatrical release in June, a sequential improvement in gross margins due to scale versus the first quarter of 2017, but below the gross margin rate in the second quarter of 2016, and adjusted operating income is expected to be slightly better than the second quarter of 2016 due to higher revenues being offset by lower gross margin. Looking beyond 2017, we remain committed to growing the business, expanding margins and rewarding our shareholders. I look forward to continuing these discussions at our upcoming investor day in June.  With that, we’ll now open the call for questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jaime Katz of Morningstar. Your line is open. Jaime Katz Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my calls. Or good afternoon. First, can you tell us sort of if you feel you’re largely complete with the – get working through the inventory overhang or is there some more that we should think about going through the second quarter and potentially even hanging into the third quarter? Margaret Georgiadis Thank you, Jaime, for the question. We do believe that we worked through it. And, Kevin, would you like to share anything else? Kevin Farr Sure. I think – let me just take you through it. I think we originally expected the impact to be 1% or 2% of full year sales. And it turned out to be the impact was closer to 2%. The retail inventory overhang was highly concentrated in North America, as we\'ve already stated. Now, if you look at year-to-date through Easter, POS for key core brands were up mid-single digits, and the retail inventory in North America is down by 3% year-over-year, which is pretty normal for this time. So, while there’s still a few isolated pockets of inventory, the overhang is largely behind us. Jaime Katz And then, can you talk about your longer-term goals? I know you are still holding to the 15% to 20% for operating margins, but does this move the ability to capture that even farther out than maybe we originally anticipated? Margaret Georgiadis We have a lot of work to do to successfully position Mattel for the future, but we do see a clear path to driving sustained top line growth and the operating margins of 15% plus over time. The exact timing will depend on a number of factors that will be addressed by the ongoing strategic review, and we will provide a roadmap of action sets to get there at our investor day in June. Jaime Katz Thank you. I’ll jump back into the queue. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Your line is open. Eric Handler Yes. Thank you for the question. Actually, two things. First, Kevin, just a housecleaning thing. When you talk about operating margin being flat year-over-year, is that versus the 10.3% operating margin last year or I think that 10.3% was negatively impacted by an item, so it was really 11-point-something? And then secondly, for Margo, I guess as you look at this business and the opportunities that you have with technology and some of the creative initiatives that you have, why do you feel it’s so important right now or at least why does the board think it\'s so important right now to maintain the dividend? It doesn\'t seem like investors are really rewarding you to have a 6% dividend yield. It\'s way above what the S&P dividend yield is.  Wouldn’t it be better to preserve cash and maybe increase the investments into some of your new initiatives and try to revive revenue growth by adding to the investment line? Kevin Farr Okay. I’ll start with the first question, Eric. It’s 10.3%. That is correct. That’s the right thing to compare it to. Margaret Georgiadis And, Eric, on your question about the dividend versus investing, we are deeply in the middle of the evaluation of our business and I don\'t want to presuppose any outcomes at this point. The company has had a long-standing capital allocation framework and the board continues to evaluate it every quarter as usual. Ultimately, this is a board level decision and we will follow up when appropriate. Eric Handler Okay, thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next call comes from the line of Arpiné Kocharyan of UBS. Your line is open. Arpiné Kocharyan Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have a couple actually. If you could give a little bit more color on retail sales, a bit more in detail, what exactly was Q1 POS up companywide? And then, obviously, March was a – you had a huge shift in Easter. How much of that – if you excluded out comps, that would be great. If you could share, three weeks into April, what does that number look like year-to-date. And then I have a follow-up. Margaret Georgiadis So, Richard, I know you covered some of that earlier. Why don’t you go back and then we can make sure that we cover all your questions, Arpiné. Richard Dickson Sure. From a POS perspective, and as you know, we track POS at wholesale. It shows Mattel is slightly down as a whole in the quarter, excluding Disney Princess, which is primarily due to a tough license entertainment comp and some toy box brand.  The global POS, both in – actually North America and international on core brands, as I mentioned, Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price, is up single digits, and in some cases, in international up double-digits. Arpiné Kocharyan That is the year-to-date number? Richard Dickson That was through March 30. Arpiné Kocharyan Is there anything you could share on Barbie in term of retail sales in North America and international, what it looks like either through year-to-date or as of Q1? Richard Dickson Yeah. As I mentioned, Barbie sales both in North America and international are up single digits performing as to expectation. And if you recall, actually last year, we had a strong performance as well from a POS perspective in the first quarter. Segments continue to do well, such as Fashionistas, which I mentioned, Dreamtopia, our state segment is doing well. We have some areas of weakness within the Barbie portfolio for this quarter on entertainment, which as we move forward and I explained in my upfront, our content strategy is evolving and we’re pretty excited about what the back half represents in terms of a new form of content, new ways of distributing it. But generally speaking, we’re pleased with the POS progress, both domestic and internationally. Arpiné Kocharyan That’s very helpful. And then, on Disney franchise, I know that there was remaining inventory that you guys shipped in Q1 last year. But I believe that was not material. Is there a way – could you quantify what exactly that was last year that was shipped? There was some remaining inventory that you had some grace period to ship. Richard Dickson Yeah. I think it was de minimis from our shipping perspective. There was quite a bit of consumer takeaway, though, in the first quarter last year. As we shipped in the fourth quarter of 2015, those sold through, a lot of them in 2016 first quarter. Arpiné Kocharyan Okay. Okay, thank you. And then, on the top line guidance, seems like Q1 down double-digit. That implies the rest of the three quarters have to be up at least sort of 9%, 10%. As you stand here today, do you feel like some of the chunkier items you were expecting prior to Q1 still stand? For example, Cars 3, about $300 million. And what do you expect from DC Super Hero Girls? Margaret Georgiadis We continue to feel confident in the worldwide sales for the Cars movie of $300 million. And as we think about the sales guidance, part of the revision is driven by the inventory overhang impact, moving from 1% to 2% of full year sales impact as stated earlier. And part of it is that we are really being very careful this year, striking the right balance between sales and inventory build, given the experience we had last year in Q4. Arpiné Kocharyan Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Markets. Gerrick Johnson Hey, good afternoon. On the inventory obsolescence, how much was written down and what lines and properties were those? Kevin Farr I don’t think we’re going to get into lines and properties, but it was ancillary brands that we discontinued. And besides the obsolescence, when you look at the impact to the quarter, obsolescence probably had the biggest impact on the decline in margins, followed by scale and then forex.  Gerrick Johnson Okay. Can you give us a dollar amount on that? Kevin Farr It was about $6 million. Gerrick Johnson Okay. On Toys "R" Us’ call on Thursday, they said, “we will work down inventory for the remainder of the year.” How does that square with you guys saying that your overhang is behind you guys? Is Toys "R" Us is just overloaded in other products from other companies and how does your position look there? Richard Dickson Yeah. I can’t speak to Toys "R" Us\' comments. I can speak about our business overall and certainly our relationship with Toys "R" Us is very strong. As we’ve said on total, the inventory challenge that we\'ve had going into the quarters is largely behind us. There are pockets of specifically inventory and retailers that we’re working through, but on the whole, nothing significant. POS remains solid and is pretty consistent with what we’ve seen. And as we move forward, again, as Kevin suggested, all the data suggests that the inventory challenges are behind us. Gerrick Johnson Okay. Thank you, Richard. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo. Your question please. Timothy Conder Thank you. Any specific geographies – and again, you said largely have the inventory overhang cleared up, but where would you say that there may be some little pockets remaining to be mopped up? Question one. And then related to cars, just want to make sure we’re on the same level here. So, you\'re still confident – that $300 million incremental, is that above whatever cars did for Mattel in 2016? Just a clarification on that. Kevin Farr Yes. That is correct. And with respect to inventories, we’re pretty well cleaned up in North America. Little bit of pockets and there’s a couple of countries in Europe. Timothy Conder Okay, okay. And then, Kevin and Margo, you both sort of alluded to the – managing the inventory a little bit better. How much of the overhang and discounting that we saw in Q4 and then native to then in Q1 here was due to, let’s just say, more competitive issues versus maybe more internal inventory working capital planning, any issues from an internal perspective? Richard Dickson No. I think as we talked about at the year-end, we set [indiscernible]. We built the inventory and then we needed to ship it in the period of time that consumers are out to buy toys. And so, that’s what’s happening in the first quarter, is the overhang from that. Timothy Conder Okay, okay. And just keeping item here, any tentative date, location there in New York for the planned investor day? Margaret Georgiadis Margaret Georgiadis We’re finalizing the details for that and we want to announce it shortly. Mid-June. Timothy Conder Mid-June. Okay, great. Thank you. Timothy Conder Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Swartz of SunTrust. Your question please. Michael Swartz Hey, good evening, everyone. I just wanted to follow-up on the obsolescence charge in the quarter. Kevin, I think you said it was $6 million impact. Are you now fully reserved? In other words, we shouldn\'t expect any additional costs from that going forward? Kevin Farr Yeah. I think this was a special event where we dropped some product line. And as we look out to the rest of the year, we really don’t – anticipating doing that again. And we think with regards to obsolescence expense overall against our inventories, that’s [indiscernible] stated at the end of March. So, yeah, I think this is one of those one-time items that we don’t expect to see in the balance of the year, along with forex. Michael Swartz Okay. And then second question, I think, Margo, you had mentioned that American Girl lost some of its momentum. And understanding the strategy in the past year, so has been to introduce some new brands into the wholesale channel. I guess how do we think about that business over the next – in the near term and longer-term about how you actually grow and regain some of that momentum? Margaret Georgiadis So, first of all, American Girl maintains an incredibly passionate groups of users and so we are very excited about this brand and its potential, not just in the US, but internationally as well. Specifically, what I was referring to is the ability for us to grow this franchise as you can see from our numbers, both last year and in the first quarter of this year. We are not yet meeting the kind of growth expectations that we would love to have for this franchise. And therefore, we are deeply looking at our product line strategy, how we’re building our relationships with our customers. We have a new team there that started not too long ago and they have a lot of great plans for the brand. But we did want to fully disclose and in the spirit of transparency that we still believe that’s a work-in-progress. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. And as always, appreciate your comments and color on the quarter. Big picture question here, because listening to everything so far on this call and especially in the prepared remarks, I’m just having a problem seeing the forest for the trees. So, Richard, to go back to something that you said, at the end of your prepared remarks, you said that you must step it up. And I\'m just trying to understand what that means since we\'ve all had the impression that you’ve been stepping it up pretty aggressively over the past two years. And, Kevin, we seem to be getting into a trend here where management talks about results that you didn\'t see coming. So, for those of us who want to be more open-minded that Mattel can get back on track, how do we have confidence that the company is in the right place to execute the roadmap that Margo laid out? And, Margo, you said you\'re confident that you can deliver on aggressive expectations. How much needs to change at Mattel for you to achieve those expectations? Richard Dickson So, I\'ll take a stab at going first on this one. So, as I mentioned in my conclusion and that you’re picking up, this is a business about momentum and about sort of the long view as it relates to product development and our process. At the same time, we’re living in a digitally savvy world where our consumer is able to digest information at the speed of lightning here. We obviously need to continue to stress innovation as part of the heritage of the company, but in a more pronounced and aggressive way, the way we build product, the way we think about approaching our consumer, new waves of engagement, content is essentially the absolute ingredient, if you will, to narrate to consumers how our product is connected. So, we’re working tirelessly to develop new and interesting ways to tell new stories with our brands. And consumer insights, while we are incredibly pronounced and skilled in it, you can never essentially rest on it. We constantly have to listen to our consumers, react very quickly to trends. And so, I don\'t necessarily think that this is anything that we haven\'t done. However, I do believe that with the learnings that we have and the momentum that we now see, we can get even more pronounced. We spent a lot of time in the beginning, if you will, sorting through and listening to our consumers and trying to essentially put back together these core brands and reignite our relationships in the entertainment community. I think what we’ve displayed is we\'ve done a good job of that and we’re starting to see scores on the board. Now that we do have a little bit momentum, it\'s really time to step it up and start to dial up what we’re learning, stop some things that aren’t working. And with Margo\'s introduction here and ability to help us from a strategic, cultural and operational perspective, cut through some stuff, we’re going to make a lot more progress. Kevin Farr I’ll just say, it is pretty challenging to predict a business that’s so seasonal. I think as you look at our outlook for today that we’ve updated, as Margo indicated, we have a desire to be more disciplined in our sales projections, ensure that we don’t overbuild inventory, given our experience next year. So, I think we have a high level of confidence in the outlook that we’re giving you today. Margaret Georgiadis And in the spirit of trying not to be redundant, I am in complete alignment with what Kevin and Richard were saying. As I’m coming in new, this is really a great company, but we’ve had a couple of resets, particularly in our doll portfolio. And that has really forced us to accomplish some good things, which is we’ve reinvigorated our focus on our core brands and all the work that Richard has started over the last couple of years is beginning to move us in the right direction. But Richard and I are both extremely aligned on the opportunity to truly step on the gas. We have the right positions for these brands. So, the opportunity is to take a little bit more risk to transform them faster is what’s going to enable us to move into that future that we want to see.  We have all the element in place today. But we do need to challenge ourselves from a cultural perspective. We need to modernize our infrastructure. We need to lean harder on the things that we know have always made this company incredible – innovation, collaboration and now we have to add to that speed. Because when we add those things together, as we talked about exploring the wonder of childhood with our users, we also need to do that with ourselves. We have to really ask the tough questions and make the tough decisions. When we think about the consumer insights and data, the consumer is really moving quickly. This is a very long cycle business. And so, we have to begin to challenge the way we think about designing, developing and launching our products. And today, we are still doing it very much the same way we did many years ago. And so, we’re really beginning to challenge ourselves. As Richard said, to think differently about what is really right for the consumer, what do they really want from us, how do we engage them in a much deeper conversation than how retail often has historically just driven just the two launch periods. And retail has actually decided to work with us on that as well because they are trying to get closer to the consumer. So, those efforts are very aligned. In addition to transforming our brands and our product, we also have the opportunity to leverage technology across our business. As Kevin referred to, this is a very complicated business. 60% of our products are new every year. And being able to use data to really understand consumer demand and to predict that more accurately going into the back half of the year is very important and I think we can do a better job of how we do that, both by right-sizing our sales expectations as we come through this transition, but also as we use next-generation indicators of demand. Felicia Hendrix So, Margo, just from your vast experience that you\'ve had, how long does it take to change a culture to adapt to current trends? Margaret Georgiadis No, I come from the world where leadership starts from the top. And Richard and I have worked very hard in combining our management teams together and really setting a very proactive approach to how we want to work differently together. And we’re already seeing great response from the team. I think one of the most important reasons that we’re right-sizing the guidance, given what the overhang that’s come before us in Q1 is that we want to set this business up to last for the long term. We want to do it right this year and we want to be set up for the future. So, we’re continuing to invest aggressively in our business in Asia where we see the growth opportunity as well as in our new brand opportunities. And I think if we put too much pressure on the sales lever right now, we run the risk of running into some of the same challenges we did last year. So, that’s what we really want this year, to be the one where we write it and really run. And that’s why we feel excited to come spend time with the investors in June, to share with you the excitement we have about the future of this company, both sales and profitability. And we think you\'ll be very excited about what we have to share. Felicia Hendrix I definitely look forward to that. Thank you for all of that. And just – Kevin, if you could help us understand, on the balance sheet, accounts receivable increased 8% year-over-year. Your sales are down 15%. So, can you help reconcile that? Kevin Farr Yeah. I think that’s a factor of country risk – or country mix and also customer mix in different markets as well as we saw later sales in the quarter. Those are the three drivers in the increased in accounts receivable. Felicia Hendrix So, when you say country mix, do you mean shipping more, say, internationally? Kevin Farr Yeah. Selling more in Russia, China where the trade terms are different and longer. Felicia Hendrix And so, was the bigger driver that versus the timing? Kevin Farr Yeah. Those two would be bigger than the timing. The timing was part of it. Felicia Hendrix Okay. All right. Thank you.  Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser of B. Riley. Your line is open. Linda Bolton-Weiser Hi. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the mix effect on your margin projection for the full year? That’s a very important factor. And I guess, with Monster High now being managed as part of toy box, is that something that will imply maybe a greater – like an acceleration of decline, like it may kind of decline faster? And if so, can you girls portfolio be up this year? And can you get your margin target even if the girls portfolio does not grow this year? So, the mix factor is a big important part of it. So, can you just comment on that and sort of the continuing decline of Monster High? Margaret Georgiadis So, let me start. And then Kevin or Richard, feel free to jump in. There is no question that the decline of Monster High has been a really challenge for us the last couple of years. We just want to be very transparent about that. At the same time, we\'ve made a lot of progress with both Barbie and expanding Barbie, as Richard shared several of those important examples earlier. And we\'ve also launched new doll properties in the toy box with a lot of success, working with Warner Bros. and WWE. And those are both very successful franchises. We are continuing to look at ways in which we can reinvigorate the Monster High business because it has a really deep and passionate following the consumers. But it’s often very challenging in these cyclical brands. When they start going in those wrong directions, you have to be able to invest and reposition them. And so, one of the reasons, they went into the toy box – because that\'s really what the toy box is about. The toy box is about creating new brands, reinvigorating brands. It’s all about partnerships. And so, we felt that it was important to have it in a place where it would get the right management attention versus our core brands. Those are evergreen brands that have very persistent sales year upon year, have a much more expansive range of categories that they participate in and experiences. And therefore, the approach that we take to managing them is different than a more content driven franchise, which is really what Monster High was for us, is what catapulted it to success in the beginning. It became a viral success overnight. And then, we just weren’t able to find that right [indiscernible] to tap in to where we wanted to be. I don’t know, Richard, if you want to add anything. ROETTGEN: No, I think that really says it all. Just to sort of fill in a little bit of a blank, it still is a very powerful brand for us. Girls, as mentioned, are still attracted to the brand. We are coming out with additional new content on YouTube, new series launching in August, and we continue to evolve and align advertising and promotional spending accordingly. There are a lot of things working both in content and in product and again trying to maximize the things that are working for us, and work harder and essentially eliminate the things that aren’t. Kevin Farr Let me just follow-up on gross margin for the quarter. It was down due to a number of factors, including additional obsolescence expense as we talked about, a reduced supply chain fixed cost absorption due to lower sales, low licensing revenue and forex, as well as a few other factors. That explains about 75% of the 680 basis point decline.  When you look at mix, the impact of mix was slightly negative versus the prior year. And it really is related to our doll portfolio declines. Linda Bolton-Weiser Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian of Citi. Your line is open. Greg Badishkanian Yes. Thank you. Just on American Girl, the momentum – you talked about not having that momentum. Is that at the company-owned stores or is that the third-party retailers that you’re using? Is that where maybe the momentum isn’t where you’d like it to be? And when you talk about momentum, is that versus the fourth quarter trend or just generally where you’d like that brand to be in terms of sales growth at retail? Richard Dickson Greg, it’s Richard. So, as you know, the first quarter is historically a very small quarter for American Girl. And the decline in the brand, as mentioned, was partially due to timing. We have a new phase rollout of new contemporary. Tenney and Logan specifically were rolled out in the first quarter and we’ve got a new character coming out. Her name is Z. In the second quarter, there was some frankly mixes in the business with our girl of the year this year versus last year. All of this was an expected decline. The impact actually of the decline was partially offset by WellieWishers and expanded distribution. So, there is a story within the story itself. But ultimately, I think the takeaway here is that there is work to do. We are applying some of those strategies in place. We’re excited about the contemporary doll rollout. It’s doing very nicely for us. And so, we’re going to be rolling out some new content with Amazon, starting in June actually. We have a new story coming out, American Girl story about summer camp. We’ve got some great initiatives also on YouTube, digital content. And we’ll continue to take some good swings at revitalizing the American Girl franchise. Greg Badishkanian And then, just finally, earlier you mentioned improving your e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities. So just, how should we think about the incremental levels of spend and how quickly you can see a sales benefit from those initiatives? Richard Dickson So, e-commerce is, obviously, a huge growth engine for us. We continue to perform – in fact, outperform the industry as it relates to e-com. The fastest-growing distribution channel at Mattel. We were the number one toy manufacturer online coming out of the holiday. We continue to partner both with our bricks and mortar partners that have become arms as well as pure plays online. Mentioned Alibaba and Babytree as one. But we’re really building on these omni-channel partnerships to not only offer the best shopping experience, but also great product as well. We’re going to continue to invest in the space, both in capabilities as well as CRM and our salesforce partnerships. So, it is an expanding channel for us. We think that we\'re actually leading in the industry and we will continue to think about it as a digital first opportunity. Greg Badishkanian Great, thank you. David Zbojniewicz Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator Yes, sir. Our question comes from the line of Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Ng Thanks very much. I have one for Margo and one for Kevin. Margo, in the discussion about the dividend, I think it was mentioned that the board would take into consideration your strategic roadmap. Was that alluding to potential investment to set up Mattel for sustainable long-term growth? So, the question is, now that you’ve been on the job for a couple of months, where you do see some of the performance gaps in areas where some investments could potentially yield some high returns? And for Kevin, I think at Toy Fair, you mentioned that you\'re expecting strong growth for Fisher-Price in 2017. Is that still the case? And any color you can give around the strength of Wheels will be helpful as well? Margaret Georgiadis Let me start with your first question, Michael. Thank you.  So, as I shared earlier, as we go through the in-depth evaluation of the business and how we want to invest to grow the business going forward, as I shared back in February, I still believe we have significant financial flexibility within our existing envelope to fund our growth initiatives. At the same time, we will evaluate all opportunities for growth and how we make those trade-offs. And the company wants to ensure that we are constantly balancing our capital allocation framework that we’ve always had with those opportunities for growth. And we will be sharing that with the board as well as following up with the investments community in June. Richard Dickson It’s Richard. Just to expand a little bit on your question related to Hot Wheels, it is, as I mentioned in my upfront, one of our exciting core brands that continues to deliver outpacing the industry. We have lots of great new promotions, product and content that we continue to roll out. The strong momentum on YouTube particularly, as subscribers have grown double-digit even on the quarter, we’re on track to hit some significant expectations. We’re looking at all sorts of ways of expanding the brand, which we’re looking forward to sharing more of that in June. And I would complement the same type of profile with Fisher-Price. As we continue to get more pronounced in child development, we’re really developing an incredible curriculum with talent in our organization around development – cognitive, social, emotional, physical development with product line architectures that support it and a communication system with moms and dads around the world, leveraging, obviously, a digital first approach to it. So, lots of great ingredients that ultimately, we’ll share with you more in June.  Margaret Georgiadis I think just to specifically answer your question, I think we’re expecting Fisher-Price to have solid growth this year. Michael Ng Okay, thank you very much.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jaime Katz of Morningstar. Your line is open. Jaime Katz Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my calls. Or good afternoon. First, can you tell us sort of if you feel you’re largely complete with the – get working through the inventory overhang or is there some more that we should think about going through the second quarter and potentially even hanging into the third quarter? Margaret Georgiadis Thank you, Jaime, for the question. We do believe that we worked through it. And, Kevin, would you like to share anything else? Kevin Farr Sure. I think – let me just take you through it. I think we originally expected the impact to be 1% or 2% of full year sales. And it turned out to be the impact was closer to 2%. The retail inventory overhang was highly concentrated in North America, as we\'ve already stated. Now, if you look at year-to-date through Easter, POS for key core brands were up mid-single digits, and the retail inventory in North America is down by 3% year-over-year, which is pretty normal for this time. So, while there’s still a few isolated pockets of inventory, the overhang is largely behind us. Jaime Katz And then, can you talk about your longer-term goals? I know you are still holding to the 15% to 20% for operating margins, but does this move the ability to capture that even farther out than maybe we originally anticipated? Margaret Georgiadis We have a lot of work to do to successfully position Mattel for the future, but we do see a clear path to driving sustained top line growth and the operating margins of 15% plus over time. The exact timing will depend on a number of factors that will be addressed by the ongoing strategic review, and we will provide a roadmap of action sets to get there at our investor day in June. Jaime Katz Thank you. I’ll jump back into the queue. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Your line is open. Eric Handler Yes. Thank you for the question. Actually, two things. First, Kevin, just a housecleaning thing. When you talk about operating margin being flat year-over-year, is that versus the 10.3% operating margin last year or I think that 10.3% was negatively impacted by an item, so it was really 11-point-something? And then secondly, for Margo, I guess as you look at this business and the opportunities that you have with technology and some of the creative initiatives that you have, why do you feel it’s so important right now or at least why does the board think it\'s so important right now to maintain the dividend? It doesn\'t seem like investors are really rewarding you to have a 6% dividend yield. It\'s way above what the S&P dividend yield is.  Wouldn’t it be better to preserve cash and maybe increase the investments into some of your new initiatives and try to revive revenue growth by adding to the investment line? Kevin Farr Okay. I’ll start with the first question, Eric. It’s 10.3%. That is correct. That’s the right thing to compare it to. Margaret Georgiadis And, Eric, on your question about the dividend versus investing, we are deeply in the middle of the evaluation of our business and I don\'t want to presuppose any outcomes at this point. The company has had a long-standing capital allocation framework and the board continues to evaluate it every quarter as usual. Ultimately, this is a board level decision and we will follow up when appropriate. Eric Handler Okay, thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next call comes from the line of Arpiné Kocharyan of UBS. Your line is open. Arpiné Kocharyan Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have a couple actually. If you could give a little bit more color on retail sales, a bit more in detail, what exactly was Q1 POS up companywide? And then, obviously, March was a – you had a huge shift in Easter. How much of that – if you excluded out comps, that would be great. If you could share, three weeks into April, what does that number look like year-to-date. And then I have a follow-up. Margaret Georgiadis So, Richard, I know you covered some of that earlier. Why don’t you go back and then we can make sure that we cover all your questions, Arpiné. Richard Dickson Sure. From a POS perspective, and as you know, we track POS at wholesale. It shows Mattel is slightly down as a whole in the quarter, excluding Disney Princess, which is primarily due to a tough license entertainment comp and some toy box brand.  The global POS, both in – actually North America and international on core brands, as I mentioned, Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price, is up single digits, and in some cases, in international up double-digits. Arpiné Kocharyan That is the year-to-date number? Richard Dickson That was through March 30. Arpiné Kocharyan Is there anything you could share on Barbie in term of retail sales in North America and international, what it looks like either through year-to-date or as of Q1? Richard Dickson Yeah. As I mentioned, Barbie sales both in North America and international are up single digits performing as to expectation. And if you recall, actually last year, we had a strong performance as well from a POS perspective in the first quarter. Segments continue to do well, such as Fashionistas, which I mentioned, Dreamtopia, our state segment is doing well. We have some areas of weakness within the Barbie portfolio for this quarter on entertainment, which as we move forward and I explained in my upfront, our content strategy is evolving and we’re pretty excited about what the back half represents in terms of a new form of content, new ways of distributing it. But generally speaking, we’re pleased with the POS progress, both domestic and internationally. Arpiné Kocharyan That’s very helpful. And then, on Disney franchise, I know that there was remaining inventory that you guys shipped in Q1 last year. But I believe that was not material. Is there a way – could you quantify what exactly that was last year that was shipped? There was some remaining inventory that you had some grace period to ship. Richard Dickson Yeah. I think it was de minimis from our shipping perspective. There was quite a bit of consumer takeaway, though, in the first quarter last year. As we shipped in the fourth quarter of 2015, those sold through, a lot of them in 2016 first quarter. Arpiné Kocharyan Okay. Okay, thank you. And then, on the top line guidance, seems like Q1 down double-digit. That implies the rest of the three quarters have to be up at least sort of 9%, 10%. As you stand here today, do you feel like some of the chunkier items you were expecting prior to Q1 still stand? For example, Cars 3, about $300 million. And what do you expect from DC Super Hero Girls? Margaret Georgiadis We continue to feel confident in the worldwide sales for the Cars movie of $300 million. And as we think about the sales guidance, part of the revision is driven by the inventory overhang impact, moving from 1% to 2% of full year sales impact as stated earlier. And part of it is that we are really being very careful this year, striking the right balance between sales and inventory build, given the experience we had last year in Q4. Arpiné Kocharyan Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Markets. Gerrick Johnson Hey, good afternoon. On the inventory obsolescence, how much was written down and what lines and properties were those? Kevin Farr I don’t think we’re going to get into lines and properties, but it was ancillary brands that we discontinued. And besides the obsolescence, when you look at the impact to the quarter, obsolescence probably had the biggest impact on the decline in margins, followed by scale and then forex.  Gerrick Johnson Okay. Can you give us a dollar amount on that? Kevin Farr It was about $6 million. Gerrick Johnson Okay. On Toys "R" Us’ call on Thursday, they said, “we will work down inventory for the remainder of the year.” How does that square with you guys saying that your overhang is behind you guys? Is Toys "R" Us is just overloaded in other products from other companies and how does your position look there? Richard Dickson Yeah. I can’t speak to Toys "R" Us\' comments. I can speak about our business overall and certainly our relationship with Toys "R" Us is very strong. As we’ve said on total, the inventory challenge that we\'ve had going into the quarters is largely behind us. There are pockets of specifically inventory and retailers that we’re working through, but on the whole, nothing significant. POS remains solid and is pretty consistent with what we’ve seen. And as we move forward, again, as Kevin suggested, all the data suggests that the inventory challenges are behind us. Gerrick Johnson Okay. Thank you, Richard. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo. Your question please. Timothy Conder Thank you. Any specific geographies – and again, you said largely have the inventory overhang cleared up, but where would you say that there may be some little pockets remaining to be mopped up? Question one. And then related to cars, just want to make sure we’re on the same level here. So, you\'re still confident – that $300 million incremental, is that above whatever cars did for Mattel in 2016? Just a clarification on that. Kevin Farr Yes. That is correct. And with respect to inventories, we’re pretty well cleaned up in North America. Little bit of pockets and there’s a couple of countries in Europe. Timothy Conder Okay, okay. And then, Kevin and Margo, you both sort of alluded to the – managing the inventory a little bit better. How much of the overhang and discounting that we saw in Q4 and then native to then in Q1 here was due to, let’s just say, more competitive issues versus maybe more internal inventory working capital planning, any issues from an internal perspective? Richard Dickson No. I think as we talked about at the year-end, we set [indiscernible]. We built the inventory and then we needed to ship it in the period of time that consumers are out to buy toys. And so, that’s what’s happening in the first quarter, is the overhang from that. Timothy Conder Okay, okay. And just keeping item here, any tentative date, location there in New York for the planned investor day? Margaret Georgiadis Margaret Georgiadis We’re finalizing the details for that and we want to announce it shortly. Mid-June. Timothy Conder Mid-June. Okay, great. Thank you. Timothy Conder Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Swartz of SunTrust. Your question please. Michael Swartz Hey, good evening, everyone. I just wanted to follow-up on the obsolescence charge in the quarter. Kevin, I think you said it was $6 million impact. Are you now fully reserved? In other words, we shouldn\'t expect any additional costs from that going forward? Kevin Farr Yeah. I think this was a special event where we dropped some product line. And as we look out to the rest of the year, we really don’t – anticipating doing that again. And we think with regards to obsolescence expense overall against our inventories, that’s [indiscernible] stated at the end of March. So, yeah, I think this is one of those one-time items that we don’t expect to see in the balance of the year, along with forex. Michael Swartz Okay. And then second question, I think, Margo, you had mentioned that American Girl lost some of its momentum. And understanding the strategy in the past year, so has been to introduce some new brands into the wholesale channel. I guess how do we think about that business over the next – in the near term and longer-term about how you actually grow and regain some of that momentum? Margaret Georgiadis So, first of all, American Girl maintains an incredibly passionate groups of users and so we are very excited about this brand and its potential, not just in the US, but internationally as well. Specifically, what I was referring to is the ability for us to grow this franchise as you can see from our numbers, both last year and in the first quarter of this year. We are not yet meeting the kind of growth expectations that we would love to have for this franchise. And therefore, we are deeply looking at our product line strategy, how we’re building our relationships with our customers. We have a new team there that started not too long ago and they have a lot of great plans for the brand. But we did want to fully disclose and in the spirit of transparency that we still believe that’s a work-in-progress. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. And as always, appreciate your comments and color on the quarter. Big picture question here, because listening to everything so far on this call and especially in the prepared remarks, I’m just having a problem seeing the forest for the trees. So, Richard, to go back to something that you said, at the end of your prepared remarks, you said that you must step it up. And I\'m just trying to understand what that means since we\'ve all had the impression that you’ve been stepping it up pretty aggressively over the past two years. And, Kevin, we seem to be getting into a trend here where management talks about results that you didn\'t see coming. So, for those of us who want to be more open-minded that Mattel can get back on track, how do we have confidence that the company is in the right place to execute the roadmap that Margo laid out? And, Margo, you said you\'re confident that you can deliver on aggressive expectations. How much needs to change at Mattel for you to achieve those expectations? Richard Dickson So, I\'ll take a stab at going first on this one. So, as I mentioned in my conclusion and that you’re picking up, this is a business about momentum and about sort of the long view as it relates to product development and our process. At the same time, we’re living in a digitally savvy world where our consumer is able to digest information at the speed of lightning here. We obviously need to continue to stress innovation as part of the heritage of the company, but in a more pronounced and aggressive way, the way we build product, the way we think about approaching our consumer, new waves of engagement, content is essentially the absolute ingredient, if you will, to narrate to consumers how our product is connected. So, we’re working tirelessly to develop new and interesting ways to tell new stories with our brands. And consumer insights, while we are incredibly pronounced and skilled in it, you can never essentially rest on it. We constantly have to listen to our consumers, react very quickly to trends. And so, I don\'t necessarily think that this is anything that we haven\'t done. However, I do believe that with the learnings that we have and the momentum that we now see, we can get even more pronounced. We spent a lot of time in the beginning, if you will, sorting through and listening to our consumers and trying to essentially put back together these core brands and reignite our relationships in the entertainment community. I think what we’ve displayed is we\'ve done a good job of that and we’re starting to see scores on the board. Now that we do have a little bit momentum, it\'s really time to step it up and start to dial up what we’re learning, stop some things that aren’t working. And with Margo\'s introduction here and ability to help us from a strategic, cultural and operational perspective, cut through some stuff, we’re going to make a lot more progress. Kevin Farr I’ll just say, it is pretty challenging to predict a business that’s so seasonal. I think as you look at our outlook for today that we’ve updated, as Margo indicated, we have a desire to be more disciplined in our sales projections, ensure that we don’t overbuild inventory, given our experience next year. So, I think we have a high level of confidence in the outlook that we’re giving you today. Margaret Georgiadis And in the spirit of trying not to be redundant, I am in complete alignment with what Kevin and Richard were saying. As I’m coming in new, this is really a great company, but we’ve had a couple of resets, particularly in our doll portfolio. And that has really forced us to accomplish some good things, which is we’ve reinvigorated our focus on our core brands and all the work that Richard has started over the last couple of years is beginning to move us in the right direction. But Richard and I are both extremely aligned on the opportunity to truly step on the gas. We have the right positions for these brands. So, the opportunity is to take a little bit more risk to transform them faster is what’s going to enable us to move into that future that we want to see.  We have all the element in place today. But we do need to challenge ourselves from a cultural perspective. We need to modernize our infrastructure. We need to lean harder on the things that we know have always made this company incredible – innovation, collaboration and now we have to add to that speed. Because when we add those things together, as we talked about exploring the wonder of childhood with our users, we also need to do that with ourselves. We have to really ask the tough questions and make the tough decisions. When we think about the consumer insights and data, the consumer is really moving quickly. This is a very long cycle business. And so, we have to begin to challenge the way we think about designing, developing and launching our products. And today, we are still doing it very much the same way we did many years ago. And so, we’re really beginning to challenge ourselves. As Richard said, to think differently about what is really right for the consumer, what do they really want from us, how do we engage them in a much deeper conversation than how retail often has historically just driven just the two launch periods. And retail has actually decided to work with us on that as well because they are trying to get closer to the consumer. So, those efforts are very aligned. In addition to transforming our brands and our product, we also have the opportunity to leverage technology across our business. As Kevin referred to, this is a very complicated business. 60% of our products are new every year. And being able to use data to really understand consumer demand and to predict that more accurately going into the back half of the year is very important and I think we can do a better job of how we do that, both by right-sizing our sales expectations as we come through this transition, but also as we use next-generation indicators of demand. Felicia Hendrix So, Margo, just from your vast experience that you\'ve had, how long does it take to change a culture to adapt to current trends? Margaret Georgiadis No, I come from the world where leadership starts from the top. And Richard and I have worked very hard in combining our management teams together and really setting a very proactive approach to how we want to work differently together. And we’re already seeing great response from the team. I think one of the most important reasons that we’re right-sizing the guidance, given what the overhang that’s come before us in Q1 is that we want to set this business up to last for the long term. We want to do it right this year and we want to be set up for the future. So, we’re continuing to invest aggressively in our business in Asia where we see the growth opportunity as well as in our new brand opportunities. And I think if we put too much pressure on the sales lever right now, we run the risk of running into some of the same challenges we did last year. So, that’s what we really want this year, to be the one where we write it and really run. And that’s why we feel excited to come spend time with the investors in June, to share with you the excitement we have about the future of this company, both sales and profitability. And we think you\'ll be very excited about what we have to share. Felicia Hendrix I definitely look forward to that. Thank you for all of that. And just – Kevin, if you could help us understand, on the balance sheet, accounts receivable increased 8% year-over-year. Your sales are down 15%. So, can you help reconcile that? Kevin Farr Yeah. I think that’s a factor of country risk – or country mix and also customer mix in different markets as well as we saw later sales in the quarter. Those are the three drivers in the increased in accounts receivable. Felicia Hendrix So, when you say country mix, do you mean shipping more, say, internationally? Kevin Farr Yeah. Selling more in Russia, China where the trade terms are different and longer. Felicia Hendrix And so, was the bigger driver that versus the timing? Kevin Farr Yeah. Those two would be bigger than the timing. The timing was part of it. Felicia Hendrix Okay. All right. Thank you.  Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser of B. Riley. Your line is open. Linda Bolton-Weiser Hi. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the mix effect on your margin projection for the full year? That’s a very important factor. And I guess, with Monster High now being managed as part of toy box, is that something that will imply maybe a greater – like an acceleration of decline, like it may kind of decline faster? And if so, can you girls portfolio be up this year? And can you get your margin target even if the girls portfolio does not grow this year? So, the mix factor is a big important part of it. So, can you just comment on that and sort of the continuing decline of Monster High? Margaret Georgiadis So, let me start. And then Kevin or Richard, feel free to jump in. There is no question that the decline of Monster High has been a really challenge for us the last couple of years. We just want to be very transparent about that. At the same time, we\'ve made a lot of progress with both Barbie and expanding Barbie, as Richard shared several of those important examples earlier. And we\'ve also launched new doll properties in the toy box with a lot of success, working with Warner Bros. and WWE. And those are both very successful franchises. We are continuing to look at ways in which we can reinvigorate the Monster High business because it has a really deep and passionate following the consumers. But it’s often very challenging in these cyclical brands. When they start going in those wrong directions, you have to be able to invest and reposition them. And so, one of the reasons, they went into the toy box – because that\'s really what the toy box is about. The toy box is about creating new brands, reinvigorating brands. It’s all about partnerships. And so, we felt that it was important to have it in a place where it would get the right management attention versus our core brands. Those are evergreen brands that have very persistent sales year upon year, have a much more expansive range of categories that they participate in and experiences. And therefore, the approach that we take to managing them is different than a more content driven franchise, which is really what Monster High was for us, is what catapulted it to success in the beginning. It became a viral success overnight. And then, we just weren’t able to find that right [indiscernible] to tap in to where we wanted to be. I don’t know, Richard, if you want to add anything. ROETTGEN: No, I think that really says it all. Just to sort of fill in a little bit of a blank, it still is a very powerful brand for us. Girls, as mentioned, are still attracted to the brand. We are coming out with additional new content on YouTube, new series launching in August, and we continue to evolve and align advertising and promotional spending accordingly. There are a lot of things working both in content and in product and again trying to maximize the things that are working for us, and work harder and essentially eliminate the things that aren’t. Kevin Farr Let me just follow-up on gross margin for the quarter. It was down due to a number of factors, including additional obsolescence expense as we talked about, a reduced supply chain fixed cost absorption due to lower sales, low licensing revenue and forex, as well as a few other factors. That explains about 75% of the 680 basis point decline.  When you look at mix, the impact of mix was slightly negative versus the prior year. And it really is related to our doll portfolio declines. Linda Bolton-Weiser Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian of Citi. Your line is open. Greg Badishkanian Yes. Thank you. Just on American Girl, the momentum – you talked about not having that momentum. Is that at the company-owned stores or is that the third-party retailers that you’re using? Is that where maybe the momentum isn’t where you’d like it to be? And when you talk about momentum, is that versus the fourth quarter trend or just generally where you’d like that brand to be in terms of sales growth at retail? Richard Dickson Greg, it’s Richard. So, as you know, the first quarter is historically a very small quarter for American Girl. And the decline in the brand, as mentioned, was partially due to timing. We have a new phase rollout of new contemporary. Tenney and Logan specifically were rolled out in the first quarter and we’ve got a new character coming out. Her name is Z. In the second quarter, there was some frankly mixes in the business with our girl of the year this year versus last year. All of this was an expected decline. The impact actually of the decline was partially offset by WellieWishers and expanded distribution. So, there is a story within the story itself. But ultimately, I think the takeaway here is that there is work to do. We are applying some of those strategies in place. We’re excited about the contemporary doll rollout. It’s doing very nicely for us. And so, we’re going to be rolling out some new content with Amazon, starting in June actually. We have a new story coming out, American Girl story about summer camp. We’ve got some great initiatives also on YouTube, digital content. And we’ll continue to take some good swings at revitalizing the American Girl franchise. Greg Badishkanian And then, just finally, earlier you mentioned improving your e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities. So just, how should we think about the incremental levels of spend and how quickly you can see a sales benefit from those initiatives? Richard Dickson So, e-commerce is, obviously, a huge growth engine for us. We continue to perform – in fact, outperform the industry as it relates to e-com. The fastest-growing distribution channel at Mattel. We were the number one toy manufacturer online coming out of the holiday. We continue to partner both with our bricks and mortar partners that have become arms as well as pure plays online. Mentioned Alibaba and Babytree as one. But we’re really building on these omni-channel partnerships to not only offer the best shopping experience, but also great product as well. We’re going to continue to invest in the space, both in capabilities as well as CRM and our salesforce partnerships. So, it is an expanding channel for us. We think that we\'re actually leading in the industry and we will continue to think about it as a digital first opportunity. Greg Badishkanian Great, thank you. David Zbojniewicz Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator Yes, sir. Our question comes from the line of Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Ng Thanks very much. I have one for Margo and one for Kevin. Margo, in the discussion about the dividend, I think it was mentioned that the board would take into consideration your strategic roadmap. Was that alluding to potential investment to set up Mattel for sustainable long-term growth? So, the question is, now that you’ve been on the job for a couple of months, where you do see some of the performance gaps in areas where some investments could potentially yield some high returns? And for Kevin, I think at Toy Fair, you mentioned that you\'re expecting strong growth for Fisher-Price in 2017. Is that still the case? And any color you can give around the strength of Wheels will be helpful as well? Margaret Georgiadis Let me start with your first question, Michael. Thank you.  So, as I shared earlier, as we go through the in-depth evaluation of the business and how we want to invest to grow the business going forward, as I shared back in February, I still believe we have significant financial flexibility within our existing envelope to fund our growth initiatives. At the same time, we will evaluate all opportunities for growth and how we make those trade-offs. And the company wants to ensure that we are constantly balancing our capital allocation framework that we’ve always had with those opportunities for growth. And we will be sharing that with the board as well as following up with the investments community in June. Richard Dickson It’s Richard. Just to expand a little bit on your question related to Hot Wheels, it is, as I mentioned in my upfront, one of our exciting core brands that continues to deliver outpacing the industry. We have lots of great new promotions, product and content that we continue to roll out. The strong momentum on YouTube particularly, as subscribers have grown double-digit even on the quarter, we’re on track to hit some significant expectations. We’re looking at all sorts of ways of expanding the brand, which we’re looking forward to sharing more of that in June. And I would complement the same type of profile with Fisher-Price. As we continue to get more pronounced in child development, we’re really developing an incredible curriculum with talent in our organization around development – cognitive, social, emotional, physical development with product line architectures that support it and a communication system with moms and dads around the world, leveraging, obviously, a digital first approach to it. So, lots of great ingredients that ultimately, we’ll share with you more in June.  Margaret Georgiadis I think just to specifically answer your question, I think we’re expecting Fisher-Price to have solid growth this year. Michael Ng Okay, thank you very much.

LLC Liz Pate - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Operator Please stand by, we're about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip Technology Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir. J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc. Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC, that identify important Risk Factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2017 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website, at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of share-based compensation and our acquisition activity. Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record $902.7 million, near the high end of our guidance and up 2.4% sequentially from net sales of $881.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 59.24% for the March quarter and significantly above the mid-point of our guidance, which was 58.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 23.66% of sales, significantly below the mid-point of our guidance range of 24.5%. And non-GAAP operating income was an outstanding 35.6%, well above the mid-point of our guidance of 33.7%, and very close to reaching our prior long-term operating model goal of 36%, which we had just established this past quarter. Non-GAAP net income was a record $276.9 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $1.16, which was $0.10 higher than the mid-point of our guidance of $1.06, up 12.6% on a sequential basis and up 64.7% as compared to the same quarter last year. For fiscal 2017, on a non-GAAP basis net sales were a record $3.502 billion and up 58.2% year-over-year. Gross margins were 57.6%, operating expenses were 25.9% of sales and operating income was 31.6% of sales. Net income was $937.1 million and non-GAAP EPS was a record $3.99 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, net sales in the March 2017 quarter were $902.7 million, GAAP gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 59% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.2 million of share-based compensation and a benefit of $1.4 million from a settlement with a vendor associated with a fab excursion in a previous year. Total operating expenses were $378.7 million and include acquisition and tangible amortization of $94.3 million, share-based compensation of $18.8 million, $6 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and special charges of $46.1 million, consisting primarily of charges associated with our acquisition integration activities, including a $33 million charge associated with the lease facility in San Jose which we inherited in the Atmel acquisition. We have vacated the San Jose lease building and are finding the environment for subleasing the facility to be quite challenging. With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition-related charges and the related tax impacts, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $136.9 million or $0.57 per diluted share. For fiscal year 2017, GAAP net sales were a record $3.408 billion, gross margins were 51.6%, operating expenses were 43.5% of sales and operating income was 8.1% of sales. Net income from continuing operations was $170.6 million or $0.73 per diluted share. The non-GAAP tax rate was 8.4% in the March quarter and 8.5% for fiscal year 2017. The GAAP tax rate was negative 91% in the March quarter and negative 90% for fiscal year 2017. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% and 9%. And the large difference between our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates relates to the differences and the specific tax rates that apply to the charges that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at March 31, 2017 was $417.2 million. Microchip had 103 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, down one day from that of the end of the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors was at 33 days and up two days from the December quarter. The cash flow from operating activities was a record $322.6 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $1.41 billion, of which about $500 million is domestic cash. Due to our February 2017 refinancing activities, we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit at the end of March. As part of the refinancing activities, we exchanged some of the 2.125% 2037 bonds issued in 2007 for newly issued 2.25% 2037 bonds. There is still $143.75 million of the 2.125% bonds outstanding, for which there is a call date in December 2017. Our current intention is to call any of these bonds that remain outstanding at the call date, and we have classified these bonds as short term on our balance sheet. We continue to make good progress on our leverage, with our net debt to EBITDA ending the March quarter at 1.94; this is down from 2.47 at the end of the December quarter. I remind you that last year when we announced the acquisition of Atmel, we had projected our net debt to EBITDA to be about 3 at the end of the March 2017 quarter, wo we have made tremendous improvements in our business over the past year to get where we are today. We expect our net debt to EBITDA to be about 1.65 by the end of June. Our net debt to EBITDA does not include our 2037 convertible debt, as it is excluded from our banking covenants because it is more equity-like in nature due to its 20-year maturity date. Capital spending was approximately $23 million in the March quarter. For fiscal year 2017, capital expenditures were $75.3 million, and well below our last communicated guidance of $90 million. We expect about $60 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 to be about $170 million. The capital expenditures in the June quarter are high due to rollover of some capital from fiscal 2017 that wasn't received until after year end, due to equipment lead time stretching out. We are aggressively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margins improvements to the business, particularly for the Atmel manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factory. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $32.6 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh? Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased with how our strategic product lines performed in the March quarter and how the combined assets of Microchip and former Atmel working in harmony continue produce differential growth results. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller products performed strongly in the March quarter, with revenue being up 4.4% sequentially as compared to the December quarter, setting a new record in the process. We continue to experience broad-based growth in our business, as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller product lines met or exceeded our expectations for the March quarter. Microcontrollers at over $2.3 billion in annualized revenue represented 64.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our overall 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller portfolio in the broad-based market. Clients using microcontrollers that originated from Atmel heritage continue to gain confidence in Microchip's commitment to these products. As a result, we are seeing more designs that were in the pipeline which are going into production and ramping in volume, as well as continued growth in our design-in funnel, which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time. Last month, Gartner Dataquest released their microcontroller market share report for calendar 2016. We are pleased to report that Microchip retained the number-one position for 8-bit microcontrollers and once again gained market share in calendar 2016. In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we continue to gain market share as we were the fastest-growing franchise among the top players and we remained in the number-five position. In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we gained significant market share again and climbed from the eleventh to the sixth position. For microcontrollers overall, we climbed from the fourth position to the third position and continued our relentless march towards the number-one spot. As the Gartner results demonstrate, we gained significant market share in calendar 2016 and we continue to gain market share in the first quarter of calendar 2017, as evidenced by our March quarter result. And I believe we have the product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. Now moving to our analog products. Our analog product revenue was up 1% sequentially in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter and also set a new record in the process. At close to $925 million in annualized revenue, our analog products represented 25.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We are successfully finding more opportunities to attach Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel microcontrollers and microprocessors at multiple customers and applications. This effort should pay dividends over time as these new design wins go to production. We, in the meanwhile, continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed signal, power, interface, timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our analog products as we march relentlessly here, too, towards making analog a $1 billion revenue business for Microchip. Moving to memory products. Our memory product revenue was sequentially down 2.3% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter. We continue to run our memory product line in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. One last note as we consider our calendar year 2016 performance. Last month Semicast ranked Microchip as the eight-largest automotive semiconductor company, a significant move up from the mid-teens ranking we were at in 2015. Automotive and industrial are important end markets for our growth and consistent performance. And as you will hear in Steve's remarks, these end markets have grown as a share of our overall revenue. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017 and total fiscal year 2017. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2018. Our March quarter financial results were very strong. Our non-GAAP net sales were a record and near the high end of our revised guidance. Our non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share each exceeded well beyond the high end of our guidance. In non-GAAP earnings per share, we blew the top off, with a record earnings per share and up $0.10 above the mid-point of our guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 64.7% from the March quarter of a year ago, due to improving sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage and successful execution of our core business, as well as accretion from our acquisitions. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip, including acquired employees from various acquisitions worldwide, for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 106th consecutive profitable quarter. As I reflect on fiscal year 2017, we had outstanding financial results in every quarter. And closing out the fiscal year with record sales and earnings per share was a befitting tribute to the fiscal year in which we repeatedly hit the ball out of the ballpark. Now let me decipher the financial results of Microchip from the fiscal fourth quarter. We achieved a new all-time high gross margin and operating margin percentage in our core Microchip business, excluding Atmel, substantially exceeding any prior records. On Atmel, the gross margin improved by another 235 basis points sequentially and Atmel's operating margin achieved another all-time record, exceeding 30% for the very first time. We achieved an accretion from Atmel in the March quarter of $0.25 per share versus our guidance of $0.18 to $0.22 per share. The total accretion from Atmel for fiscal year 2017 was $0.69; this was compared to $0.25 accretion as our first estimate after we announced the acquisition and without any stock buyback. By any measure, our March quarter and fiscal year 2017 results are stellar. We're also proud to have achieved 35.6% operating margin for the combined company, which is a stone's throw away from our long-term operating margin target of 36% that we just revised upward last quarter. I want to again thank the worldwide employees of Microchip, including acquired employees of all of our acquisitions, for delivering a stellar and record fiscal year 2017. Now, investors and analysts have frequently asked us about our revenue breakdown by end market. We have not broken those numbers out in more than a decade, as we do not manage our business by end market. Our standard products sell in multiple vertical markets and have a broad appeal across these various markets. We occasionally see end market breakdown mentioned in some analyst reports. Our end market breakdown, though, has changed substantially in the last decade from our various acquisitions, as well as organic growth in several markets, especially industrial and automotive. Therefore, we have done a comprehensive analysis to prepare and update the end market revenue breakdown of our business for our investors and analysts. Based on fiscal year 2017 results, our largest market is industrial, with 35% of our business in this market. The second-largest market is automotive, with 25% of our business. Then comes consumer, with 24% of our business, computing with 9%, communication with 5% and, finally defense and aerospace, with 2% of our business. Over the last several years, our fastest-growing markets have been industrial and automotive, which together account for 60% of our business now. Additionally, our consumer exposure of 24% is not made up of mobile phone; it is made up of home appliances, security systems, thermostats, televisions, remote controls, power tools, drones, joysticks, headphones, furniture, consumer toys, et cetera. With a broad product line and large customer base, compiling our end market breakdown is quite time consuming. We are providing the color for investors to better understand the current complexion of our business by end markets. We do expect to provide this breakdown regularly, but will do so when there is a meaningful change to share. Now, before I go into the guidance for June quarter, let me say a few words about the environment. We are seeing a very strong business environment for our products worldwide. Our bookings rate is extremely strong. As you know, we have not broken out our book-to-bill ratio in a long time, since it is largely misunderstood. However, to make you aware of the strength of our bookings, we are providing this indicator for one time. Our book-to-bill ratio for the March quarter was approximately 1.10. Again, I caution you that bookings are aged out, so a 1.1 book-to-bill ratio does not mean 10% sequential revenue growth. We also take revenue based on sales out from distributors and book-to-bill ratio only measures bookings for sales into distributors. Therefore, the book-to-bill ratio does not represent or help you predict the growth in this quarter, but does give you a sense for the strength of the business environment for our products that we're managing through. Other inventories at Microchip as well as at our distributors are towards the low-end of the normal range, therefore we are starting to see some lengthening of our lead times. We're starting to see challenges in fab, foundry, probe, assembly and test capacity. We have increased wafer starts in our three internal fabs and we're adding capacity in our three back-end facilities. Despite all this, we are seeing significant business that we're not able to support by the customer requested dates. These challenges are more acute with our Atmel-originated products, due to the inadequate capacity plan that we inherited. We are adding capacity to alleviate these challenges as quickly as practical. We also posted a letter on our website on April 4, 2017 informing our customers regarding many of these points. Some of you have questioned our motives posting these letters in the past, suggesting that somehow we were trying to pull ahead backlog. Our bookings were very strong before we posted the letter, and the rate of bookings has not changed after we posted the letter. We believe that our 115,000-plus customers has the right to know about the challenges we face in the current business environment and to prepare for it accordingly. Posting it on the web is the best way to disseminate this information. Now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We expect total net sales to be up between 2% and 7% sequentially. I want to remind investors that in the past five years, we had two acquisitions that closed in the first week of April. Supertex closed on April 1, 2014 and Atmel closed on April 4, 2016. Therefore, mathematically taking average of last five years of sequential growth for the June quarter would give you a large error. Without acquisitions, our average of last five years of sequential growth in the fiscal first quarter was 3%. Therefore, our revenue guidance is substantially above seasonal. We're also not seeing any issues with our automotive business as some others in the industry have commented. We believe that the comments about subsidies in China on electric cars and other automotive comments were more company-specific. Our automotive business has very strong backlog and continues to grow well. Regarding gross margin, as more and more savings from our fab consolidation and cost improvement efforts show up and Atmel gross margins continue to improve due to pricing as well as cost reductions, we see a steady improvement in overall gross margin of the company. We expect gross margin for the June quarter to be between 59.5% and 60% of sales, we expect overall operating expenses to be between 23% and 23.5% of sales and we expect operating profit percentage to be between 36% and 37% of sales and we expect earnings per share to be between $1.17 and $1.27 per share. I would like to remind investors that last quarter we conservatively revised our long-term financial model upwards to a long-term non-GAAP gross margin of 60%, operating expense of 24% and operating profit of 36%. We are now already guiding the June quarter to be at or above this long-term operating profit target, therefore we are revising our long-term operating margin target upwards again. First, let me give you some background. We are seeing an enormous gross margin operating expense and operating profit leverage in our business. We are ramping all of our three fabrication facilities. The increasing utilization lowers the wafer cost. We're also ramping all three of our back-end plants. Atmel's test technology was about a decade behind that of Microchip's in terms of higher amount of parallel testing to achieve higher units per day out of a test system. In many cases, Microchip's units per day per system is 5x to 10x higher than that of Atmel. We are converting many of Atmel's high-volume products to Microchip's test technology that is substantially lowering the cost and improving the output. This continues for the next two years or so. The combined effect of lower wafer cost, more efficient assembly and test technology and stable to increasing prices is that we expect our long-term business model to exceed any prior expectations. Therefore, we are setting our new long-term gross margin target to be 62.5% of sales, we are setting our new long-term operating expense target to be 22.5% of sales and we are setting our new long-term operating profit target to be 40% of sales. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to First Call. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions? Question-and-Answer Session Operator In order to accommodate as many callers as we can, we ask that you ask one question and one follow-up, you may then reenter the queue and we'll take as many questions as time permits. We'll take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the questions and congratulations on the strong results. I guess, Steve, can you help me understand a little bit relative to you increasing CapEx, increasing wafer starts, when do you think you'll be able to catch up with the demand curve here in the near term? And I guess you said in the press release that there's a considerable amount of demand that you can't meet right now. Any way that you can help us quantify what you're leaving on the table in the near term? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. So in terms of CapEx, the majority of CapEx that we're adding is in the back end. As I mentioned, Atmel's test technology was about a decade behind. And we're converting many of Atmel's high-volume products to Microchip's assembly test technology. The challenge with that is that the easiest way to add quickly incremental capacity is to buy up more of what they have, more of what we have in Atmel, same test systems, same capacity. But that is very, very inefficient. And if we buy more of that, we get stuck with it for five to seven years in a high-cost structure. So we're trying to buy more efficient capacity, Microchip type, which then requires the writing the test programs, converting them to Microchip's test technology, correlating and doing all that, which takes a little longer. So it's a very fine juggling exercise to reasonably able to satisfy the customers and not have lines down and yet keep a steady march towards converting those products to a very low-cost technology, which is giving gross margin improvements and all that. So driven by all that, there is significant constraint. We are unable to dollarize the constraint for you today because it changes every day. We don't know where we will end up at the end of the quarter. We know the number where we ended up last quarter, but I think we're less comfortable in sharing it. I did want to say one other thing, John. After our last earnings call, I saw in your report where you said we see Microchip entering uncharted levels of operational efficiencies and leverage, which should support long-term operating margin of 40%. You were right on. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC I get lucky every once in a while. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. You're were, well, either good or lucky. Probably good. It seems that you were right on. You saw something that we saw too, but we were not ready to commit yet and not ready to guide to a 40% operating margin target yet. And we are now and we have guided as such. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Well, see, maybe that's good lead into my second question. Clearly the scale you've amassed is giving you leverage on the operating line. I'm curious as to what benefits you might be able to see on the top line from your scale, just given that the markets you've played in have been pretty diverse. I guess are we seeing a trend where customers want to deal with fewer suppliers who can do more, and do you think that that's a long-term sort of advantage for you to perhaps gain share at a faster clip than you historically have? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. So I think I would say, in our commentary, we have been very careful to not describe the market environment to be anything other than for our products. If you re-listen to what I said, I used it twice, the market environment for our products. We didn't really make any commentary on general market environment. You could talk to everybody else. That's kind of your job to figure out the general market environment. We described it for our products. So baked in in that environment is also tremendous leverage that we are getting attaching the vast portfolio of our analog products, memory products, to Wi-Fi products, to Bluetooth and others, along with various microcontroller and other products we have. Now, we have sort of 19 different product lines within Microchip today and we're getting enormous leverage in what you call attach in the past, and we have given it a new term at Microchip; we call it Total System Solutions. So, if you look at the number of devices per board that we had, let's say, five years ago, it's dramatically increasing in terms of number of devices we have per customer board today. I can't give you the number. But that is accelerating and, therefore, somewhat we're creating our own environment. There is a tremendous organic growth we have seen in our business in the last year. And if you just recall a year ago, there were organic growth concerns. And at the same time, we have added some acquisitions. So if you just look at the March quarter, we beat the earnings by $0.10. $0.05 came from higher Atmel accretion and other $0.05 came from core Microchip. So it's not one or the other. We are really just accelerating on both fronts. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Perfect. Thanks, guys. And congratulations. Operator We'll go next to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks. Steve, with John's successful run at 40 percentile, I'll promise not to raise the bar to 45% op margins. But if we can talk about just that attach rate as a follow-up, particularly for wireless connectivity, what you're seeing for MCU with wireless attach and the momentum in that market. Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. We have many, many embedded systems adding connectivity to them. Certainly, wireless is a big component of that, but we also have wired connectivity in many systems. And our portfolio of connectivity is extremely rich at this point between successive acquisitions that have added to our portfolio. So embedded systems in general are becoming more valuable when they're attached. We're finding lots of opportunities for Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRa, a number of other proprietary standards, to help these systems connect to whatever is appropriate in their environment. And it is a part of the growth that we're experiencing. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Got it. And then as my follow-up, can you talk about 32-bit, and I know you guys have the MIPS as well as the Atmel ARM core and I know there is more focus on the peripherals than the core. But just wanted to get a sense now that you're a year into Atmel, just some of the design win and product momentum that you're seeing in the marketplace for 32-bit ARM? Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. So we don't think of it as 32-bit ARM alone. We look at overall 32-bit business. The 32-bit product line has been growing faster than Microchip average growth that we've had. We have fully incorporated the products that came to us from Atmel, what we call the SAM products, and the products historical for Microchip, the PIC32, into our integrated roadmaps as we present it out into our customer base when we pursue new designs. And they're doing very well. And we see strengths in the portfolio that we inherited from Atmel that have taken us to new areas, not only in microcontrollers. We've also got microprocessors that were part of the portfolio. And then we have some strengths from classic microchip that continue on their efforts. And the forward-going portfolio has a single roadmap. We've brought that all together. And we're very, very confident in the 32-bit product line and its growth under the Microchip cloud (35:30). Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks, Ganesh. Operator We'll take our next question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yes. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong results and thanks very much for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about capital allocation going forward, especially now that you've done better than you had anticipated on the leverage levels coming down. How should we think about the company's interest in engaging an additional M&A? And what are your thoughts around doing share repurchases? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. So, I think it's quite simple. There are three uses of capital. There can be three different uses: using it in our own business in making investments, giving it as a dividend or using it as M&A, and you can call it maybe, fourth, stock buyback. We're getting extreme leverage on the operating expense side in our business. And it does not seem like we will have a need to go outside of our P&L model to make really a lot of OpEx or any kind of investments. In terms of CapEx, even the number we guided for the year is really a small portion of the overall yearly revenue, even though the Q1 is high, a little bit front-end loaded, largely because of slip of capital from last quarter. In terms of dividend, our dividend strategy does not change. The board is committed to continue with the dividend we have and a very, very small minuscule increase every quarter. There is no desire to really do anything different. And as far as stock buyback is concerned, we do not regularly buy back stock. We've only bought it at extreme occasions. Last time we bought stock was when we had to issue some stock in the Micrel acquisition and we wanted it to be a cash transaction, so we bought the stock back. So that really leaves M&A. Atmel acquisition now was about a year ago. It's largely consolidated. But as I mentioned, a lot of the back-end and other challenges still remain. We're still trying to convert their test technology, assembly technology, to ours, which will take some time. So if a reasonable acquisition falls in our plate, we're willing to execute it. But the valuations are fairly high right now and there is really nothing imminent that we have on our plate. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. That's helpful. And then for a follow-up question I was just hoping you could help us understand what steps we should think about in terms of bridging from the company's margin levels today toward the targets. You talk a lot about the changes to Atmel's back-end operations and some potential additional leverage as you go forward. Are those the two things that get the company to its target margin ranges? Or are there other things that we should have in mind that the company would execute on to get to those levels? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Well, it's a little broader than that. We are seeing tremendous gains in reduction in wafer process essentially (38:51), both by increasing loadings in all of our three fabs as well as being able to cross-pollinate and use ours as well as Atmel technology for each of those products, whichever the best solution may be. They were good in certain things; we were good in certain things. Certain products will be cheaper here; certain products will be cheaper there. So we're getting a significant leverage out of fabs. And then, as you mentioned, we're getting significant leverage out of assembly and test technology. And overall we're getting a lot of operating expense leverage, a lot of other manufacturing leverage also out of the same footprint in our facilities and all that just pumping a tremendous amount of output. Recall that Atmel did no assembly themselves; they were zero percent assembly and they only did 10% of the tests themselves. Microchip, on the other hand, did nearly 90% of our tests ourselves and we did about 70% of our assembly ourselves. So two companies combined together now, both assembly and test percentages done in-house have dramatically gone down because of Atmel. And as we bring those things from subcontractors to inside and in the process also increase the utilization and increase the output by 5x to 10x per system per day, the results are tremendous. They're just beyond what we could have expected and beyond the leverage that we could reasonably describe. And I must say that this detail level of due diligence was not available to us. Very poor due diligence was shared. It's because we were ahead on competitors and all that. So a lot of this area we have really done it on our own clock, identify the areas where we could bring significant cost reduction. And we are basically in the process of implementing the first high-volume products on microcontrollers and memories and a few other products are already flowing out of our manufacturing facility. So this is not a pipe dream. We have delivered the front-end of that already. Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. I would add pricing discipline as the other element that we're proud of (41:20) over the last year to help improve the overall gross margins. J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc. Maybe one other thing to add is that there's still benefits from the shutdown of the Micrel fab that aren't seeing recognized in the P&L we've today. So still a lot of things we're working on together. The things that Steve is talking about Atmel, that's a couple year project. So we've got a lot of headroom and things to work on over the coming quarters. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you very much. Operator We'll take our next question from Chris Danely with Citi. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hey. Thanks, guys. First question is just on the lead time extensions. I know you have several different products with several different lead times. But if you could, is there any way to quantify the amount of the lead time extensions? And then, Steve, when was the last time you saw this type of lead time extensions? And then do you think you'll be able to catch up the demand over the summer. Or do you think they can get worse? Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. It's not getting worse. Unlike what some of the people on the Street think, the letter has not accelerated the bookings in any way. It didn't accelerate the bookings last time. It didn't accelerate the bookings this time. The letter was posted on April 4, and we received these tremendous bookings in the March quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.1. And it did not change afterward. Our customers are fairly trained on they expect that – we written this letter about 10 times probably in the last 20 years or so. It's results were less than optimal one time a couple of years ago, which, soon after that, the China market fell apart. And, as a result, we had a miss. And many times, the Street just remembers what happened last time. So these letters have been very effective in informing our large 115,000-plus customers regarding what is happening and then working with them to understand the requirements, being able to build the product in a better mix to understand people's drop-dead requirements so people don't go lines down. So I can't give you one number across the range of our products, 100,000-plus SKUs. People kind of like to look at one number what the lead time is, and there's no such number. On a given product, lead time could be eight weeks today, and you get one large order and the lead time goes to 12 weeks because the parts which were after the eight weeks are now booked. On the other hand, there are plenty of products available on the shelf. So the lead time can be anywhere from in-stock to 16 weeks, I would say. All over the place. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. And we're working hard to try to get the delinquencies all down by the September quarter timeframe. It all depends on what happens in terms of the bookings on a continuing basis. But that's what all the firepower in the company is aimed towards. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Great. You mean, Steve, just going to sit in the office and call 115,000 customers and tell them that the lead times are extending? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. That's what the letter's for. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. So my next question is just some clarifications on the margins. In terms of the new targets, is that like half from Atmel and half from the legacy Microchip? And then just in terms of the all this accretion and upside you've seen on Atmel's operating margins, can you break out how much is COGS versus your operating expenditures? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Well, Atmel's both gross and operating margins still remain well behind Microchip's. And as I mentioned, Atmel's operating margin, we got it over 30% and gross margin was up another 235 points. Despite those numbers, they're still substantially behind Microchip's. And we've always said, based on the large amount of mix they've taken before, we never expect that to make 40% operating margin, which really means core goes above and Atmel is below and we bracket an average to about 40%. So the improvement will really come from both. As we are ramping our fabs, it's lowering wafer cost and helping both gross margin. As we are bringing Atmel's assembly test technology to Microchip's level, the help of that transition to our technology is helping Atmel gross margin, but it's bringing much more output into our factories from outside, which then is also increasing core gross margins. J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc. Spreading the overhead over a larger base. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Spreading the overhead over a larger base, allowing us to buy more volume of lead frames to packages to molding compounds to everything else in a larger supply with better economics and all that. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator We'll go next to William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thanks for taking my question. And I'll add my congrats as well. I'd like to ask about the characterization of this cycle, Steve, as you've done in the past. Clearly, we're heading into a time of a bit of tightness, a bit of this imbalance between supply and demand. How much of what you're seeing is more related to lack of capacity in the Atmel product versus accelerating demand? And do you anticipate we'll continue to see improving year-over-year growth beyond the June timeframe, which is I think the sort of consensus view at least among sell-side analysts? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Again, I will refrain from making any general remarks about the industry and largely focusing on how I see the business environment for our products. A significant impact of what we are seeing is really driven by the success of our own products in the market and the total (47:51) that I earlier talked about. Number one, there was a significant reluctance on the part of the customers during the year that Atmel was up for sale, regarding what would happen to those products, what would be supported and would not be supported. And if you, as a customer, have a concern, then you kind of always have a back-up plan in case those products were not to be available. When it became clear that Microchip would buy Atmel, customers were more even disheartened originally thinking that Microchip being a staunch competitor may discontinue AVR and ARM-based products and others. What we did was just the opposite. And as Ganesh mentioned in his commentary, the result of all that has been a tremendous amount of customer confidence that we have gained in our strategy, in what we are doing. And we're getting unfair share of the design wins and customers' ear. and then analog and Wi-Fi and memory and other attach to boot. So a large portion is really driven by that. There are always small numbers that can really drive a significant change. Beyond that, we're also seeing general strength in the economy, especially happened post-election in U.S. The whole world seems to be positive. You can talk to distributors and they are seeing strong bookings and a strong environment. Lead time for equipment is lengthening, lead time for packages, all sorts of things is lengthening. So those are some of the signs of what's happening generally in the economy. But I think what we are seeing has really also a significant company-specific element on the top of that. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thanks for that. And one follow-up, if I can. Eric, I think more your area of expertise. I think there is a FASB pronouncement that's going to require you to transition to a sell-in rev rec. Can you confirm that that's correct and, if so, the timing and anticipated impact on your reported financials? J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc. Yeah, so that change will be effective for Microchip April 1, 2018, so the beginning of our next fiscal year. We are going through the planning process associated with that. I guess what should be important from an investor standpoint is we are not going to change in any way our go-to-market strategy with our distributors, the way that we price our products, the way that we interact with them. But the reporting will have to be on a sell-in basis, where essentially you're making an estimation of what the net sales price of the product that you're shipping in is going to be. So our accounting team is working through that and will be effective for us next year. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thanks. And congrats again. Operator We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Congratulations on the solid results execution and the outlook. As we think about growth and as it relates to Atmel's design win pipeline, I know you guys recently refreshed Atmel's AVR 8-bit product line. I think you guys even embedded some of your own IP into this particular product line. I know you guys do a good job of keeping track of design win rates. So, wondering if you've seen a step-up in design wins or feedback from customers for the new AVR 8-bit products? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. It just depends on what timeframe you compare against. So, we have been at it for a year since we bought the company. And the funnel size is enormous. We're seeing substantial growth and the total funnel size on Microchip across 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, Wi-Fi, our networking business, our automotive business, infotainment, MOST business, that the funnel size across Microchip is just enormous. I think we are incredibly and beautifully set up to really deliver what we are telling you. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks for the insights there. And then, on the analog side, you guys are basically within striking distance of $1 billion in annualized sales. I think last I asked this question, about 50% of these products are tied to your MCU programs and the other 50% is sold kind of standalone on their own performance merits. Is that still the right mix? Or are you getting more attraction on a standalone basis? And then maybe any updates on your analog attach rates to Atmel's MCUs. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Well, we don't really look at the analog business to be either attaching to our microcontrollers or standalone. We want to succeed in both. If we had a very high attach rate but never won anything standalone, that, to us, would be negative because that really means we can only win when it's our microcontroller. That's not the case. Even if we don't win the microcontroller, and it's a microcontroller from Freescale, Renesas, NXP, or anybody, or maybe the socket doesn't have a microcontroller, it is driven off a microprocessor or a FPGA or some sort of SoC, we still want to be able to win analog in those sockets, rather it's a – for power management or convertors or have some Wi-Fi on it or have some supervisory op amps or some other things. So right now I think as we look across, we have victory in every area. We are winning around our microcontroller, we're winning around Atmel's microcontroller and we're winning around other people's microcontrollers, SoC, FPGA, processors, et cetera, and there is no specific focus to be one way or the other. We actually have identified a built-in large opportunity to attach analog around Atmel's microcontrollers because those were the sockets we were purposely kept out. Any of the reference designs that Atmel produced before, by design they would put anybody else in it but Microchip. In the last one year, all those reference designs, tools, development tools, et cetera, they've all been refurbished to replace anybody's analog and Wi-Fi with Microchip's. So there you have incremental additive analog that we should be able to attach. And we are. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks for the insight, Steve. Operator For our next question, we'll go to Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Robert Mertens - Needham & Co. LLC Hi. This is Robert Mertens on behalf of Rajvindra. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. You broke out the revenue breakdown by end market. You had about 25% in the automotive end market and you mentioned that this was around the eighth largest semi supplier. Do you have any visibility towards what areas of automotive you're seeing your products go into, if there's strength in infotainment versus ADAS or power management? Or any granularity there would be great. Thank you. Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. We are in a broad range of applications, but we have some specific ones we have a larger exposure to – so you mentioned infotainment. But I'd broaden that to networking inside the car as one area. We are in many access control applications in the car. We are in touch control for a range of both touch screen and touch buttons and things. We're in many USB connectivity inside the car. We're in all the garage door openers inside the car. So it's a pretty broad set of applications and with some specific areas in which we have a much higher penetration than even normal. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. I think we have 51 chips in a Mercedes S-Class car, 55 in a Hyundai Genesis. It's everywhere, up and down the car. So, it's much more broader than anybody can describe. Robert Mertens - Needham & Co. LLC Okay. And then in terms of I guess products going from the high end S-class to Hyundai Genesis and going more mid-market, are you seeing that be a trend that's taking off now or still a quarter or so out? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Well, those trends don't happen in a quarter. If you look at the keyless entry, where you don't need the mechanical key anymore, began nearly 20 years ago from General Motor (sic) [General Motors] cars. I think we put the first keyless entry where you don't have to use a mechanical key to open the car. We did the first hotel room door lock years ago. Before that, there used to be mechanical keys that even opened the hotel room door lock. And as you have seen over the years, people don't even know there's a mechanical key exists for hotel rooms or cars and stuff like that. So these changes are a lot slower, happen over time. These are not one quarter phenomena. There are 400 different car models that have the HomeLink on it, all-exclusive product of Microchip. There are many hundreds of models that have our MOST bus. There are a large number of models that have our touch in it, and so on and so forth. They all start at the high level and, every year in the following model year, the company will take it down to the middle-range models. And a few years from now, it could get to the lower-end models. Feature-by-feature they migrate down, but the trend doesn't change as much quarter-to-quarter. Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. I think the way to think about it is we have a high presence in all car segments; it's not just at the high end that we are present. That was just an example to show you in a rich environment of electronics, we have a pretty high percentage. But if you look at the lower-end cars, we have just as high a percentage in many of those cars. Robert Mertens - Needham & Co. LLC Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator We'll go now to Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna Financial Group. Liz Pate - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Hi, guys. This is Liz Pate in for Chris Rolland. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just a quick one on the pricing environment. Maybe you can talk about how that is currently industry-wide, and specifically on the Atmel products. Do you still have some ability to raise prices on those products? And thanks. Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. So we've been talking about it for multiple quarters. It's taken us time to implement the price changes across a broad range of customers. Some of them have been phased-in over time so that they don't all come together in one quarter. But I would say, at this point in time, a substantial portion of the price increases that we've began last June or so are in place. And as we go in – going forward, it's really no programmed increases in prices. What we have done is also put in a significant discipline on new designs, because what we were doing with the price increases was correcting past issues where pricing was done poorly. And those new designs are all being done using a more disciplined process to make sure that we don't have to come back and change the pricing out in time. But pricing for our market tends to be something that it happens at the point of a design-in, and so that's when the competition for what the best performance price-value equation is. And then that happens a year or two before designs usually go into production and there isn't as much pricing discussion that takes place once the designs have been completed and production is getting started. Liz Pate - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Okay. Thanks. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. I want to add, though, that to extend what Ganesh said, that as all the new quotes we are making, really in the last year, have all substantially better disciplined pricing than the average pricing we are having on Atmel parts today, as these designs are going to production, it has been about a year now. So designs are starting to go to production on those things that we quoted on our clock. There will be a steady stream of wind on the back where every quarter the mix gets richer and richer with higher and higher percentage of pricing to be better disciplined pricing coming from Microchip and smaller and smaller percentage of older devices on which we raised the price, but we couldn't raise it all the way to where the new prices are. So this would be a long-term tailwind that will continue to blow in the back. Liz Pate - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Perfect. Thanks. And congrats on the quarter. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Thanks. Operator We'll go now to Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on your execution. The first question is a gross margin question maybe most appropriate for Eric. I believe the company was expecting to see the benefit of the Micrel San Jose fab shutdown in the first part of the calendar quarter. Is that in fact happening? And, if so, is it more in the calendar first quarter, calendar second quarter or more evenly distributed? J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc. So I would say the benefits from the Micrel shutdown have been coming over time. We still probably have a couple of quarters to go as we sell through all the older inventory and all the 8-inch inventory starts to be realized in the cost of sales. So we have got benefits from that the last two quarters, but expect that to continue on in the June and September quarters also. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Thanks, Eric. And then the follow-up question is for Steve. And, Steve, it goes back to a comment that I think you made a few calls ago, when you indicated that, if industry were to grow, I think the number was high-single digits or 10%, I don't recall specifically, that that would favor vertically integrated manufacturers. So my question is this. With demand strong, with the global economy showing signs of improvement and with what appears to have been a five-year period of fairly disappointing analog CapEx, are you seeing signs in your business where the environment is favoring a vertically integrated manufacturer, like Microchip? And, if not, do you think that will occur later this year, or is that something that would be further into the future? Thank you. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Well, I think it is happening already. You are seeing it on our results and you will see it in our results in the coming quarters also. If Atmel was a standalone company today, they wouldn't be able to take advantage of these tremendous improvements we're making on assembly test technology inside capacity being able to bring large volumes on our test technology already running in our Thailand facility producing 5x higher output per system. Subcontractors have no incentive to give you that kind of output. They get paid by the hour on the test system. So if you dramatically improve output and output goes up 5x and now you only have to pay them for 20% of the hours, they're not happy. So there the incentives are not aligned properly. You're seeing tremendous benefit of our vertical manufacturing, both from fab, probe, assembly and tests already and you will continue to see it as we go forward. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Very helpful. Thank you. Operator That does conclude today's question and answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back to Mr. Steve Sanghi for any final remarks. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Well, thank you, everybody. We are pleased to deliver an outstanding quarter and an outstanding fiscal year. And watch us grow, hopefully we can deliver another one. And we'll see some of you at the conferences we will go to later this quarter. Thank you. Operator This does conclude today's conference.

We'll take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the questions and congratulations on the strong results. I guess, Steve, can you help me understand a little bit relative to you increasing CapEx, increasing wafer starts, when do you think you'll be able to catch up with the demand curve here in the near term? And I guess you said in the press release that there's a considerable amount of demand that you can't meet right now. Any way that you can help us quantify what you're leaving on the table in the near term? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. So in terms of CapEx, the majority of CapEx that we're adding is in the back end. As I mentioned, Atmel's test technology was about a decade behind. And we're converting many of Atmel's high-volume products to Microchip's assembly test technology. The challenge with that is that the easiest way to add quickly incremental capacity is to buy up more of what they have, more of what we have in Atmel, same test systems, same capacity. But that is very, very inefficient. And if we buy more of that, we get stuck with it for five to seven years in a high-cost structure. So we're trying to buy more efficient capacity, Microchip type, which then requires the writing the test programs, converting them to Microchip's test technology, correlating and doing all that, which takes a little longer. So it's a very fine juggling exercise to reasonably able to satisfy the customers and not have lines down and yet keep a steady march towards converting those products to a very low-cost technology, which is giving gross margin improvements and all that. So driven by all that, there is significant constraint. We are unable to dollarize the constraint for you today because it changes every day. We don't know where we will end up at the end of the quarter. We know the number where we ended up last quarter, but I think we're less comfortable in sharing it. I did want to say one other thing, John. After our last earnings call, I saw in your report where you said we see Microchip entering uncharted levels of operational efficiencies and leverage, which should support long-term operating margin of 40%. You were right on. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC I get lucky every once in a while. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. You're were, well, either good or lucky. Probably good. It seems that you were right on. You saw something that we saw too, but we were not ready to commit yet and not ready to guide to a 40% operating margin target yet. And we are now and we have guided as such. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Well, see, maybe that's good lead into my second question. Clearly the scale you've amassed is giving you leverage on the operating line. I'm curious as to what benefits you might be able to see on the top line from your scale, just given that the markets you've played in have been pretty diverse. I guess are we seeing a trend where customers want to deal with fewer suppliers who can do more, and do you think that that's a long-term sort of advantage for you to perhaps gain share at a faster clip than you historically have? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. So I think I would say, in our commentary, we have been very careful to not describe the market environment to be anything other than for our products. If you re-listen to what I said, I used it twice, the market environment for our products. We didn't really make any commentary on general market environment. You could talk to everybody else. That's kind of your job to figure out the general market environment. We described it for our products. So baked in in that environment is also tremendous leverage that we are getting attaching the vast portfolio of our analog products, memory products, to Wi-Fi products, to Bluetooth and others, along with various microcontroller and other products we have. Now, we have sort of 19 different product lines within Microchip today and we're getting enormous leverage in what you call attach in the past, and we have given it a new term at Microchip; we call it Total System Solutions. So, if you look at the number of devices per board that we had, let's say, five years ago, it's dramatically increasing in terms of number of devices we have per customer board today. I can't give you the number. But that is accelerating and, therefore, somewhat we're creating our own environment. There is a tremendous organic growth we have seen in our business in the last year. And if you just recall a year ago, there were organic growth concerns. And at the same time, we have added some acquisitions. So if you just look at the March quarter, we beat the earnings by $0.10. $0.05 came from higher Atmel accretion and other $0.05 came from core Microchip. So it's not one or the other. We are really just accelerating on both fronts. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Perfect. Thanks, guys. And congratulations. Operator We'll go next to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks. Steve, with John's successful run at 40 percentile, I'll promise not to raise the bar to 45% op margins. But if we can talk about just that attach rate as a follow-up, particularly for wireless connectivity, what you're seeing for MCU with wireless attach and the momentum in that market. Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. We have many, many embedded systems adding connectivity to them. Certainly, wireless is a big component of that, but we also have wired connectivity in many systems. And our portfolio of connectivity is extremely rich at this point between successive acquisitions that have added to our portfolio. So embedded systems in general are becoming more valuable when they're attached. We're finding lots of opportunities for Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRa, a number of other proprietary standards, to help these systems connect to whatever is appropriate in their environment. And it is a part of the growth that we're experiencing. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Got it. And then as my follow-up, can you talk about 32-bit, and I know you guys have the MIPS as well as the Atmel ARM core and I know there is more focus on the peripherals than the core. But just wanted to get a sense now that you're a year into Atmel, just some of the design win and product momentum that you're seeing in the marketplace for 32-bit ARM? Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. So we don't think of it as 32-bit ARM alone. We look at overall 32-bit business. The 32-bit product line has been growing faster than Microchip average growth that we've had. We have fully incorporated the products that came to us from Atmel, what we call the SAM products, and the products historical for Microchip, the PIC32, into our integrated roadmaps as we present it out into our customer base when we pursue new designs. And they're doing very well. And we see strengths in the portfolio that we inherited from Atmel that have taken us to new areas, not only in microcontrollers. We've also got microprocessors that were part of the portfolio. And then we have some strengths from classic microchip that continue on their efforts. And the forward-going portfolio has a single roadmap. We've brought that all together. And we're very, very confident in the 32-bit product line and its growth under the Microchip cloud (35:30). Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks, Ganesh. Operator We'll take our next question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yes. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong results and thanks very much for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about capital allocation going forward, especially now that you've done better than you had anticipated on the leverage levels coming down. How should we think about the company's interest in engaging an additional M&A? And what are your thoughts around doing share repurchases? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. So, I think it's quite simple. There are three uses of capital. There can be three different uses: using it in our own business in making investments, giving it as a dividend or using it as M&A, and you can call it maybe, fourth, stock buyback. We're getting extreme leverage on the operating expense side in our business. And it does not seem like we will have a need to go outside of our P&L model to make really a lot of OpEx or any kind of investments. In terms of CapEx, even the number we guided for the year is really a small portion of the overall yearly revenue, even though the Q1 is high, a little bit front-end loaded, largely because of slip of capital from last quarter. In terms of dividend, our dividend strategy does not change. The board is committed to continue with the dividend we have and a very, very small minuscule increase every quarter. There is no desire to really do anything different. And as far as stock buyback is concerned, we do not regularly buy back stock. We've only bought it at extreme occasions. Last time we bought stock was when we had to issue some stock in the Micrel acquisition and we wanted it to be a cash transaction, so we bought the stock back. So that really leaves M&A. Atmel acquisition now was about a year ago. It's largely consolidated. But as I mentioned, a lot of the back-end and other challenges still remain. We're still trying to convert their test technology, assembly technology, to ours, which will take some time. So if a reasonable acquisition falls in our plate, we're willing to execute it. But the valuations are fairly high right now and there is really nothing imminent that we have on our plate. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. That's helpful. And then for a follow-up question I was just hoping you could help us understand what steps we should think about in terms of bridging from the company's margin levels today toward the targets. You talk a lot about the changes to Atmel's back-end operations and some potential additional leverage as you go forward. Are those the two things that get the company to its target margin ranges? Or are there other things that we should have in mind that the company would execute on to get to those levels? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Well, it's a little broader than that. We are seeing tremendous gains in reduction in wafer process essentially (38:51), both by increasing loadings in all of our three fabs as well as being able to cross-pollinate and use ours as well as Atmel technology for each of those products, whichever the best solution may be. They were good in certain things; we were good in certain things. Certain products will be cheaper here; certain products will be cheaper there. So we're getting a significant leverage out of fabs. And then, as you mentioned, we're getting significant leverage out of assembly and test technology. And overall we're getting a lot of operating expense leverage, a lot of other manufacturing leverage also out of the same footprint in our facilities and all that just pumping a tremendous amount of output. Recall that Atmel did no assembly themselves; they were zero percent assembly and they only did 10% of the tests themselves. Microchip, on the other hand, did nearly 90% of our tests ourselves and we did about 70% of our assembly ourselves. So two companies combined together now, both assembly and test percentages done in-house have dramatically gone down because of Atmel. And as we bring those things from subcontractors to inside and in the process also increase the utilization and increase the output by 5x to 10x per system per day, the results are tremendous. They're just beyond what we could have expected and beyond the leverage that we could reasonably describe. And I must say that this detail level of due diligence was not available to us. Very poor due diligence was shared. It's because we were ahead on competitors and all that. So a lot of this area we have really done it on our own clock, identify the areas where we could bring significant cost reduction. And we are basically in the process of implementing the first high-volume products on microcontrollers and memories and a few other products are already flowing out of our manufacturing facility. So this is not a pipe dream. We have delivered the front-end of that already. Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. I would add pricing discipline as the other element that we're proud of (41:20) over the last year to help improve the overall gross margins. J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc. Maybe one other thing to add is that there's still benefits from the shutdown of the Micrel fab that aren't seeing recognized in the P&L we've today. So still a lot of things we're working on together. The things that Steve is talking about Atmel, that's a couple year project. So we've got a lot of headroom and things to work on over the coming quarters. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you very much. Operator We'll take our next question from Chris Danely with Citi. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hey. Thanks, guys. First question is just on the lead time extensions. I know you have several different products with several different lead times. But if you could, is there any way to quantify the amount of the lead time extensions? And then, Steve, when was the last time you saw this type of lead time extensions? And then do you think you'll be able to catch up the demand over the summer. Or do you think they can get worse? Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. It's not getting worse. Unlike what some of the people on the Street think, the letter has not accelerated the bookings in any way. It didn't accelerate the bookings last time. It didn't accelerate the bookings this time. The letter was posted on April 4, and we received these tremendous bookings in the March quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.1. And it did not change afterward. Our customers are fairly trained on they expect that – we written this letter about 10 times probably in the last 20 years or so. It's results were less than optimal one time a couple of years ago, which, soon after that, the China market fell apart. And, as a result, we had a miss. And many times, the Street just remembers what happened last time. So these letters have been very effective in informing our large 115,000-plus customers regarding what is happening and then working with them to understand the requirements, being able to build the product in a better mix to understand people's drop-dead requirements so people don't go lines down. So I can't give you one number across the range of our products, 100,000-plus SKUs. People kind of like to look at one number what the lead time is, and there's no such number. On a given product, lead time could be eight weeks today, and you get one large order and the lead time goes to 12 weeks because the parts which were after the eight weeks are now booked. On the other hand, there are plenty of products available on the shelf. So the lead time can be anywhere from in-stock to 16 weeks, I would say. All over the place. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. And we're working hard to try to get the delinquencies all down by the September quarter timeframe. It all depends on what happens in terms of the bookings on a continuing basis. But that's what all the firepower in the company is aimed towards. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Great. You mean, Steve, just going to sit in the office and call 115,000 customers and tell them that the lead times are extending? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. That's what the letter's for. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. So my next question is just some clarifications on the margins. In terms of the new targets, is that like half from Atmel and half from the legacy Microchip? And then just in terms of the all this accretion and upside you've seen on Atmel's operating margins, can you break out how much is COGS versus your operating expenditures? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Well, Atmel's both gross and operating margins still remain well behind Microchip's. And as I mentioned, Atmel's operating margin, we got it over 30% and gross margin was up another 235 points. Despite those numbers, they're still substantially behind Microchip's. And we've always said, based on the large amount of mix they've taken before, we never expect that to make 40% operating margin, which really means core goes above and Atmel is below and we bracket an average to about 40%. So the improvement will really come from both. As we are ramping our fabs, it's lowering wafer cost and helping both gross margin. As we are bringing Atmel's assembly test technology to Microchip's level, the help of that transition to our technology is helping Atmel gross margin, but it's bringing much more output into our factories from outside, which then is also increasing core gross margins. J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc. Spreading the overhead over a larger base. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Spreading the overhead over a larger base, allowing us to buy more volume of lead frames to packages to molding compounds to everything else in a larger supply with better economics and all that. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator We'll go next to William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thanks for taking my question. And I'll add my congrats as well. I'd like to ask about the characterization of this cycle, Steve, as you've done in the past. Clearly, we're heading into a time of a bit of tightness, a bit of this imbalance between supply and demand. How much of what you're seeing is more related to lack of capacity in the Atmel product versus accelerating demand? And do you anticipate we'll continue to see improving year-over-year growth beyond the June timeframe, which is I think the sort of consensus view at least among sell-side analysts? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Again, I will refrain from making any general remarks about the industry and largely focusing on how I see the business environment for our products. A significant impact of what we are seeing is really driven by the success of our own products in the market and the total (47:51) that I earlier talked about. Number one, there was a significant reluctance on the part of the customers during the year that Atmel was up for sale, regarding what would happen to those products, what would be supported and would not be supported. And if you, as a customer, have a concern, then you kind of always have a back-up plan in case those products were not to be available. When it became clear that Microchip would buy Atmel, customers were more even disheartened originally thinking that Microchip being a staunch competitor may discontinue AVR and ARM-based products and others. What we did was just the opposite. And as Ganesh mentioned in his commentary, the result of all that has been a tremendous amount of customer confidence that we have gained in our strategy, in what we are doing. And we're getting unfair share of the design wins and customers' ear. and then analog and Wi-Fi and memory and other attach to boot. So a large portion is really driven by that. There are always small numbers that can really drive a significant change. Beyond that, we're also seeing general strength in the economy, especially happened post-election in U.S. The whole world seems to be positive. You can talk to distributors and they are seeing strong bookings and a strong environment. Lead time for equipment is lengthening, lead time for packages, all sorts of things is lengthening. So those are some of the signs of what's happening generally in the economy. But I think what we are seeing has really also a significant company-specific element on the top of that. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thanks for that. And one follow-up, if I can. Eric, I think more your area of expertise. I think there is a FASB pronouncement that's going to require you to transition to a sell-in rev rec. Can you confirm that that's correct and, if so, the timing and anticipated impact on your reported financials? J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc. Yeah, so that change will be effective for Microchip April 1, 2018, so the beginning of our next fiscal year. We are going through the planning process associated with that. I guess what should be important from an investor standpoint is we are not going to change in any way our go-to-market strategy with our distributors, the way that we price our products, the way that we interact with them. But the reporting will have to be on a sell-in basis, where essentially you're making an estimation of what the net sales price of the product that you're shipping in is going to be. So our accounting team is working through that and will be effective for us next year. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thanks. And congrats again. Operator We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Congratulations on the solid results execution and the outlook. As we think about growth and as it relates to Atmel's design win pipeline, I know you guys recently refreshed Atmel's AVR 8-bit product line. I think you guys even embedded some of your own IP into this particular product line. I know you guys do a good job of keeping track of design win rates. So, wondering if you've seen a step-up in design wins or feedback from customers for the new AVR 8-bit products? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. It just depends on what timeframe you compare against. So, we have been at it for a year since we bought the company. And the funnel size is enormous. We're seeing substantial growth and the total funnel size on Microchip across 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, Wi-Fi, our networking business, our automotive business, infotainment, MOST business, that the funnel size across Microchip is just enormous. I think we are incredibly and beautifully set up to really deliver what we are telling you. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks for the insights there. And then, on the analog side, you guys are basically within striking distance of $1 billion in annualized sales. I think last I asked this question, about 50% of these products are tied to your MCU programs and the other 50% is sold kind of standalone on their own performance merits. Is that still the right mix? Or are you getting more attraction on a standalone basis? And then maybe any updates on your analog attach rates to Atmel's MCUs. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Well, we don't really look at the analog business to be either attaching to our microcontrollers or standalone. We want to succeed in both. If we had a very high attach rate but never won anything standalone, that, to us, would be negative because that really means we can only win when it's our microcontroller. That's not the case. Even if we don't win the microcontroller, and it's a microcontroller from Freescale, Renesas, NXP, or anybody, or maybe the socket doesn't have a microcontroller, it is driven off a microprocessor or a FPGA or some sort of SoC, we still want to be able to win analog in those sockets, rather it's a – for power management or convertors or have some Wi-Fi on it or have some supervisory op amps or some other things. So right now I think as we look across, we have victory in every area. We are winning around our microcontroller, we're winning around Atmel's microcontroller and we're winning around other people's microcontrollers, SoC, FPGA, processors, et cetera, and there is no specific focus to be one way or the other. We actually have identified a built-in large opportunity to attach analog around Atmel's microcontrollers because those were the sockets we were purposely kept out. Any of the reference designs that Atmel produced before, by design they would put anybody else in it but Microchip. In the last one year, all those reference designs, tools, development tools, et cetera, they've all been refurbished to replace anybody's analog and Wi-Fi with Microchip's. So there you have incremental additive analog that we should be able to attach. And we are. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks for the insight, Steve. Operator For our next question, we'll go to Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Robert Mertens - Needham & Co. LLC Hi. This is Robert Mertens on behalf of Rajvindra. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. You broke out the revenue breakdown by end market. You had about 25% in the automotive end market and you mentioned that this was around the eighth largest semi supplier. Do you have any visibility towards what areas of automotive you're seeing your products go into, if there's strength in infotainment versus ADAS or power management? Or any granularity there would be great. Thank you. Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. We are in a broad range of applications, but we have some specific ones we have a larger exposure to – so you mentioned infotainment. But I'd broaden that to networking inside the car as one area. We are in many access control applications in the car. We are in touch control for a range of both touch screen and touch buttons and things. We're in many USB connectivity inside the car. We're in all the garage door openers inside the car. So it's a pretty broad set of applications and with some specific areas in which we have a much higher penetration than even normal. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. I think we have 51 chips in a Mercedes S-Class car, 55 in a Hyundai Genesis. It's everywhere, up and down the car. So, it's much more broader than anybody can describe. Robert Mertens - Needham & Co. LLC Okay. And then in terms of I guess products going from the high end S-class to Hyundai Genesis and going more mid-market, are you seeing that be a trend that's taking off now or still a quarter or so out? Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Well, those trends don't happen in a quarter. If you look at the keyless entry, where you don't need the mechanical key anymore, began nearly 20 years ago from General Motor (sic) [General Motors] cars. I think we put the first keyless entry where you don't have to use a mechanical key to open the car. We did the first hotel room door lock years ago. Before that, there used to be mechanical keys that even opened the hotel room door lock. And as you have seen over the years, people don't even know there's a mechanical key exists for hotel rooms or cars and stuff like that. So these changes are a lot slower, happen over time. These are not one quarter phenomena. There are 400 different car models that have the HomeLink on it, all-exclusive product of Microchip. There are many hundreds of models that have our MOST bus. There are a large number of models that have our touch in it, and so on and so forth. They all start at the high level and, every year in the following model year, the company will take it down to the middle-range models. And a few years from now, it could get to the lower-end models. Feature-by-feature they migrate down, but the trend doesn't change as much quarter-to-quarter. Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. I think the way to think about it is we have a high presence in all car segments; it's not just at the high end that we are present. That was just an example to show you in a rich environment of electronics, we have a pretty high percentage. But if you look at the lower-end cars, we have just as high a percentage in many of those cars. Robert Mertens - Needham & Co. LLC Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator We'll go now to Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna Financial Group. Liz Pate - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Hi, guys. This is Liz Pate in for Chris Rolland. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just a quick one on the pricing environment. Maybe you can talk about how that is currently industry-wide, and specifically on the Atmel products. Do you still have some ability to raise prices on those products? And thanks. Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc. So we've been talking about it for multiple quarters. It's taken us time to implement the price changes across a broad range of customers. Some of them have been phased-in over time so that they don't all come together in one quarter. But I would say, at this point in time, a substantial portion of the price increases that we've began last June or so are in place. And as we go in – going forward, it's really no programmed increases in prices. What we have done is also put in a significant discipline on new designs, because what we were doing with the price increases was correcting past issues where pricing was done poorly. And those new designs are all being done using a more disciplined process to make sure that we don't have to come back and change the pricing out in time. But pricing for our market tends to be something that it happens at the point of a design-in, and so that's when the competition for what the best performance price-value equation is. And then that happens a year or two before designs usually go into production and there isn't as much pricing discussion that takes place once the designs have been completed and production is getting started. Liz Pate - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Okay. Thanks. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. I want to add, though, that to extend what Ganesh said, that as all the new quotes we are making, really in the last year, have all substantially better disciplined pricing than the average pricing we are having on Atmel parts today, as these designs are going to production, it has been about a year now. So designs are starting to go to production on those things that we quoted on our clock. There will be a steady stream of wind on the back where every quarter the mix gets richer and richer with higher and higher percentage of pricing to be better disciplined pricing coming from Microchip and smaller and smaller percentage of older devices on which we raised the price, but we couldn't raise it all the way to where the new prices are. So this would be a long-term tailwind that will continue to blow in the back. Liz Pate - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Perfect. Thanks. And congrats on the quarter. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Thanks. Operator We'll go now to Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on your execution. The first question is a gross margin question maybe most appropriate for Eric. I believe the company was expecting to see the benefit of the Micrel San Jose fab shutdown in the first part of the calendar quarter. Is that in fact happening? And, if so, is it more in the calendar first quarter, calendar second quarter or more evenly distributed? J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc. So I would say the benefits from the Micrel shutdown have been coming over time. We still probably have a couple of quarters to go as we sell through all the older inventory and all the 8-inch inventory starts to be realized in the cost of sales. So we have got benefits from that the last two quarters, but expect that to continue on in the June and September quarters also. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Thanks, Eric. And then the follow-up question is for Steve. And, Steve, it goes back to a comment that I think you made a few calls ago, when you indicated that, if industry were to grow, I think the number was high-single digits or 10%, I don't recall specifically, that that would favor vertically integrated manufacturers. So my question is this. With demand strong, with the global economy showing signs of improvement and with what appears to have been a five-year period of fairly disappointing analog CapEx, are you seeing signs in your business where the environment is favoring a vertically integrated manufacturer, like Microchip? And, if not, do you think that will occur later this year, or is that something that would be further into the future? Thank you. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Well, I think it is happening already. You are seeing it on our results and you will see it in our results in the coming quarters also. If Atmel was a standalone company today, they wouldn't be able to take advantage of these tremendous improvements we're making on assembly test technology inside capacity being able to bring large volumes on our test technology already running in our Thailand facility producing 5x higher output per system. Subcontractors have no incentive to give you that kind of output. They get paid by the hour on the test system. So if you dramatically improve output and output goes up 5x and now you only have to pay them for 20% of the hours, they're not happy. So there the incentives are not aligned properly. You're seeing tremendous benefit of our vertical manufacturing, both from fab, probe, assembly and tests already and you will continue to see it as we go forward. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Very helpful. Thank you. Operator That does conclude today's question and answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back to Mr. Steve Sanghi for any final remarks. Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc. Well, thank you, everybody. We are pleased to deliver an outstanding quarter and an outstanding fiscal year. And watch us grow, hopefully we can deliver another one. And we'll see some of you at the conferences we will go to later this quarter. Thank you. Operator This does conclude today's conference.

A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. Sales continue to be challenging in the beverage industry in the first quarter and remain weak. In the first quarter, net sales were $742.1 million, up 9.1% from $680.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. The company achieved record first quarter gross sales of $845.5 million, up 8.8% from $777.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced net sales by approximately $3.7 million in the 2017 first quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 64.8%, as compared to 62.2% for the comparable 2016 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to cost of goods savings, as a result of the AFF transaction, which was partially offset by product mix and certain increases in other costs. Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1% for the 2017 first quarter, as compared to 3.4% in the 2016 first quarter. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.7%, compared to 10.2% in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased sponsorship and endorsement costs and commissions. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 14.4%, as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative costs, excluding distributor termination expenses, as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.8% in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 10.6% for the 2016 first quarter. Payroll expenses were up $13 million, primarily to support the strategic brand that we acquired from Coca-Cola, as well as the launches in China and other countries internationally, and stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3.1 million higher. Distributor termination expenses were $19.9 million in the first quarter as compared to $3.4 million in the 2016 first quarter. Legal expenses related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's product were $1.9 million in the 2017 first quarter as compared to $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter. Our effective tax rate decreased from 35.8% in the 2016 first quarter to 32.8% in the 2017 first quarter primarily due to an increase in profits earned by certain foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than the U.S., as well as an increase in equity compensation deductions. Net income was $178 million in the 2017 first quarter, compared to net income of $163.9 million in the 2016 first quarter, an increase of 8.6%. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from 620.7 million for the first quarter of 2016 to 582 million for the first quarter of 2017, as a result of share buybacks, including the modified Dutch tender auction, which was completed in June 2016. Net income was impacted by the substantial increase in distributor termination expenses previously mentioned above. Diluted earnings per share for the 2017 first quarter increased 15.8% to $0.31 per share from $0.26 in the first quarter of 2016. We estimate that distributor termination expenses in the 2017 first quarter of $19.9 million negatively affected diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 per share after tax. We continue to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers globally. Domestically, we transitioned distribution of Monster Energy Drinks in Wisconsin to Coca-Cola bottlers in early January 2017, in parts of Minnesota including Minneapolis and St. Paul in March 2017, and in a part of North Dakota including Fargo in April 2017. We are also making good progress in the U.S. in non-traditional channels, including food service accounts. In EMEA in the first quarter of 2017, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Nigeria, Oman and smaller countries in EMEA. And in April 2017 we commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottler in Kazakhstan. Further additional launches are planned in the remainder of the second quarter of 2017 in certain countries in Africa and the Middle East. In the first quarter of 2017 we launched distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain countries in the Caribbean. In the second quarter of 2017 we anticipate launching Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in certain other smaller and medium-sized markets in that geographic region. In China during the first quarter of 2017, we continued with launches in Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu. We also extended distribution in the Guangdong province. Further launches are planned in China and in other countries, including a relaunch in India in 2017. We also commenced distribution in Malaysia in the same period. We continue to make progress towards our planned relaunch in India later this year. We are also on track to commence distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan in the second quarter. As a result of the AFF transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2017 first quarter, which were broadly in line with expectations. According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through April 22, 2017, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including energy shots increased by 2.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 1.8% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 10.6%, and sales of Full Throttle decreased 5.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased 5.3%, sales of Rockstar increased by 1.9%, sales of 5-hour decreased 6.4%, and sales of AMP decreased 29.9%. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars increased 2.7% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 1.5% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 12.7%, and Full Throttle sales decreased 2.1%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 5.8%, Rockstar was up 4.6%, 5-hour was down 7.2%, and AMP was down 29.9%. We pointed out that the energy shot category has been slowing for some time. And if we exclude the energy shots, as well as energy coffee and energy protein drinks, where we have experienced production capacity shortages, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales in the convenience and gas channel in dollars, in fact, increased by 4.6% over the same period last year, with sales of Monster increasing by 4.5%. We note that the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks and 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, exclude sales of NOS and Full Throttle 8 packs, which were not yet in the Nielsen system. According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, decreased by 0.4 points over the same period last year to 35%. NOS's share increased 0.4 points to 4.2%, and Full Throttle's share remained the same at 1%. Red Bull's share increased 1 point to 36%, Rockstar's share was up 0.1 of a point to 8%, 5-hour's share was lower by 0.8 of a point at 7.4%, and AMP's share decreased 0.6 of a point to 1.2%. According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended April 22, 2017, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel decreased 6.3% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster were 19.5% lower than the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Doubleshot Energy were 8.6% higher. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for Java Monster, which I will address later in the call. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12-weeks ended April 1, 2017, the energy drink category increased 2% in dollars. Monster sales increased 10% versus a year ago, and market share increased 2.1 share points to 30.5%. Red Bull sales increased 3%, and its market share decreased 0.4 of a point to 35.9%. Rockstar's sales increased 5%, and its market share increased 0.8 points to 19.4%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 27% during the month of March 2017. Monster sales increased 41.1%, and market share in value increased 2.7 points to 26.7% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn decreased 27%. Burn's market share decreased 2.7 points to 3.7%. Red Bull's sales decreased 3.5%, and its market share decreased by 3.7 points to 11.6%. Vive 100's market share increased 4.5 points to 41.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 2.1 points to 7.9%. The transition to the KO bottler system in August 2016 resulted in significantly-wider availability of Monster in the traditional trade channel, mom-and-pop stores in Mexico. According to Nielsen, distribution of Monster grew from 10% in March 2016 to 24% in March 2017 in this channel. This translates to growth in Monster's value share of 9 percentage points versus March 2016 in the traditional channel. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in their chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers for EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI for EMEA vary from country-to-country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ending March 2017, the actual 13-week periods differ, varied by few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 13% to 15.5% in Great Britain, from 9.5% to 10.6% in Belgium, from 9.1% to 11.6% in Norway, from 21.5% to 23.7% in France, from 24.4% to 26.5% in Spain, and from 13% to 16.3% in Germany. According to Nielsen, for the period ending March 2017, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year decline from 6.8% to 5.2% in the Netherlands and from 11.1% to 10.8% in Sweden, although the retail value of sales grew 22.1% in Sweden in the comparable period. For the 13-week period, ending March 2017, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share and value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.3% to 11.6% in the Czech Republic, from 15.8% to 17.7% in South Africa and from 6.9% to 9.7% in Italy. For the 13-week period, ending February 2017, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share and value as compared to the same period last year grew from 7.3% to 9.9% in Ireland. According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece grew in the 13 weeks ended February 2017 from 27.7% last year to 29.1%. According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share and value in Chile increased to 28.4% in March 2017 as compared to 20.5% last year, and after transitioning to the KO bottler system in November 2016, Monster's market share and value in Brazil grew to 7.4% in March 2017 as compared to 2.9% in the same period last year. According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's retail market share and value increased from 17.9% to 24.5% in February 2017 compared to the same period last year. According to INTAGE, Monster's market share and value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 39.9% to 44.2% in March 2017. According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share and value grew from 3.1% to 7.1% in March 2017, and in New Zealand, Monster's market share and value grew from 2.3% to 5.5% for the first quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.5% from $621.7 million to $668.6 million from the comparable period last year. Gross sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.4% from $713.5 million to $766.6 million for the comparable period last year. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $4.7 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $68 million for the first quarter as compared to $58.5 million in the same quarter last year. Net sales for the company's Strategic Brands segment were positively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the Other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.5 million in the 2017 first quarter. There were no sales for the Other segment in the comparable 2016 first quarter. We continue to experience production capacity shortages for our re-torqued (18:03) products, Java Monster and Muscle Monster. To reduce the shortfall, we have commenced manufacturing certain flavors of Java Monster in Europe which will shortly be available to our customers in the U.S. We've also procured additional production in the U.S. which will be coming on stream early in the third quarter of 2017 and will result in additional Java Monster and Muscle Monster volumes being available for distribution to retailers thereafter. As a result, we anticipate that it will still be a number of months before production availability allows us to restore normal supply patterns and fully meet consumer demand that exists for these products. We estimate that net sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12 million as a result of such production capacity shortages. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $190.9 million for the 2017 first quarter compared to $149.1 million in the corresponding quarter in 2016. In local currencies, net sales to customers outside of the U.S. were approximately $3.7 million higher. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 17.7% in dollars, and 21.7% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 50.2% in the same period last year to 50.3% during the quarter. We are pleased with the rollout of certain SKUs in the Ultra range in EMEA markets. In 2017, we added additional SKUs of Ultra across EMEA with the introduction of Ultra Citron, which will be available in 10 additional EMEA markets in 2017. Various SKUs in the Ultra range are now sold in 33 EMEA markets. We're also pleased that Monster continued to perform well and gained market share in Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Ireland, Italy and the Czech Republic. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 58.1% in dollars, and 60.5% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 45.2% in the same period last year to 47.7% during the 2017 first quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 18.8% or 22.3% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 15% or 18.2% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 44.7%, or 50% in local currencies, as compared to the same quarter last year. As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with plans for local production in India with a view towards reentering the market in 2017. In Latin America, including Mexico, the Caribbean, gross sales in the first quarter increased 36.2% in dollars and 34.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the first quarter increased 42.2% in dollars and 41.8% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 41.1% in the same period last year to 48.8% during the 2017 first quarter. Net sales increased in Brazil 396.4% in dollars, or 481.7% in local currency, largely due to the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1, 2016. Net sales in Chile increased 47.6% in dollars, and 59.1% in local currency. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $576.3 million, compared to $377.6 million at December 31, 2016. Short-term investments were $209.4 million, compared to $220.6 million at December 31, 2016. Long-term investments decreased to $0.5 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2016. Accounts receivable increased to $509.5 million at March 31, 2017, from $448.1 million at December 31, 2016. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 54.9 days, compared to 48.2 days at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased to $171.3 million from $162 million at December 31, 2016. Average days of inventory was 59 days at March 31, 2017, compared to 57 days at December 31, 2016. As previously reported, in September 2016 we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in limited convenience stores in certain U.S. markets with encouraging sales per point of distribution. We will be launching a line extension of our Mutant brand family, namely White Lightning, a zero-sugar offering to limited customers initially, followed with a general market launch in July. We remain confident about the potential of this brand. In preparation for the launch of Hydro, we commenced limited deliveries of Hydro products to our bottlers and full service distributors at the end of the quarter and are planning for the launch of Hydro to the general retail trade at the end of this month. Hydro is a non-carbonated, lightly-sweetened energy drink that is packaged in a unique 16.9 oz PET can, the size of which is exclusive to us in the U.S. at this time. We are planning to launch Hydro in a 550 ml PET bottle in the United Kingdom and Ireland during the second quarter of 2017. We expanded distribution of Monster Energy Ultra Violet and launched Full Throttle Orange during the first quarter of 2017. At the end of April 2017 we launched a new Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, which will be followed by launches in 24 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and in South Africa in July. We have a robust innovation pipeline and further launches, such as Mango Loco, a new flavor in our Monster Energy juice family, which is planned for a third quarter 2017 launch, and a new espresso Monster Energy drink in 8 oz slim cans in two flavors planned for launch before year end. April 2017 had one fewer selling day compared with April 2016. We estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 9.5% higher than in April 2016. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis, we estimate April 2017 gross sales to be approximately 10.6% higher than in April 2016. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production, and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. On February 28, 2017, the company's board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program during the first quarter. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. We recognize the reduction in raw material costs of $23.3 million in the first quarter as a result of our acquisition of AFF. North American and international gross margins remain healthy. While the U.S. Nielsen market statistics show that the Energy Drink category slowed in the U.S. towards the end of the 2016 fourth quarter, it appears to have picked up steam through the first quarter. The equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the Energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new product launches. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets and reiterate the growth potential for us in China, one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers in the first quarter and will be transitioning a number of other markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in 2017. I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Hi, good afternoon, Dara. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Rodney, can you give us more detailed thoughts on your trends so far in the cities and where you've launched in China early on. And you've been, for a few months, any update on consumer demand in those markets? And then also, separately, some of the new cities launched more recently and what level is retailer reception you're getting? Thanks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. I think that it really is still very early to tell. We're getting sales that we are comfortable with. It's all right, but they vary from area to area depending on the execution of the bottler, depending on the positioning in the stores and basically, pricing and points of sale. So, we think that it's certainly going to take time to continue. You can't just put stuff – a brand like Monster which is not known on the shelf and expect it to immediately start achieving velocities that are where you'd like it to be. There is a buildup and we're going to go through this buildup over a period of time. So really, it really is premature. We're comfortable with the velocities we're getting and the volumes. We're comfortable with the attention and focus. We're putting a lot of effort behind it. We're building up our own infrastructure and teammates to support the brand, support sampling and in-store execution, and we are seeing good execution from a point of view of our point of sale and things of that nature. And we are quite happy with that. But it really is just premature to talk. We are comfortable with the market. It is a large market, and it will continue. We're right in the middle of the rollouts, as we've indicated. There were a whole new number of regions we introduced. It's probably late because of the Chinese New Year was late February into March. We're planning launches. We've planned launches, and we have launched throughout April. And we continue in May, and then pretty much most of it will be done. So there will be a few more areas to do in June and July, but we think it'll be pretty much done by then. There may be one or two hiccups that we don't anticipate at this point. But it will take time, and it's just a very big market and you've got to be patient with and just build slowly. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp. I think one of the other points about China is that a number of the websites and social media that our consumers are used to elsewhere in the world don't appear in China. So in a sense while we have extremely good exposure for the brand in many, many markets in the world, we don't have that same exposure to the Internet in China. So the build will be a lot harder. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Hi. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. I just wanted to follow up with more like thinking of all the outlets, if you can think about like how your growth was? I mean if you're putting the $12 million back, most likely your sales grew close to 7%? I wanted to just clarify that in the U.S. And if that is a number that we should use? And how is the cadence of the improvement during the quarter? I'm assuming, as most companies, like things have improved for the cadence of the quarter? And if you can tell us roughly how the sellout has been? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Well, let's just deal with the first question. One at a time. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. All right. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. You've got to do your own numbers. We don't report the numbers for the U.S. and break them out. You've seen the Nielsen numbers. If you take the Nielsen numbers and then factor in the negative effect on the production issues we've had and they've really been sort of more identified by – we try to keep the two main SKUs in production and on the shelf. But really what it's done is that most of the other SKUs have been out of production and off-the-shelf, and that has continued. So you've got to really take that into account in looking at the growth of the industry and the growth of Monster in the U.S. We did sort of have probably less innovation hitting in this period than we had last year, sort of the reserve for Red Bull. But again, we've explained on a number of occasions what our innovation is for this year and how it's going to come in later in the year because of timing. So we really think that you guys have got make your own judgment call on how you look at the U.S. and the growth. We don't give guidance on the growth either to U.S. or on a broader basis, but we feel pretty comfortable about the industry. We are seeing growth if you look at the Nielsen numbers, and that's what I was referred to earlier. It was down to almost a negative inconvenience in December, and then it's grown just under 1% in January. It was 1.5% or so, roughly, in February. It was 2.5% or 2.6% in March, and it's actually gone up a little higher in April. So clearly there is a nice trend, but you can see the numbers as well as we can. And we think that that is positive going forward. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC But do you see it tracks well at this point? Nielsen is tracking well your actual volumes? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. I'm not sure I heard the question. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC No. I'm just saying if... Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp. There's a difference between our sales and – the increase in our sales and what we are seeing in Nielsen. So we went through the Nielsen numbers on the call. You saw what our quarterly sales levels were, and then you must make your own assumptions as to what you think the performance was. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. We obviously sell in a lot of the non-major channels and that really accounts for the difference and if you've noticed over the years there always has been some timing differences between Nielsen and our numbers. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Thanks Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Hi, Mark. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. So maybe just to go back to that last question, something that clearly comes up repeatedly in conversations from investors in terms of trying to reconcile the scanner data with your reported results, maybe if you could give us a bit of specifics about change in points of distribution in the untracked channels, just so sort of where they come from, where are they now, and how large as a percent of the business – if you don't want to say specifically, but just sort of broader strokes about how important they're becoming to the business today versus where they've been. I think that might help folks a bit. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Without going into the level of them, we are starting to do more business and have more sales in the non-major channels, for example, food service, specialty accounts, non-food accounts. And those continue to increase. Internet, Amazon, although small, some of them are small, they are increasing at quite a strong rate. And we think that one of the reasons there is possibly some slowdown in the convenience channel is it may be attributable to the broader availability, not only of Monster but in fact of energy drinks, through a number of these non-traditional channels. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay, great. Thank you. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp. So, Mark, maybe I can give you a little bit more color. In the on-premise segment, we continue to see double-digit growth in this channel. So maybe that'll be helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO. Your line is open. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Hi. Good afternoon. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Rodney, two questions. One on China. You talked about the buildup as we go through the next few months, or three months, and expect to be fully done by, latest, summer. When you say that, are you thinking about the ACV build or just the penetration? How are we thinking about it when we say fully implemented there? And then international again... Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Well, let's just start – let's just do it one at a time, guys, please. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Okay. When we say July, we will have launched through all of the business units in the – on the two Coke bottlers, there were three Coke bottlers and, as you are aware, the Coca-Cola owned bottler, they've sold their and refranchised their system. It's been divided effectively between COFCO and Swire. And then there was some interchange of territories between COFCO and Swire so that their own territories are more aligned and more adjacent to each other. So we will have launched by July through the different BUs. There is obviously no instantaneous miraculous listing on all the shelves. We're going to continue to build, because particularly in China, there is a modern trade, which is easier and obviously you pick up listings on that much more quickly. But the very, very bulk – large bulk of the business is still traditional trade. And that means it's got to be built up store-by-store slowly, slowly, one-by-one. So that is going to still take time to get that penetration up. And that is going to be a slow build. As we continue to build, as we continue to gain momentum, as we hopefully increase our velocity, we'll also be increasing our exposure and distribution through the whole system. So that's still going to take some time. There is a distinction between those two. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Got it. That's really helpful. And then I just had a question on the international contribution margins, right? And you talked about gross margins increasing in many markets. How should we think about it? You're getting more and more contribution from international markets. At the operating level also are you seeing margins improve from these markets? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. We are seeing some benefit. We are seeing benefits of scale and also improving our local production. We're continuing to get a number of additional plants online, which is helping us reduce our costs in many markets. And that will continue, because as we continue to build out the international market, we are continuing to go through this process of getting production lower and nearer to these markets. We do have – we'll have that same build in marketing and at G&A spend. But initially in some of the newer markets, we obviously are overspending in our G&A side, particularly payroll, in order to support the launches of brands. And so that will take some time, but as we continue, it will have less and less impact as we get maturer in these markets. But we still do have some large markets. I mean, going through the market in China at the moment, we're continuing to increase our head count quite substantially as we're go into each of these launches in each of these Bus, we have to have representation. When we go into India, we will need more people. So there is a disconnect but it is becoming less impactful, because of that we're seeing we think some better gross margins and better bottom-line margins as we go forward. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Got it. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hi, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Hi. Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC I'd like to understand, I mean, to have a bit more clarification on two buckets of growth for you. So first is international launches. Could you give us an update on the three of the major country launches this year? So India, Pakistan, and Argentina. I understand Nigeria has been down. And the second bucket, of course, is Mutant in the U.S. So would like to understand, I mean, what are the marketing activities you are planning to implement to support same-store sales growth, that seems to be soft for now So if you can give me, I mean, or give us, I mean, a bit on those two things and two buckets of growth that would be great. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Yes. Just looking at those three markets, they're very large markets, but they're smaller markets from a point of view of the energy category, the premium energy category. So, in India, we are – as we've indicated planning to launch. We're also evaluating the possibility of launching Mutant as a sort of an affordable energy drink in that market. Argentina, we are moving forward. We are very close. We've still not finalized packing arrangements, but we're right in the middle of negotiations on that, and hope to be able to finalize that reasonably soon. We are, at the same time, going down the track of actually having our product registered and approved, so that's all happening, so that is again will also be a later launch later this year. With regard to Pakistan, we just – pretty much, I think we're about or we're in the throes of just starting to sell now, but it's a smaller market from a premium energy drink product brand. We think there is a much larger market that we can look at, and again, we're also looking at the possibility of launching Mutant there, also still later this year. So they're sort of slightly different. They're slightly different markets, and we are in the planning stages with them, and in the process, so they're all hopefully going to come through before the end of the year. Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thank you. And on Mutant in the U.S., give us some color on to the marketing activities you are planning to implement to support same-store sales growth that would be great. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Well, we have some planning activities. We have switched certain of our existing Monster properties, which we've had for many years and have done – worked very nicely for Monster, such as the Vans Warped Tour. We've made the Vans Warped Tour pretty much a Mutant property, which will get us a lot of sampling, a lot of exposure in 40-something markets and concerts around the U.S. We've also switched, not completely, but a lot of exposure of Mutant into the Monster Jam Series, which are those big trucks, and that's going to happen for the rest of the year. We are going to do in-store price promotions. We're doing sampling, extensive sampling promotions as well for Mutant, and that's all starting to kick in now starting in May and June, the promotions and, as I've said, the sampling activities. We also indicated that we had started with certain limited retailers. We're actually starting some distribution of basically our new zero-calorie White Lightning Mutant drink, which will then give us a better positioning on shelf, and give us alternative offerings, full calorie, and sugar and zero, and that will be probably in the general market by beginning of July. So those two things together we believe with a much broader rollout now. We've opened the market. The number of accounts we're going to in the channels. We are expanding that at the same time now and getting listings. So again, by the time we get to summer midyear, we think that we will have much better distribution for Mutant. Operator Thank you. This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad, and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We're also particularly excited about the new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you all may disconnect.

Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Hi, good afternoon, Dara. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Rodney, can you give us more detailed thoughts on your trends so far in the cities and where you've launched in China early on. And you've been, for a few months, any update on consumer demand in those markets? And then also, separately, some of the new cities launched more recently and what level is retailer reception you're getting? Thanks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. I think that it really is still very early to tell. We're getting sales that we are comfortable with. It's all right, but they vary from area to area depending on the execution of the bottler, depending on the positioning in the stores and basically, pricing and points of sale. So, we think that it's certainly going to take time to continue. You can't just put stuff – a brand like Monster which is not known on the shelf and expect it to immediately start achieving velocities that are where you'd like it to be. There is a buildup and we're going to go through this buildup over a period of time. So really, it really is premature. We're comfortable with the velocities we're getting and the volumes. We're comfortable with the attention and focus. We're putting a lot of effort behind it. We're building up our own infrastructure and teammates to support the brand, support sampling and in-store execution, and we are seeing good execution from a point of view of our point of sale and things of that nature. And we are quite happy with that. But it really is just premature to talk. We are comfortable with the market. It is a large market, and it will continue. We're right in the middle of the rollouts, as we've indicated. There were a whole new number of regions we introduced. It's probably late because of the Chinese New Year was late February into March. We're planning launches. We've planned launches, and we have launched throughout April. And we continue in May, and then pretty much most of it will be done. So there will be a few more areas to do in June and July, but we think it'll be pretty much done by then. There may be one or two hiccups that we don't anticipate at this point. But it will take time, and it's just a very big market and you've got to be patient with and just build slowly. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp. I think one of the other points about China is that a number of the websites and social media that our consumers are used to elsewhere in the world don't appear in China. So in a sense while we have extremely good exposure for the brand in many, many markets in the world, we don't have that same exposure to the Internet in China. So the build will be a lot harder. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Hi. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. I just wanted to follow up with more like thinking of all the outlets, if you can think about like how your growth was? I mean if you're putting the $12 million back, most likely your sales grew close to 7%? I wanted to just clarify that in the U.S. And if that is a number that we should use? And how is the cadence of the improvement during the quarter? I'm assuming, as most companies, like things have improved for the cadence of the quarter? And if you can tell us roughly how the sellout has been? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Well, let's just deal with the first question. One at a time. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. All right. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. You've got to do your own numbers. We don't report the numbers for the U.S. and break them out. You've seen the Nielsen numbers. If you take the Nielsen numbers and then factor in the negative effect on the production issues we've had and they've really been sort of more identified by – we try to keep the two main SKUs in production and on the shelf. But really what it's done is that most of the other SKUs have been out of production and off-the-shelf, and that has continued. So you've got to really take that into account in looking at the growth of the industry and the growth of Monster in the U.S. We did sort of have probably less innovation hitting in this period than we had last year, sort of the reserve for Red Bull. But again, we've explained on a number of occasions what our innovation is for this year and how it's going to come in later in the year because of timing. So we really think that you guys have got make your own judgment call on how you look at the U.S. and the growth. We don't give guidance on the growth either to U.S. or on a broader basis, but we feel pretty comfortable about the industry. We are seeing growth if you look at the Nielsen numbers, and that's what I was referred to earlier. It was down to almost a negative inconvenience in December, and then it's grown just under 1% in January. It was 1.5% or so, roughly, in February. It was 2.5% or 2.6% in March, and it's actually gone up a little higher in April. So clearly there is a nice trend, but you can see the numbers as well as we can. And we think that that is positive going forward. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC But do you see it tracks well at this point? Nielsen is tracking well your actual volumes? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. I'm not sure I heard the question. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC No. I'm just saying if... Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp. There's a difference between our sales and – the increase in our sales and what we are seeing in Nielsen. So we went through the Nielsen numbers on the call. You saw what our quarterly sales levels were, and then you must make your own assumptions as to what you think the performance was. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. We obviously sell in a lot of the non-major channels and that really accounts for the difference and if you've noticed over the years there always has been some timing differences between Nielsen and our numbers. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Thanks Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Hi, Mark. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. So maybe just to go back to that last question, something that clearly comes up repeatedly in conversations from investors in terms of trying to reconcile the scanner data with your reported results, maybe if you could give us a bit of specifics about change in points of distribution in the untracked channels, just so sort of where they come from, where are they now, and how large as a percent of the business – if you don't want to say specifically, but just sort of broader strokes about how important they're becoming to the business today versus where they've been. I think that might help folks a bit. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Without going into the level of them, we are starting to do more business and have more sales in the non-major channels, for example, food service, specialty accounts, non-food accounts. And those continue to increase. Internet, Amazon, although small, some of them are small, they are increasing at quite a strong rate. And we think that one of the reasons there is possibly some slowdown in the convenience channel is it may be attributable to the broader availability, not only of Monster but in fact of energy drinks, through a number of these non-traditional channels. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay, great. Thank you. Hilton H. Schlosberg - Monster Beverage Corp. So, Mark, maybe I can give you a little bit more color. In the on-premise segment, we continue to see double-digit growth in this channel. So maybe that'll be helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO. Your line is open. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Hi. Good afternoon. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Rodney, two questions. One on China. You talked about the buildup as we go through the next few months, or three months, and expect to be fully done by, latest, summer. When you say that, are you thinking about the ACV build or just the penetration? How are we thinking about it when we say fully implemented there? And then international again... Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Well, let's just start – let's just do it one at a time, guys, please. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Okay. When we say July, we will have launched through all of the business units in the – on the two Coke bottlers, there were three Coke bottlers and, as you are aware, the Coca-Cola owned bottler, they've sold their and refranchised their system. It's been divided effectively between COFCO and Swire. And then there was some interchange of territories between COFCO and Swire so that their own territories are more aligned and more adjacent to each other. So we will have launched by July through the different BUs. There is obviously no instantaneous miraculous listing on all the shelves. We're going to continue to build, because particularly in China, there is a modern trade, which is easier and obviously you pick up listings on that much more quickly. But the very, very bulk – large bulk of the business is still traditional trade. And that means it's got to be built up store-by-store slowly, slowly, one-by-one. So that is going to still take time to get that penetration up. And that is going to be a slow build. As we continue to build, as we continue to gain momentum, as we hopefully increase our velocity, we'll also be increasing our exposure and distribution through the whole system. So that's still going to take some time. There is a distinction between those two. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Got it. That's really helpful. And then I just had a question on the international contribution margins, right? And you talked about gross margins increasing in many markets. How should we think about it? You're getting more and more contribution from international markets. At the operating level also are you seeing margins improve from these markets? Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. We are seeing some benefit. We are seeing benefits of scale and also improving our local production. We're continuing to get a number of additional plants online, which is helping us reduce our costs in many markets. And that will continue, because as we continue to build out the international market, we are continuing to go through this process of getting production lower and nearer to these markets. We do have – we'll have that same build in marketing and at G&A spend. But initially in some of the newer markets, we obviously are overspending in our G&A side, particularly payroll, in order to support the launches of brands. And so that will take some time, but as we continue, it will have less and less impact as we get maturer in these markets. But we still do have some large markets. I mean, going through the market in China at the moment, we're continuing to increase our head count quite substantially as we're go into each of these launches in each of these Bus, we have to have representation. When we go into India, we will need more people. So there is a disconnect but it is becoming less impactful, because of that we're seeing we think some better gross margins and better bottom-line margins as we go forward. Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Got it. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hi, guys. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Hi. Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC I'd like to understand, I mean, to have a bit more clarification on two buckets of growth for you. So first is international launches. Could you give us an update on the three of the major country launches this year? So India, Pakistan, and Argentina. I understand Nigeria has been down. And the second bucket, of course, is Mutant in the U.S. So would like to understand, I mean, what are the marketing activities you are planning to implement to support same-store sales growth, that seems to be soft for now So if you can give me, I mean, or give us, I mean, a bit on those two things and two buckets of growth that would be great. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Yes. Just looking at those three markets, they're very large markets, but they're smaller markets from a point of view of the energy category, the premium energy category. So, in India, we are – as we've indicated planning to launch. We're also evaluating the possibility of launching Mutant as a sort of an affordable energy drink in that market. Argentina, we are moving forward. We are very close. We've still not finalized packing arrangements, but we're right in the middle of negotiations on that, and hope to be able to finalize that reasonably soon. We are, at the same time, going down the track of actually having our product registered and approved, so that's all happening, so that is again will also be a later launch later this year. With regard to Pakistan, we just – pretty much, I think we're about or we're in the throes of just starting to sell now, but it's a smaller market from a premium energy drink product brand. We think there is a much larger market that we can look at, and again, we're also looking at the possibility of launching Mutant there, also still later this year. So they're sort of slightly different. They're slightly different markets, and we are in the planning stages with them, and in the process, so they're all hopefully going to come through before the end of the year. Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thank you. And on Mutant in the U.S., give us some color on to the marketing activities you are planning to implement to support same-store sales growth that would be great. Thank you. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. Well, we have some planning activities. We have switched certain of our existing Monster properties, which we've had for many years and have done – worked very nicely for Monster, such as the Vans Warped Tour. We've made the Vans Warped Tour pretty much a Mutant property, which will get us a lot of sampling, a lot of exposure in 40-something markets and concerts around the U.S. We've also switched, not completely, but a lot of exposure of Mutant into the Monster Jam Series, which are those big trucks, and that's going to happen for the rest of the year. We are going to do in-store price promotions. We're doing sampling, extensive sampling promotions as well for Mutant, and that's all starting to kick in now starting in May and June, the promotions and, as I've said, the sampling activities. We also indicated that we had started with certain limited retailers. We're actually starting some distribution of basically our new zero-calorie White Lightning Mutant drink, which will then give us a better positioning on shelf, and give us alternative offerings, full calorie, and sugar and zero, and that will be probably in the general market by beginning of July. So those two things together we believe with a much broader rollout now. We've opened the market. The number of accounts we're going to in the channels. We are expanding that at the same time now and getting listings. So again, by the time we get to summer midyear, we think that we will have much better distribution for Mutant. Operator Thank you. This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks. Rodney Cyril Sacks - Monster Beverage Corp. On behalf of Monster, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad, and in particular to expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottling system internationally. We're also particularly excited about the new opportunities that we have going forward with a portfolio of energy products throughout the world comprised of our Monster Energy brand, together with the strategic brands, as well as Mutant. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you all may disconnect.

And welcome to the First Quarter 2018 Marvell Technology Group Ltd, Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instruction]. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Peter Andrew, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Peter Andrew Thank you very much, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to Marvell's first quarter of fiscal year 2018 earnings call. Joining me on the call today is Marvell's President and CEO Matt Murphy; and CFO, Jean Hu. Before I turn the call over to Matt, I want to remind everyone that comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings release which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our Web site, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will make references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available on our Web site in the Investor Relations section. With that, let me turn the call over to Marvell's President and CEO, Matt Murphy. Matt Murphy Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon to, everyone on the call. As I have stated before, Marvell's goal is to deliver semi-conductor solution that move data faster and more reliably than anyone else. Last month, we took another big step towards achieving this goal with the hiring of Neil Kim as our new Chief Technology Officer. And before I review our Q1 results, I want to share some of his background. Neil spent 16 years at Broadcom where he lead IT development, process node roadmaps and engineering execution. He was instrumental to their success. He built their central engineering organization from the ground up. This was considered to be one of the key assets of Broadcom giving them tremendous leverage in R&D as they scale. Here at Marvell, we have an opportunity to improve our engineering efficiency and output and we are fortunate to have Neil on Board. Neil also brings extensive product development experience from his time at Western Digital where he led the engineering organization, hit the ground running and established himself for the catalytic force in our global engineering community. And we expect this team will both improve execution and accelerate development of new technology. Now, let me turn to our Q1 results. The power of Marvell’s new business model helps us generate strong and what is typically our seasonally slow quarter. In Q1 revenue exceeded the midpoint of our guidance and represented 12% year-over-year increase. Our core businesses of storage, networking and connectivity grew 15% year-over-year and now account for 90% of our total sales. This is the third consecutive quarter in which our core businesses grew year-over-year. Our new business model also generated impressive gross margins. In the first quarter, our non-GAAP gross margin rose about 60%, exceeding our 59% forecast and moving us out into the long term range we outlined at our Investor Day. This is an important milestone for the Company, a gross margin level Marvell has not achieved since fiscal 2011. Our improvement in gross margin is the result of a number of changes we have made throughout the Company; strong execution on cost reduction initiatives; yield improvements driven by product and test engineering; better discipline in selling the value of our solutions; exiting non-core lower margin businesses; improved mix within our segments; and the ramp of new products with higher margins. We also significantly improved our non-GAAP operating margin to 21.8%, exceeding our guidance of 20%. This represents an important step towards our long term goal of 30% operating margin. Our revenue growth and operating performance translated into strong free cash flow of $117 million or 20% of sales. I'm also pleased that we returned $196 million to shareholders or roughly 170% of our free cash flow during the past quarter. I'm very pleased with Marvell's financial performance in Q1. Now, turning to our business performance. In Q1, our storage business performed much better than typical seasonality and grew 25% year-over-year. Our SSD revenue grew by double digits sequentially and by triple digit year-over-year. This growth reflects our increased market presence in both the SSD client and enterprise and data center markets. Our success in this market is a direct result of our technology leadership and strong partnerships with tier one customers. We are well positioned that this market continues to grow, and expect it to represent 25% [ph] of our total storage revenue in the second half of fiscal year 2018. In HDD, we experienced very strong growth in the enterprise and data center markets even as our client business declined sequentially. We have assembled the industry of broadest portfolio of SSD and HDD solutions and continue to shift our higher gross revenue segments of the storage market. An example of this shift can be seen in our total enterprise and data center revenue, which more doubled from a year ago and grew 40% sequentially from the fourth quarter. We are pleased with the performance of our storage business and are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity in this large and growing market. Moving to networking. This business performed well in Q1. Revenue was up 5% from a year ago, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. What is even more encouraging is that our switching PHY and SoC products grew double digits year-over-year. As you may remember from our Investor Day, we highlighted our refresh product line in the 25 new products introduced in the last 18 months. I'm pleased to say that we are gaining great traction with our switch and PHY products, targeting 2.55 and 10 gigabit Ethernet market. Marvell's success to-date has been providing switch PHY and SoC solutions for the enterprise campus and SMB market. What is new this quarter is that we’ve been successful in extending design win momentum with our 10 gig solutions into the carrier market for 5G base stations. Our solutions are winning in this market because our products offer both greater port density and the latest software feature set. This enables our solutions to be more flexible and configurable within our customers’ products. Our connectivity business performed better than expected in Q1 with revenue up 3% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, or seasonality and the specific timing of certain customer ramps make this business a bit uneven, revenue growth from Q4 to Q1 was driven by wins in gaming and home media streaming applications. Finally, on the end market adjacencies that we discussed at Investor Day, Marvell has secure multiple design wins in Q1 for our automotive Ethernet and WiFi products with U.S., European and Asian car manufacturers. While these wins are not projected to deliver meaningful revenue until fiscal 2019 and beyond, they do represent an important milestone in Marvell's progress in the automotive market. In summary, it was another solid quarter for Marvell and I want to give credit where credit is due. Our success would not have been possible without the extraordinary efforts of Marvell's employees. I have been so impressed by their contributions and by the speed of which they have work to get the Company back on track. In virtually every Company meeting, employee round table and all way conversation, I reminded we have some of the best talent in the industry and are greatful to all them for their hard work. With that, I’ll turn the call over to our CFO, Jean Hu. Jean Hu Thank you, Matt. I’ll discuss the highlights for our first quarter for fiscal 2018 and provide our current outlook for continuing operations in the second quarter for fiscal 2018. Our total revenue in first quarter was $579 million. Our car business grow 15% year-over-year and was flat sequentially much better than typical seasonality. In Q1, we had a small one-time benefit of $4.7 million in revenue from reduction in revenue related accrual. Storage accounted for 52% of our revenue and grew strongly on year-over-year basis. As a reminder, we did have a weak Q1 2017 in storage revenue. On sequential basis, it was much stronger than typical seasonality. This strength was driven by the significant ramp of our overall SSD revenue and the growth in HDD underpriced and the data center market, as Matt mentioned earlier, offset by softer than expected HDD client revenue. Network accounted for 25% of our revenue and grew 5% year-over-year in line with our expectations. Connectivity accounted for 13% of our revenue and grew 3% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Other products accounted for 10% of Q1 revenue, and declined 16% year-over-year, less than we expected as we benefited from some last time buy activity. Our GAAP gross margin for Q1 was 60.2% and our non-GAAP growth margin was 60.4%, above our expectation of approximately 59%. This is an important milestone for Marvell as we are now within our targeted non-GAAP growth margin range as we said at our Investor Day. Please note that our Q1 gross margin also slightly benefited from the accrual reduction noted above. However, excluding this benefit, we are still above about 60% non-GAAP growth margin. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were in line with our guidance range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin was 17.1% and 21.8% respectively, better than expected. We are pleased with the result and expect to continue to make progress toward our target of approximately 30% operating margin. Our first quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.19 and our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.24, compared to $0.03 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This improvement demonstrated a strong financial leverage of our new business model. Please note that our Q1 fiscal 2018 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS also included approximately $0.01 per diluted share benefit from the accrued reduction noted above. Free cash flow in the quarter was $117 million and represented about 20% of the sales. We returned about 170% of our free cash flow to shareholders, which includes $30 million in dividend and $166 million in stock re-purchases. Let’s now turn to our balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, our cash and marketable securities were $1.65 billion or roughly $3.50 per non-GAAP diluted share. Before I provide our Q2 guidance, I am very pleased to report we closed the sale of our LTE thin-modem product line for a purchase price of $45 million on May 17. This product line was classified as part of our other products and category at approximately 5 million in corporate revenue and the gross margin below the corporate average. This divesture was not included in our previously announced discontinued operations. Our original plan was to access the LTE product line through restructuring actions. In Q2, this product line will be classified and added to discontinue operations. Please note our revenue of guidance for Q2 excludes revenue associated with the sale, which had been approximately 5 million for project. Now, turning to Q2 fiscal 2018 guidance. We expect our total revenue from continuing operations to be in the range of $585 million to $615 million. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect our storage revenue to be flat sequentially and to grow double digit year-over-year. We expect our net working revenue to be approximately flat sequentially. As we said last quarter, we will continue to see the headwinds from the decline of the legacy product line but we do expect the new products ramp to offset the likely decline in the second half of this fiscal year, enabling networking to return to growth. We expect our connectivity revenue to grow more than 30% sequentially and double digit year-over-year, primarily due to a seasonal customer demand in gaining and the growth of our high performance connectivity solutions. At the middle point of our guidance, we expect our car business over storage networking and the connectivity to grow approximately 5% sequentially and year-over-year. We expect our other product categories to decline high single digit sequentially in the second quarter, and represent approximately 8% of our total revenue. As we discussed during our Investor Day, other products to provide a slight headwind to our total revenue growth. But we do expect these products to have a long revenue tail and generate sustained cash flow for the Company. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP growth margin to be approximately 61%; we expect our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $237 million and $247 million; and the non-GAAP operating expenses to be between $215 million and $220 million. Our restructuring plan remains on track. At the middle points of the guidance, we expect to achieve 25% non-GAAP operating margin, making another positive step toward our long term target business model. We anticipate the GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.21 to $0.27 and the non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.26 to $0.30. With that, we’ll now open the line to Q&A. Operator, take the first question. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri from Cowen and Company, your question please. Tim Arcuri I guess the first question, you talked about some new 10 g was the working. Can you just talk little more about that? Matt Murphy So what we really said in my prepared remarks was one reinforce the messages from Investor Day, which was really that we saw a market transition happening in the enterprise campus, in SMB markets starting now and over the next couple of years, transition to 2.5, 5 and 10 gig deployments. What we said also though that was incremental was that the same solutions for 10 gig that we targeted and we have been successful in in the enterprise areas we are also now getting design wins across several customers and platforms in 5G base station. And so that was encouraging, and I think it speaks to the quality of the product definitions in the engineering and also I would say our improved sales efforts here at Marvell to broaden the set of accounts and customers that we call on and promoting our solutions. So we just highlighted the 10 gig as an incremental opportunity for us in carrier, which we had not talked about in the Investor Day. Tim Arcuri And then Jean, the gross margins obviously is very, very strong, it dropped to almost double the revenue year-over-year o some of that cost cutting that. But some of things that I am excited, and I think you talked about as well. Some of the things seem to have long legs to them. So it seems like with what you’ve already done that there is more legs to gross margin, and then there is more you can do. So I guess my question is, is that the right way to think about it that some of the things do have longer legs here, and then is it reasonable to -- I know maybe you don’t want to commit to 65, I know that we’re sort of pushing you on this. But is that an unreasonable number over the longer team? Thank you. Jean Hu Yes, so I’ll give you some color, but Matt can add more about longer term on gross margin, right. When you look at the gross margin improvement, Matt talked about all the different efforts that we have been making. So when we look at the year-over-year gross margin improvement, really half of them are coming from cost reduction initiatives that Matt had talked about. The other half largely comes from product mix change and just managing our business and operation. So we are very pleased with the margin we achieved because we saw during our Analyst Day, we’ll get here sometime in the first half. So we’re really pleased we actually achieved it earlier. The guidance of 51% in Q2 largely reflects our thinking this is the run rate of gross margin, and those costs were not going to stop here. Matt, anything you… Matt Murphy Sure, maybe I'll add a few comments since I think this will be one of the bigger questions from investors and folks on the phone. So just add to what Jean said, as mostly I think recall when we started this journey from the beginning myself as well the rest of the management team really adopted a mind set and a mentality here as Marvell that really put gross margin as one of the key performance indicators of the Company. We have multiple reasons why we believe that’s important. One of those is that we believe it’s a reflection of the quality of the revenue and the quality of the engineering in the Company. And quite frankly, I don’t think any of us were satisfied at the level of the gross margin that Marvell is delivering in the past. So we made it a priority. But I have also said that there is really been no silver bullet on how we got here. There has been tremendous effort that’s happened, as Jean mentioned, on the operational side with working more closely with our suppliers; better negotiations practices; certainly focusing on things like things like yield; really I think our product and test engineering team has done a great job. Also, I think the benefits of our portfolio management that we did and obviously driving better mix and then being fortunate and having new products ramp, the number of factors it doesn’t stop here. We’re going to continue to put one foot in front of the other and do what we should be doing, which is good general management blocking and tackling. We’re not planning on upping our gross margin range at this point. But certainly, we have continued to make improvements against our internally set targets since we got here. And we’re encouraged by what we see, including the guide that we gave in Q1, which you could also argue have a little bit of mix working against this actually. So we’re not commenting beyond Q2, but it continues to be priority. And I think it's really a reflection of the value that’s actually inside Marvell as we have been fortunate to be part of actually unlocking that over the last nine to 10 months. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line John Pitzer from Credit Suisse, your question please. John Pitzer Matt, I guess, given that storage was so much stronger than seasonal in the April quarter. It’s pretty impressive that you guys guiding sequentially flat. I was hoping like you did for April, you might be able to give us a little bit color on the July guide as to how you think SSD versus HDD is doing in the quarter, and I guess even with the HDD client versus enterprise? And I asked the question because there seems to be a lot of investor confirmation that the HDD side of the business has been unusually strong over the last two quarters. And as that rolls off it’s going to be hard for you guys to teaching to grow. And I just want to get your comments on your SSD growth opportunities and your share growth within HDD and enterprise and data center? Matt Murphy I would say first it's at the highest level. We’ve been very encouraged by our progress in the overall storage market. I’d say agnostic stage to SSD with respect to the solutions that we’re delivering and now shipping into the end markets of enterprise and data center, and I think that’s a very positive mix shift for the Company that’s been ongoing since I got here. So between HDD and SSD, as we called out, we had very strong sequential growth into Q1 from Q4. And really what I would say on Q2 is we see that momentum continuing across both SSD and HDD for our solutions that go into the enterprise and data center. On the comment about HDDs running harder, I think that’s been almost the case since I got here. It seems like every quarter sort of keeps doing better from an industry point of view than people think. So we clearly keep our eye on that with respect to what our customers are up to and inventory levels. But we also react to, at the end of the day, we plan our business around what our customers need and that’s reflected in our guide. So I guess what I just again reiterate overall is we’re real positive on our storage business, both in HDD and SSD and I think the mix shift that we are seeing away from traditional PC client type of applications, enterprise an data centers very positive on our goal, whether it's SSD or HDD. John Pitzer And then may be as a follow up, Jean, given just all the moving parts in the revenue model now, it might be helpful if you can spend just a few minutes trying to level set as to how we should think about seasonality beyond July quarter, and what are the puts and takes on that? Jean Hu I think that’s something we have been looking at inside the Company. If you look at in the past, our business has changed a lot. So when we look at the seasonality frankly networking tends to be less seasonal. So if you look at our guidance for the Q2, it's really flat sequentially. In the second half, I think our view is actually because the new product cycle we have with all those 25 new products, we do see those products start to ramp up offset the legacy headwinds we set. So for networking that’s how we think about for the rest of the year. For the storage really, I think again the normal seasonality really that’s not we haven't seen played out this year. So it's difficult for us to call any normal seasonality going forward. I think as we guided for Q2, Q3 for many of the year the view we have is again like Matt said this on the enterprise data center side we’ll continue to see the expansion of our business for the rest of the year. So we’ll keep you posted about our progress there for sure. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS, your question please. Stephen Chin The first one I had was just hoping to get some more color on your SSD sales target for the back half of the fiscal year. I think Matt mentioned 25% to 30% of source sales target, and just given that math compared to where you are today, I think it would imply that this can roughly grow in the low to mid-20s figure? Just relative to your end market for the broader SSD market, do you think you can grow faster in the end market, of course to the 30% range and we’re seeing it at 50% today? Matt Murphy Sure, I'll take a stab at that, and I'll let Jean add any color as appropriate. What I would say is we have -- I would go back even to our November call when we decided to start giving more color around our SSD mix, which I believe was favorably received by everybody. And we had a nice progression from 20% above 20% and then now we’re guiding back half of the year in this 25% to 30% range. So you can make -- you can run your model across that spectrum to see the progress. And I think when you do that certainly would indicate that Marvell is growing faster than -- certainly this past quarter has been growing faster than the end market. And we believe that design when pipeline we have and the opportunities we have will get us to where guided. So I wouldn’t argue with that. I think that we’re not going to give exact specific numbers or specific detail percentile breakouts. But again, on the spirit of investor transparency, we’re just trying to show progress and then you can back to cross that against your own model and for gross rate market share change et cetera. But my summary point would be we just continue to feel very good about our position in that particular business as evidenced by the results not only in Q1 but where we see this ending as we head towards the back half of the year. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley, your question please. Craig Ellis I wanted to focus on two longer term questions, first following up on some of the end market commentary. Within the connectivity business, Matt, you mentioned that there were some automotive Ethernet wins that would generate revenue in fiscal '19. Can you quantify to the extent that you’re getting those wins either regionally or across customer set, so we can get a sense of the market penetration you may be already achieving relative to some of the comments you made at Analyst Day? Matt Murphy Sure. So just for clarity to back up one step, I think the way to think about the automotive opportunity and what I said in my prepared remarks was we actually saw design wins and momentum continuing to build in both the connectivity side, which is WiFi, WiFi Bluetooth combo chips for automotive, as well as automotive Ethernet, which includes PHYs as well as our switches with integrated PHYs. So number of different products across two different technologies that fit Marvell has considerable expertise and position. And so the way to think about the traction really, which is I think a very positive sign that I’ve seen is that it’s very broad based in nature in terms of geography that we saw wins across all three major regions. And it’s across multiple customers and OEMs as well. And having been involved with automotive for quite a bit of time, almost 10 years now, going back to 2007 when I got really involved with my old company. This concept of Ethernet in the vehicle was around even then, and what we do see is that, that vision of actually upgrading that legacy box in the car connecting all the desperate ECUs on one packet base network is starting to happen. And so we feel like we’re in a good position as Ethernet becomes more prolific in vehicle. And we’re calling out as an FY'19 and beyond, so we’re not quantifying any revenue yet or sizes. But you can imagine we’ll begin to talk more about that as we make progress towards these production ramps. But I think it's just the signal that we’ve got. We’ve got leverage from our existing R&D efforts that we can apply into adjacent markets that are growing very fast where new Sam is actually being created and we think automotive is one of those markets for us. Craig Ellis The follow up question relates to your commentary regarding Neil Kim's appointment as CTO and the question is this. Given his background at really creating significant extensibility to R&D capabilities and the efficiency implication thereto for Marvell, would you expect that to result in increased new product productivity for the team overtime or would it result in lower operating expense versus what we would have expected prior overtime? And are there gross margin implications given what he’ll be doing with the rest of the team? Thank you. Matt Murphy Sure, happy to comment a little bit more on Neil. So the first backdrop I would give is that we possess an incredibly talented engineering organization here at Marvell. And credit continues to go to the founding team of Marvell and the quality of the people that were brought in over many years and established. So we’ve got a phenomenal base of talent to work with. One thing that -- and it's a very creative and innovative and unique engineering team, I think in the industry. What I have observed since coming in is that there is some opportunity I think to put some more discipline and process and measurements and implement, I call them, more industry leading best known message into our engineering organization. And I think Neil is probably one of the best equipped individuals in the industry to actually bring that in. So with that translation for us right now is really getting more output, i.e. higher new product introduction quantity run rate, faster time to market, fewer spend, all these other benefits. So it's not necessarily a direct OpEx savings; although, I think when you start doing all those things, and you get more efficient, you obviously get benefits. But we’re really trying to more and get the team we’ve got actually to be even more productive. With respect to gross margin, I think, the impact I would just see there is it’s very clear in my history and in this industry and it's probably the view of the investor base as well is there’s a high correlation between the margins you can get on a product and the amount of time that takes to develop the product. So if you are first to market and you can have an advantage there, it has a tremendous lever on your gross margins and your profitability and your market position. And so I think as a side benefit by actually improving our new product cycle times and reducing spends, getting things out faster and more efficiently with higher yields, I think it will have all kinds of longer term benefits as you indicate. And I think he is one piece of the puzzle. There is a tremendous workforce here. But I think already he is influence is being felt and were really happy to have him here. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we do have a full queue this evening, so we ask that you please limit yourselves to one question each. You may get back in the queue as time allows. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from J. P. Morgan, your question please. Harlan Sur Good afternoon and solid job on the execution and the continued margin expansion. In networking, obviously, I know the sweet spot for the team continues to be enterprise campus SMB, good to see the traction with 10 gig and carriers. But for the cloud datacenter guys, it does seem like the transition to 25 gig per quarter is starting to move at a pretty rapid pace. Just wanted to get an update from you guys on the traction with your 25 gig switch solution, which I think you guys call Bobcat 3, I know you guys were showcasing that at OCP. And then maybe an update on some of the PHY solutions that you have that helps your customers leverage the existing 10 gig and 20 gig infrastructure, but still ratchet up to 25 gigabits per channel. So just wanted to understand that the team is already participating in this upgrade cycle? Thank you. Matt Murphy I think I’d just say the update as we did -- actually, first I would confirm all of your statements are accurate. We do have the products you mentioned now introduced and sampling, and in design win mode. And we called them out at the Investor Day, which I think would news to some investors because I think people had always thought we were this enterprise only campus only focused and this was our first foray. And we’ve been very pleased on both of those products that you mentioned, both attraction we see on our 25 gig switches, as well as the physical interface products on re-timers and repeaters. So that continues I think to track well. We don’t -- it's still early days, but you’re absolutely right that that traction in 25 gig across some of our enterprise customers, by the way also, that are moving up in the enterprise class datacenters, as well as the datacenter guys are moving in that direction. And so we’re pleased with the progress so far. But clearly, the Company's goal is to participate in that continued data center build out opportunity, which I think is a large Sam expansion for the entire industry over the next five years. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley, your question please. Joe Moore So on SSD I wonder if you could talk about the mix of enterprise versus client, you see any differences in those two markets. And then also if you could discuss any tightness of NAND supply, did that help you guys or hurt you guys from a share perspective and customer exposure perspective? Thank you. Jean Hu Yes, on the SSD side, what we have seen is our SSD business grow sequentially and year-over-year very significantly. And when we look at our enterprise where property mall index in SSD side to enterprise and the datacenter versus our HDD business, but our overall enterprise data center storage revenue have grown significantly during Q1. And so we’re not going to breakdown into exactly how much of our SSDs enterprise or SSD. But over the remaining of the fiscal year, we definitely will tell you that this is the trend of enterprise in datacenter business, both in HDD and SSD how we’re going to progress for the rest of the year. So on the NAND shortage question, we actually -- we have a strong relationship with our tier one OEM customers. So we are actually less impacted by the shortage. We do see some of our tier two customers get impacted. But overall, if we look at our revenue our top three, four customers, they’re all tier one OEMs. So we don’t see the impact there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Chris Rolland from Susquehanna, your question please. Chris Rolland I can't remember the last and I saw a company with double digit revenue growth, and OpEx down 20% year-on-year, so nice job there. Also, a nice sale on the LTE business as well; perhaps I shouldn’t looking it get towards in the month here. Perhaps you can describe the level of interest you have for any other products outside of the G.hn and LTE businesses that you sold in that 100 million that you could potential sell? And then lastly, since you guys are building your cash ops here perhaps your thoughts on M&A, particularly semi-stocks are up year-on-year so strongly? Matt Murphy So on the first one, which was the LTE sale, we were pleased to get that done. As Jean mentioned, that was not originally part of our discontinued ops because we thought the likely of selling it was low. So we were pleased to accomplish that, because I think; one, it's a good team and it's sound a good home with the company that actually wants to invest in this area; and we got $45 million for it. So I think that was a positive. All I would say is on the remaining discontinued ops, we’re still very much tracking to our plan that we announced back in November in our restructuring when we called out the disc ops. I have no updates on any details within that. But you are right, G.hn was part of it and there is some remaining work to be done there. Your second question was around M&A and our cash balance. And I think we’re in a very good position. We have a lot of flexibility at this point given the fact that we have $1.6 billion in cash and now you have seen what kind of operating income we’re generating that we believe we can generate on a go forward basis. And so that’s one where we continue to obviously look, we also understand where valuations are. So that’s always something that’s going to be a balance. But we’re very committed and I’ll just proactively answer this one for future questions that may come in that we’re going to remain very objective around this trade-off between holding enough of fire power versus returning to shareholders and so that’s the discussion that we continue to have on capital returns. I would say that we’re still early in our journey here at Marvell. We continue to make progress every quarter, and the second is that I think from a capital return point of view, as Jean mentioned, we did returned above the run rate that we had committed back in November. And so we’ve done about $290 million out of the $500 million estimate that we had made for the year. And of course with the dividend, you end with a pretty sizable shareholder return last quarter. So we’re going to continue to monitor both, and just keep one foot in front of the other on running our business. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company, your question please. Quinn Bolton I wanted -- so first on the SSD business. I believe you guys were working on a turnkey solution for the clients and retail side of business. Just wondering if you could give us an update on that? And then just a clarification, I believe you said that the client HDD business is weaker than what you had originally expected when you gave guidance 90 days ago. I am just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color there. What surprised you in that segment of the market? Jean Hu I'll take the HDD question first then Matt can answer the other SSD 10 gig question. So on HDD side, we did see the revenue on client HDD business was softer than we expected. Although, when we gave the guidance largely toward end of the quarter it’s probably as many of you have seen this, there is some inventory views that we suspect that’s related to that. So for us, we don’t see the end customers but certainly, we see the demand, it’s a little bit softer than what we expected. But overall, frankly, HDD market continues to be quite a stable. I would say, I would add on that one, but it’s a softer than we guided in Q4 when we had our earnings call long time ago. Matt Murphy And then I think on the SSD one. So as we have mentioned, there is a comprehensive efforts inside the Company to align various firmware and software efforts to get to a common full period churn key software solution that can actually run across multiple Marvell controllers. Today, we do have solutions for retail and we have code that shifts with that -- those controllers. And we’ve made some progress there. But that code today is not necessarily scalable across the entire Marvell product set. So I think that’s still a work-in-progress in terms of having, I would call, a more comprehensive solution. But clearly in the areas where we have targeted and had some very focused churn key offerings. We have made progress and that’s also been part of the some of the growth that we have had. So we are participating today, just to be clear, across the entire spectrum of SSD opportunities in retail, in client, which would be PC oriented all the way up to we mentioned a few times, I think this exciting opportunity in the data center. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank, your question please. Ross Seymore I want to focus on the OpEx and the operating margin, if I could, with my question. Jean, you guys are on a nice trajectory there in delivering on plan. Are you still committed to hitting that $206 million or the $820 million, $830 million run rate in the October quarter? And then as we look past there to get to that 30% operating margin target that Matt you and Jean talked about. Is that going to be achieved more on the revenue growth, leveraging from that existing level of OpEx? Or are there other absolute levels of OpEx or absolute changes in OpEx that would make that drop from dollar perspective? Jean Hu So on the restructuring side, we’re on track together to the target that we communicated during Investor Day, which is to get it to around between $820 million to $830 million run rate in Q3 of fiscal '18. So we are on track to get to that target. Just as a reminder, our Q4 fiscal '18, we actually will have 14 weeks, so this is whilst the four, five years that you end up catching up with 14 weeks quarter. So if I look at the OpEx model after we achieve our target, I would say, you have to add back that one additional week in Q4. So our operating expense -- we are going to be very disciplined in managing our operating expense going forward. And going back to the model, long term target model, we’re very committed to our 30% operating margin model. As we talked about during the Investor Day, we have the multiple levers, top line revenue growth, gross margin improvements and operating expense efficiency. So when you look at the three levers, we’re going to manage through it, we definitely believe our top line revenue will continue to grow as we communicated to everyone during the Investor Day, then gross margins and other level operating expense will be very disciplined. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley from Benchmark, your question please. Gary Mobley You mentioned in your prepared remarks some last time buyers some benefits from last time buy in the other product category. Is that having some influence on Q2 and can you talk to the magnitude of other revenue impact? Jean Hu Yes, so just a quick recap, it’s under our other product category. It includes a lot of things -- it includes our printer business, which actually is larger portion of that category. But it also includes application processors, some also the legacy product lines we had form the past. So it's a collection of the product lines, some of them we had last time buys. It's probably below 10% of our Q1 fiscal '18 revenue in that particular category. And it always had some last time buy even in Q2 but overall, we actually going to see once we get at fiscal '18 as I talk about during Investor Day. We are actually going to see this product this other category to be more stable, because then it's primarily going to our printer business, which is not growing but actually it's a very stable and flatter business. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie Research, your question please. Srini Pajjuri I have a clarification and a question. Jean, I think you said networking business still has some legacy that’s declining. Just curious as to if you could clarify how big that legacy business is? And then in terms of my question, the connectivity business, I guess you are guiding from 30% sequential. And I understand there is seasonality. I am just trying to figure out to what extent this is normal seasonality versus new design wins? And then how we should think about seasonality beyond Q2 in connectivity? Thank you. Jean Hu Yes, on your first question on the networking side, the legacy product lines, it’s about between 15% to 20% of the revenue of our networking business revenue and those product lines actually have long life, they last four, five years. But during the fiscal '18, as we talked about last two quarter, we see some drop for the last quarter and next few quarters. But after that, as I said in the second half, our new product revenue ramp is going to offset that legacy product decline. And your second question is about wireless connectivity, right. On the wireless connectivity side, more than 30% sequential increase is largely driven by the seasonal demand on the gaming side and the some of the connected home solutions. We are also getting tractions on the enterprise access point and some of the high end of performance connected home solutions. I would say this is more seasonal than regular, because we do see the gaming segment has been quite healthy. Typically, for the wireless connectivity business, you will see this quarter is the highest quarter and then it started to come down. Of course after the holiday season here you are going to see seasonal significant decline of wireless connectivity, because the seasonal -- typical seasonal cycle. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup, your question please. Atif Malik If I look at your segment sales, storage was about $5 million below seed expectations, mobile and networking were in line and most of that side came from the other line; and as you’re gliding to 4% decline year-over-year for revenues. How should we think about your revenue growth year-over-year basis in October and January? And what is going to make the growth revenue accelerate? Is it going to be the new products in the networking side or SSD share? Can you just talk about what's going to cause the year-over-year revenue decline to revert its course? Jean Hu Maybe, I just want to clarify. When you look at our Q2 guidance, at the middle point of our guidance, our storage and networking and connectivity business actually will grow 5% year-over-year. The other category of the products would decline more than 30% year-over-year. So the overall Company at the middle point of our guidance is actually flattish. But our call business is actually growing year-over-year. I think if you think about going forward as we outlined during our Investor Day is we do think our storage business and networking business are going to grow faster than market. And our performance in Q1 is strong validation of that. And our wireless connectivity business is going to grow along the line of the market. That’s how we’re driving the overall business to grow. The other category we said in fiscal '18 is going to decline 30% year-over-year. But beyond of fiscal '18, if you have some slight headwind to our overall revenue growth, but we do believe we’ll be able to grow our overall revenue above the market. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays, your question please. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs, your question please. Mark Delaney The question is on the enterprise hard drive business, if I understood correctly, that part of the hard drive business was better than what have been expected when you gave guidance. You talked a little bit about what's driving the upside in the enterprise market. Do you think you’re seeing acceleration with some of the share gains or the end market strength? And then maybe you can just help us to understand just the breath of programs that you are targeting for share gains within enterprise HDD controllers? Thank you. Matt Murphy So a couple of things, one is the performance that we saw. We did indicate when we guided and as well as at the Investor Day that that particular segment we were pleased to see new ramps occurring in Q1, which were new programs that we haven't participated in before. And then that occurred, which is good and we continue to see progress there. We are not in the business really of doing back and forth on a share gain discussion. I think the way we think of it is the HDD market overall is fairly established; there is two large players; there is finite set of customers; and really we’re focused on obviously a segment of the market in making progress there, which is the capacity oriented near line drive and enterprise drive. And we’ll continue to do that. But we’re not in the business of trying to call out share gains other than we’re saying that we’ve got some new programs that ramp they were higher than last year and we’re pleased with that progress. And so that’s all I am going to say on the HDD enterprise side. I think it's a good opportunity for Marvell to participate, going forward. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy from Stifel, your question please. Kevin Cassidy On your 25 gig switch, can you say what customers you are getting attraction with? Is it the tier two, tier one light backs or any other above? Matt Murphy I think what I would say is we’re not at liberty at this point to do any specific customer disclosers, just because we don’t have that provision. But what I would say is that there is a lot of interest in the products that the interest is across, I would say, the range of those types of accounts. So it's not something that is targeting at like one or two customers. I think there is going to be -- we are hoping broad based adoption for it. But at this point, we’re still pretty early too in securing those lens, and really kind of running the gauntlet on some of the qualifications we need to do. So I think we’ll probably have to table that one for later as we make progress. But when we can, we’re certainly happy to provide more discloser around that. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Vivel Arya from Bank of America, your question please. Vivel Arya I just wanted to maybe go back to one of the prior questions. There have been some concerns about double ordering and component tightness in the supply chain. Matt, I was just wondering what you have seen. Is there any abnormal behavior in terms of demand that could normalize? Or do you really think that the demand environment stays quite strong and the supply environment is quite balanced a bit? Thank you. Matt Murphy Yes, sure happy to answer that question. I think, I am certainly aware of the commentary that’s been out there from a number of suppliers. I think the lot of commentary has come more out of the component or catalog or mix signal type of analog companies. And we’re not really in that business. So we tend to be fairly specific in the SoCs we sell. We sell finite number of products to some very large customers. Distribution is a pretty small percentage of our sales. So from our point of view, we see the lead time environment supply chain all that’s running very normally here at Marvell. Certainly -- but I have been to enough of these cycles to know sometimes you don’t know when you are in them. But certainly having lived through those, it doesn’t feel like at least we have Marvell experiencing that kind of thing. I think we have seen in the supply chain pockets of tightness depending on the particular supply or the particular -- either process node or thing that we need to procure in order to make our products. But that’s really isolated. So I would say for Marvell we’re probably not the canary and the coal mine on that one. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tom Sepenzis from Northland Securities, your question please. Tom Sepenzis You’ve talked about networking and obviously the strong growth that you’re seeing in the connectivity business. Can you talk a little bit about what your expectations are for storage as a whole in the second half of the year? Obviously, SSDs are doing well. But are HDDs causing a little bit of headwind there, should we expect growth in the second half? Matt Murphy So I think we’ll limit our commentary today around our storage outlook really to the SSD one only, and that was really given to again provide a little more transparency around the progress that we’re making there. And also, I think that -- because that’s a growing market and that pipeline I think is pretty well understood, we were comfortable giving those ranges. I think with respect to calling HDD at this point in the second half, we’re really in the business of guiding one quarter at a time. I don’t really know what that’s going to look like. We’re fairly looking at the indicators. But certainly, as we get into the next quarter call and we have some more visibility or when it’s appropriate, we’d be happy to share our views. But we’re not ready to really make a prediction on the second half at this particular juncture. Operator Thank you. And this does conclude the question and answer session of today's program. I would like to hand the program back to Matt Murphy for any further remarks. Matt Murphy Thank you very much. Just a couple words here, in closing, I would like to thank everyone for spending some time with us today to talk about Marvell's Q1 results. We are executing well on our plan to transform the Company and deliver shareholder value. And we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you all, and have a good evening.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri from Cowen and Company, your question please. Tim Arcuri I guess the first question, you talked about some new 10 g was the working. Can you just talk little more about that? Matt Murphy So what we really said in my prepared remarks was one reinforce the messages from Investor Day, which was really that we saw a market transition happening in the enterprise campus, in SMB markets starting now and over the next couple of years, transition to 2.5, 5 and 10 gig deployments. What we said also though that was incremental was that the same solutions for 10 gig that we targeted and we have been successful in in the enterprise areas we are also now getting design wins across several customers and platforms in 5G base station. And so that was encouraging, and I think it speaks to the quality of the product definitions in the engineering and also I would say our improved sales efforts here at Marvell to broaden the set of accounts and customers that we call on and promoting our solutions. So we just highlighted the 10 gig as an incremental opportunity for us in carrier, which we had not talked about in the Investor Day. Tim Arcuri And then Jean, the gross margins obviously is very, very strong, it dropped to almost double the revenue year-over-year o some of that cost cutting that. But some of things that I am excited, and I think you talked about as well. Some of the things seem to have long legs to them. So it seems like with what you’ve already done that there is more legs to gross margin, and then there is more you can do. So I guess my question is, is that the right way to think about it that some of the things do have longer legs here, and then is it reasonable to -- I know maybe you don’t want to commit to 65, I know that we’re sort of pushing you on this. But is that an unreasonable number over the longer team? Thank you. Jean Hu Yes, so I’ll give you some color, but Matt can add more about longer term on gross margin, right. When you look at the gross margin improvement, Matt talked about all the different efforts that we have been making. So when we look at the year-over-year gross margin improvement, really half of them are coming from cost reduction initiatives that Matt had talked about. The other half largely comes from product mix change and just managing our business and operation. So we are very pleased with the margin we achieved because we saw during our Analyst Day, we’ll get here sometime in the first half. So we’re really pleased we actually achieved it earlier. The guidance of 51% in Q2 largely reflects our thinking this is the run rate of gross margin, and those costs were not going to stop here. Matt, anything you… Matt Murphy Sure, maybe I'll add a few comments since I think this will be one of the bigger questions from investors and folks on the phone. So just add to what Jean said, as mostly I think recall when we started this journey from the beginning myself as well the rest of the management team really adopted a mind set and a mentality here as Marvell that really put gross margin as one of the key performance indicators of the Company. We have multiple reasons why we believe that’s important. One of those is that we believe it’s a reflection of the quality of the revenue and the quality of the engineering in the Company. And quite frankly, I don’t think any of us were satisfied at the level of the gross margin that Marvell is delivering in the past. So we made it a priority. But I have also said that there is really been no silver bullet on how we got here. There has been tremendous effort that’s happened, as Jean mentioned, on the operational side with working more closely with our suppliers; better negotiations practices; certainly focusing on things like things like yield; really I think our product and test engineering team has done a great job. Also, I think the benefits of our portfolio management that we did and obviously driving better mix and then being fortunate and having new products ramp, the number of factors it doesn’t stop here. We’re going to continue to put one foot in front of the other and do what we should be doing, which is good general management blocking and tackling. We’re not planning on upping our gross margin range at this point. But certainly, we have continued to make improvements against our internally set targets since we got here. And we’re encouraged by what we see, including the guide that we gave in Q1, which you could also argue have a little bit of mix working against this actually. So we’re not commenting beyond Q2, but it continues to be priority. And I think it's really a reflection of the value that’s actually inside Marvell as we have been fortunate to be part of actually unlocking that over the last nine to 10 months. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line John Pitzer from Credit Suisse, your question please. John Pitzer Matt, I guess, given that storage was so much stronger than seasonal in the April quarter. It’s pretty impressive that you guys guiding sequentially flat. I was hoping like you did for April, you might be able to give us a little bit color on the July guide as to how you think SSD versus HDD is doing in the quarter, and I guess even with the HDD client versus enterprise? And I asked the question because there seems to be a lot of investor confirmation that the HDD side of the business has been unusually strong over the last two quarters. And as that rolls off it’s going to be hard for you guys to teaching to grow. And I just want to get your comments on your SSD growth opportunities and your share growth within HDD and enterprise and data center? Matt Murphy I would say first it's at the highest level. We’ve been very encouraged by our progress in the overall storage market. I’d say agnostic stage to SSD with respect to the solutions that we’re delivering and now shipping into the end markets of enterprise and data center, and I think that’s a very positive mix shift for the Company that’s been ongoing since I got here. So between HDD and SSD, as we called out, we had very strong sequential growth into Q1 from Q4. And really what I would say on Q2 is we see that momentum continuing across both SSD and HDD for our solutions that go into the enterprise and data center. On the comment about HDDs running harder, I think that’s been almost the case since I got here. It seems like every quarter sort of keeps doing better from an industry point of view than people think. So we clearly keep our eye on that with respect to what our customers are up to and inventory levels. But we also react to, at the end of the day, we plan our business around what our customers need and that’s reflected in our guide. So I guess what I just again reiterate overall is we’re real positive on our storage business, both in HDD and SSD and I think the mix shift that we are seeing away from traditional PC client type of applications, enterprise an data centers very positive on our goal, whether it's SSD or HDD. John Pitzer And then may be as a follow up, Jean, given just all the moving parts in the revenue model now, it might be helpful if you can spend just a few minutes trying to level set as to how we should think about seasonality beyond July quarter, and what are the puts and takes on that? Jean Hu I think that’s something we have been looking at inside the Company. If you look at in the past, our business has changed a lot. So when we look at the seasonality frankly networking tends to be less seasonal. So if you look at our guidance for the Q2, it's really flat sequentially. In the second half, I think our view is actually because the new product cycle we have with all those 25 new products, we do see those products start to ramp up offset the legacy headwinds we set. So for networking that’s how we think about for the rest of the year. For the storage really, I think again the normal seasonality really that’s not we haven't seen played out this year. So it's difficult for us to call any normal seasonality going forward. I think as we guided for Q2, Q3 for many of the year the view we have is again like Matt said this on the enterprise data center side we’ll continue to see the expansion of our business for the rest of the year. So we’ll keep you posted about our progress there for sure. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS, your question please. Stephen Chin The first one I had was just hoping to get some more color on your SSD sales target for the back half of the fiscal year. I think Matt mentioned 25% to 30% of source sales target, and just given that math compared to where you are today, I think it would imply that this can roughly grow in the low to mid-20s figure? Just relative to your end market for the broader SSD market, do you think you can grow faster in the end market, of course to the 30% range and we’re seeing it at 50% today? Matt Murphy Sure, I'll take a stab at that, and I'll let Jean add any color as appropriate. What I would say is we have -- I would go back even to our November call when we decided to start giving more color around our SSD mix, which I believe was favorably received by everybody. And we had a nice progression from 20% above 20% and then now we’re guiding back half of the year in this 25% to 30% range. So you can make -- you can run your model across that spectrum to see the progress. And I think when you do that certainly would indicate that Marvell is growing faster than -- certainly this past quarter has been growing faster than the end market. And we believe that design when pipeline we have and the opportunities we have will get us to where guided. So I wouldn’t argue with that. I think that we’re not going to give exact specific numbers or specific detail percentile breakouts. But again, on the spirit of investor transparency, we’re just trying to show progress and then you can back to cross that against your own model and for gross rate market share change et cetera. But my summary point would be we just continue to feel very good about our position in that particular business as evidenced by the results not only in Q1 but where we see this ending as we head towards the back half of the year. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley, your question please. Craig Ellis I wanted to focus on two longer term questions, first following up on some of the end market commentary. Within the connectivity business, Matt, you mentioned that there were some automotive Ethernet wins that would generate revenue in fiscal '19. Can you quantify to the extent that you’re getting those wins either regionally or across customer set, so we can get a sense of the market penetration you may be already achieving relative to some of the comments you made at Analyst Day? Matt Murphy Sure. So just for clarity to back up one step, I think the way to think about the automotive opportunity and what I said in my prepared remarks was we actually saw design wins and momentum continuing to build in both the connectivity side, which is WiFi, WiFi Bluetooth combo chips for automotive, as well as automotive Ethernet, which includes PHYs as well as our switches with integrated PHYs. So number of different products across two different technologies that fit Marvell has considerable expertise and position. And so the way to think about the traction really, which is I think a very positive sign that I’ve seen is that it’s very broad based in nature in terms of geography that we saw wins across all three major regions. And it’s across multiple customers and OEMs as well. And having been involved with automotive for quite a bit of time, almost 10 years now, going back to 2007 when I got really involved with my old company. This concept of Ethernet in the vehicle was around even then, and what we do see is that, that vision of actually upgrading that legacy box in the car connecting all the desperate ECUs on one packet base network is starting to happen. And so we feel like we’re in a good position as Ethernet becomes more prolific in vehicle. And we’re calling out as an FY'19 and beyond, so we’re not quantifying any revenue yet or sizes. But you can imagine we’ll begin to talk more about that as we make progress towards these production ramps. But I think it's just the signal that we’ve got. We’ve got leverage from our existing R&D efforts that we can apply into adjacent markets that are growing very fast where new Sam is actually being created and we think automotive is one of those markets for us. Craig Ellis The follow up question relates to your commentary regarding Neil Kim's appointment as CTO and the question is this. Given his background at really creating significant extensibility to R&D capabilities and the efficiency implication thereto for Marvell, would you expect that to result in increased new product productivity for the team overtime or would it result in lower operating expense versus what we would have expected prior overtime? And are there gross margin implications given what he’ll be doing with the rest of the team? Thank you. Matt Murphy Sure, happy to comment a little bit more on Neil. So the first backdrop I would give is that we possess an incredibly talented engineering organization here at Marvell. And credit continues to go to the founding team of Marvell and the quality of the people that were brought in over many years and established. So we’ve got a phenomenal base of talent to work with. One thing that -- and it's a very creative and innovative and unique engineering team, I think in the industry. What I have observed since coming in is that there is some opportunity I think to put some more discipline and process and measurements and implement, I call them, more industry leading best known message into our engineering organization. And I think Neil is probably one of the best equipped individuals in the industry to actually bring that in. So with that translation for us right now is really getting more output, i.e. higher new product introduction quantity run rate, faster time to market, fewer spend, all these other benefits. So it's not necessarily a direct OpEx savings; although, I think when you start doing all those things, and you get more efficient, you obviously get benefits. But we’re really trying to more and get the team we’ve got actually to be even more productive. With respect to gross margin, I think, the impact I would just see there is it’s very clear in my history and in this industry and it's probably the view of the investor base as well is there’s a high correlation between the margins you can get on a product and the amount of time that takes to develop the product. So if you are first to market and you can have an advantage there, it has a tremendous lever on your gross margins and your profitability and your market position. And so I think as a side benefit by actually improving our new product cycle times and reducing spends, getting things out faster and more efficiently with higher yields, I think it will have all kinds of longer term benefits as you indicate. And I think he is one piece of the puzzle. There is a tremendous workforce here. But I think already he is influence is being felt and were really happy to have him here. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we do have a full queue this evening, so we ask that you please limit yourselves to one question each. You may get back in the queue as time allows. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from J. P. Morgan, your question please. Harlan Sur Good afternoon and solid job on the execution and the continued margin expansion. In networking, obviously, I know the sweet spot for the team continues to be enterprise campus SMB, good to see the traction with 10 gig and carriers. But for the cloud datacenter guys, it does seem like the transition to 25 gig per quarter is starting to move at a pretty rapid pace. Just wanted to get an update from you guys on the traction with your 25 gig switch solution, which I think you guys call Bobcat 3, I know you guys were showcasing that at OCP. And then maybe an update on some of the PHY solutions that you have that helps your customers leverage the existing 10 gig and 20 gig infrastructure, but still ratchet up to 25 gigabits per channel. So just wanted to understand that the team is already participating in this upgrade cycle? Thank you. Matt Murphy I think I’d just say the update as we did -- actually, first I would confirm all of your statements are accurate. We do have the products you mentioned now introduced and sampling, and in design win mode. And we called them out at the Investor Day, which I think would news to some investors because I think people had always thought we were this enterprise only campus only focused and this was our first foray. And we’ve been very pleased on both of those products that you mentioned, both attraction we see on our 25 gig switches, as well as the physical interface products on re-timers and repeaters. So that continues I think to track well. We don’t -- it's still early days, but you’re absolutely right that that traction in 25 gig across some of our enterprise customers, by the way also, that are moving up in the enterprise class datacenters, as well as the datacenter guys are moving in that direction. And so we’re pleased with the progress so far. But clearly, the Company's goal is to participate in that continued data center build out opportunity, which I think is a large Sam expansion for the entire industry over the next five years. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley, your question please. Joe Moore So on SSD I wonder if you could talk about the mix of enterprise versus client, you see any differences in those two markets. And then also if you could discuss any tightness of NAND supply, did that help you guys or hurt you guys from a share perspective and customer exposure perspective? Thank you. Jean Hu Yes, on the SSD side, what we have seen is our SSD business grow sequentially and year-over-year very significantly. And when we look at our enterprise where property mall index in SSD side to enterprise and the datacenter versus our HDD business, but our overall enterprise data center storage revenue have grown significantly during Q1. And so we’re not going to breakdown into exactly how much of our SSDs enterprise or SSD. But over the remaining of the fiscal year, we definitely will tell you that this is the trend of enterprise in datacenter business, both in HDD and SSD how we’re going to progress for the rest of the year. So on the NAND shortage question, we actually -- we have a strong relationship with our tier one OEM customers. So we are actually less impacted by the shortage. We do see some of our tier two customers get impacted. But overall, if we look at our revenue our top three, four customers, they’re all tier one OEMs. So we don’t see the impact there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Chris Rolland from Susquehanna, your question please. Chris Rolland I can't remember the last and I saw a company with double digit revenue growth, and OpEx down 20% year-on-year, so nice job there. Also, a nice sale on the LTE business as well; perhaps I shouldn’t looking it get towards in the month here. Perhaps you can describe the level of interest you have for any other products outside of the G.hn and LTE businesses that you sold in that 100 million that you could potential sell? And then lastly, since you guys are building your cash ops here perhaps your thoughts on M&A, particularly semi-stocks are up year-on-year so strongly? Matt Murphy So on the first one, which was the LTE sale, we were pleased to get that done. As Jean mentioned, that was not originally part of our discontinued ops because we thought the likely of selling it was low. So we were pleased to accomplish that, because I think; one, it's a good team and it's sound a good home with the company that actually wants to invest in this area; and we got $45 million for it. So I think that was a positive. All I would say is on the remaining discontinued ops, we’re still very much tracking to our plan that we announced back in November in our restructuring when we called out the disc ops. I have no updates on any details within that. But you are right, G.hn was part of it and there is some remaining work to be done there. Your second question was around M&A and our cash balance. And I think we’re in a very good position. We have a lot of flexibility at this point given the fact that we have $1.6 billion in cash and now you have seen what kind of operating income we’re generating that we believe we can generate on a go forward basis. And so that’s one where we continue to obviously look, we also understand where valuations are. So that’s always something that’s going to be a balance. But we’re very committed and I’ll just proactively answer this one for future questions that may come in that we’re going to remain very objective around this trade-off between holding enough of fire power versus returning to shareholders and so that’s the discussion that we continue to have on capital returns. I would say that we’re still early in our journey here at Marvell. We continue to make progress every quarter, and the second is that I think from a capital return point of view, as Jean mentioned, we did returned above the run rate that we had committed back in November. And so we’ve done about $290 million out of the $500 million estimate that we had made for the year. And of course with the dividend, you end with a pretty sizable shareholder return last quarter. So we’re going to continue to monitor both, and just keep one foot in front of the other on running our business. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company, your question please. Quinn Bolton I wanted -- so first on the SSD business. I believe you guys were working on a turnkey solution for the clients and retail side of business. Just wondering if you could give us an update on that? And then just a clarification, I believe you said that the client HDD business is weaker than what you had originally expected when you gave guidance 90 days ago. I am just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color there. What surprised you in that segment of the market? Jean Hu I'll take the HDD question first then Matt can answer the other SSD 10 gig question. So on HDD side, we did see the revenue on client HDD business was softer than we expected. Although, when we gave the guidance largely toward end of the quarter it’s probably as many of you have seen this, there is some inventory views that we suspect that’s related to that. So for us, we don’t see the end customers but certainly, we see the demand, it’s a little bit softer than what we expected. But overall, frankly, HDD market continues to be quite a stable. I would say, I would add on that one, but it’s a softer than we guided in Q4 when we had our earnings call long time ago. Matt Murphy And then I think on the SSD one. So as we have mentioned, there is a comprehensive efforts inside the Company to align various firmware and software efforts to get to a common full period churn key software solution that can actually run across multiple Marvell controllers. Today, we do have solutions for retail and we have code that shifts with that -- those controllers. And we’ve made some progress there. But that code today is not necessarily scalable across the entire Marvell product set. So I think that’s still a work-in-progress in terms of having, I would call, a more comprehensive solution. But clearly in the areas where we have targeted and had some very focused churn key offerings. We have made progress and that’s also been part of the some of the growth that we have had. So we are participating today, just to be clear, across the entire spectrum of SSD opportunities in retail, in client, which would be PC oriented all the way up to we mentioned a few times, I think this exciting opportunity in the data center. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank, your question please. Ross Seymore I want to focus on the OpEx and the operating margin, if I could, with my question. Jean, you guys are on a nice trajectory there in delivering on plan. Are you still committed to hitting that $206 million or the $820 million, $830 million run rate in the October quarter? And then as we look past there to get to that 30% operating margin target that Matt you and Jean talked about. Is that going to be achieved more on the revenue growth, leveraging from that existing level of OpEx? Or are there other absolute levels of OpEx or absolute changes in OpEx that would make that drop from dollar perspective? Jean Hu So on the restructuring side, we’re on track together to the target that we communicated during Investor Day, which is to get it to around between $820 million to $830 million run rate in Q3 of fiscal '18. So we are on track to get to that target. Just as a reminder, our Q4 fiscal '18, we actually will have 14 weeks, so this is whilst the four, five years that you end up catching up with 14 weeks quarter. So if I look at the OpEx model after we achieve our target, I would say, you have to add back that one additional week in Q4. So our operating expense -- we are going to be very disciplined in managing our operating expense going forward. And going back to the model, long term target model, we’re very committed to our 30% operating margin model. As we talked about during the Investor Day, we have the multiple levers, top line revenue growth, gross margin improvements and operating expense efficiency. So when you look at the three levers, we’re going to manage through it, we definitely believe our top line revenue will continue to grow as we communicated to everyone during the Investor Day, then gross margins and other level operating expense will be very disciplined. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley from Benchmark, your question please. Gary Mobley You mentioned in your prepared remarks some last time buyers some benefits from last time buy in the other product category. Is that having some influence on Q2 and can you talk to the magnitude of other revenue impact? Jean Hu Yes, so just a quick recap, it’s under our other product category. It includes a lot of things -- it includes our printer business, which actually is larger portion of that category. But it also includes application processors, some also the legacy product lines we had form the past. So it's a collection of the product lines, some of them we had last time buys. It's probably below 10% of our Q1 fiscal '18 revenue in that particular category. And it always had some last time buy even in Q2 but overall, we actually going to see once we get at fiscal '18 as I talk about during Investor Day. We are actually going to see this product this other category to be more stable, because then it's primarily going to our printer business, which is not growing but actually it's a very stable and flatter business. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie Research, your question please. Srini Pajjuri I have a clarification and a question. Jean, I think you said networking business still has some legacy that’s declining. Just curious as to if you could clarify how big that legacy business is? And then in terms of my question, the connectivity business, I guess you are guiding from 30% sequential. And I understand there is seasonality. I am just trying to figure out to what extent this is normal seasonality versus new design wins? And then how we should think about seasonality beyond Q2 in connectivity? Thank you. Jean Hu Yes, on your first question on the networking side, the legacy product lines, it’s about between 15% to 20% of the revenue of our networking business revenue and those product lines actually have long life, they last four, five years. But during the fiscal '18, as we talked about last two quarter, we see some drop for the last quarter and next few quarters. But after that, as I said in the second half, our new product revenue ramp is going to offset that legacy product decline. And your second question is about wireless connectivity, right. On the wireless connectivity side, more than 30% sequential increase is largely driven by the seasonal demand on the gaming side and the some of the connected home solutions. We are also getting tractions on the enterprise access point and some of the high end of performance connected home solutions. I would say this is more seasonal than regular, because we do see the gaming segment has been quite healthy. Typically, for the wireless connectivity business, you will see this quarter is the highest quarter and then it started to come down. Of course after the holiday season here you are going to see seasonal significant decline of wireless connectivity, because the seasonal -- typical seasonal cycle. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup, your question please. Atif Malik If I look at your segment sales, storage was about $5 million below seed expectations, mobile and networking were in line and most of that side came from the other line; and as you’re gliding to 4% decline year-over-year for revenues. How should we think about your revenue growth year-over-year basis in October and January? And what is going to make the growth revenue accelerate? Is it going to be the new products in the networking side or SSD share? Can you just talk about what's going to cause the year-over-year revenue decline to revert its course? Jean Hu Maybe, I just want to clarify. When you look at our Q2 guidance, at the middle point of our guidance, our storage and networking and connectivity business actually will grow 5% year-over-year. The other category of the products would decline more than 30% year-over-year. So the overall Company at the middle point of our guidance is actually flattish. But our call business is actually growing year-over-year. I think if you think about going forward as we outlined during our Investor Day is we do think our storage business and networking business are going to grow faster than market. And our performance in Q1 is strong validation of that. And our wireless connectivity business is going to grow along the line of the market. That’s how we’re driving the overall business to grow. The other category we said in fiscal '18 is going to decline 30% year-over-year. But beyond of fiscal '18, if you have some slight headwind to our overall revenue growth, but we do believe we’ll be able to grow our overall revenue above the market. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays, your question please. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs, your question please. Mark Delaney The question is on the enterprise hard drive business, if I understood correctly, that part of the hard drive business was better than what have been expected when you gave guidance. You talked a little bit about what's driving the upside in the enterprise market. Do you think you’re seeing acceleration with some of the share gains or the end market strength? And then maybe you can just help us to understand just the breath of programs that you are targeting for share gains within enterprise HDD controllers? Thank you. Matt Murphy So a couple of things, one is the performance that we saw. We did indicate when we guided and as well as at the Investor Day that that particular segment we were pleased to see new ramps occurring in Q1, which were new programs that we haven't participated in before. And then that occurred, which is good and we continue to see progress there. We are not in the business really of doing back and forth on a share gain discussion. I think the way we think of it is the HDD market overall is fairly established; there is two large players; there is finite set of customers; and really we’re focused on obviously a segment of the market in making progress there, which is the capacity oriented near line drive and enterprise drive. And we’ll continue to do that. But we’re not in the business of trying to call out share gains other than we’re saying that we’ve got some new programs that ramp they were higher than last year and we’re pleased with that progress. And so that’s all I am going to say on the HDD enterprise side. I think it's a good opportunity for Marvell to participate, going forward. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy from Stifel, your question please. Kevin Cassidy On your 25 gig switch, can you say what customers you are getting attraction with? Is it the tier two, tier one light backs or any other above? Matt Murphy I think what I would say is we’re not at liberty at this point to do any specific customer disclosers, just because we don’t have that provision. But what I would say is that there is a lot of interest in the products that the interest is across, I would say, the range of those types of accounts. So it's not something that is targeting at like one or two customers. I think there is going to be -- we are hoping broad based adoption for it. But at this point, we’re still pretty early too in securing those lens, and really kind of running the gauntlet on some of the qualifications we need to do. So I think we’ll probably have to table that one for later as we make progress. But when we can, we’re certainly happy to provide more discloser around that. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Vivel Arya from Bank of America, your question please. Vivel Arya I just wanted to maybe go back to one of the prior questions. There have been some concerns about double ordering and component tightness in the supply chain. Matt, I was just wondering what you have seen. Is there any abnormal behavior in terms of demand that could normalize? Or do you really think that the demand environment stays quite strong and the supply environment is quite balanced a bit? Thank you. Matt Murphy Yes, sure happy to answer that question. I think, I am certainly aware of the commentary that’s been out there from a number of suppliers. I think the lot of commentary has come more out of the component or catalog or mix signal type of analog companies. And we’re not really in that business. So we tend to be fairly specific in the SoCs we sell. We sell finite number of products to some very large customers. Distribution is a pretty small percentage of our sales. So from our point of view, we see the lead time environment supply chain all that’s running very normally here at Marvell. Certainly -- but I have been to enough of these cycles to know sometimes you don’t know when you are in them. But certainly having lived through those, it doesn’t feel like at least we have Marvell experiencing that kind of thing. I think we have seen in the supply chain pockets of tightness depending on the particular supply or the particular -- either process node or thing that we need to procure in order to make our products. But that’s really isolated. So I would say for Marvell we’re probably not the canary and the coal mine on that one. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tom Sepenzis from Northland Securities, your question please. Tom Sepenzis You’ve talked about networking and obviously the strong growth that you’re seeing in the connectivity business. Can you talk a little bit about what your expectations are for storage as a whole in the second half of the year? Obviously, SSDs are doing well. But are HDDs causing a little bit of headwind there, should we expect growth in the second half? Matt Murphy So I think we’ll limit our commentary today around our storage outlook really to the SSD one only, and that was really given to again provide a little more transparency around the progress that we’re making there. And also, I think that -- because that’s a growing market and that pipeline I think is pretty well understood, we were comfortable giving those ranges. I think with respect to calling HDD at this point in the second half, we’re really in the business of guiding one quarter at a time. I don’t really know what that’s going to look like. We’re fairly looking at the indicators. But certainly, as we get into the next quarter call and we have some more visibility or when it’s appropriate, we’d be happy to share our views. But we’re not ready to really make a prediction on the second half at this particular juncture. Operator Thank you. And this does conclude the question and answer session of today's program. I would like to hand the program back to Matt Murphy for any further remarks. Matt Murphy Thank you very much. Just a couple words here, in closing, I would like to thank everyone for spending some time with us today to talk about Marvell's Q1 results. We are executing well on our plan to transform the Company and deliver shareholder value. And we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you all, and have a good evening. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Morgan 45th Annual Technology, Media and Telecom Conference Call May 23, 2017, 11:20 am ET Executives Chris Capossela - Executive Vice President, Chief Marketing Officer Analysts Mark Murphy - JPMorgan Mark Murphy Okay. Good morning everyone. I am Mark Murphy, a software analyst with J.P. Morgan and it is a great pleasure to be here with Chris Capossela, who is an EVP and Chief Marketing Officer with Microsoft. Chris, thank you so much for joining us. Chris Capossela Yes. Thanks for having me. It's great to be here. Mark Murphy I was hoping we could maybe kick this off by listening to any opening comments you might have and maybe more importantly a little bit of a background or an introduction of yourself. Chris Capossela Okay. Great. So thanks everyone obviously for being here and for your support of Microsoft. My name is Chris Capossela and I am the Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Vice President for Microsoft. I on Satya's senior leadership team. So I am a peer to Amy hood, if many of you know her as our CFO. We get to work very closely together and we thought it would be fun to have me spend time with our big investors obviously and I am also from Boston. I have been at Microsoft for 25 years, joined right out of college and had a ton of different jobs and it was three years ago that Satya became our third CEO and a month into his tenure or so he asked me to take on the role of Chief Marketing Officer and join his leadership team. And it's just been an unbelievable sort of three years of having a front row seat at a massive, massive cultural transformation inside the company that I think people have seen outside the company as well. Mark Murphy So let us begin with. Let's talk about the brand perception of the company. Chris Capossela Sure. Mark Murphy You have had this very long, very successful career at Microsoft. It sounds like Satya recognized you immediately within a month and give you this role. You have worked office and productivity. You have worked in consumer and the commercial businesses. You have also been instrumental as well in the retail channel. And I wanted to ask you as a marketer what is it that you think customers get right about Microsoft's image and the understanding of Microsoft's vision? And then on the flipside, what misconceptions do you think might be lingering around where you would spend advertising, marketing dollars to try to correct them. Chris Capossela Yes. I mean I think, by and large, know the brand health is just fantastic. If you look at the Interbrand surveys or the BrandZ surveys, they will have Microsoft in the top three or four or five of all brands on the planet and that's fantastic. The competition in tech has other companies in that top list too. So we have obviously our work cut out for us. I would say that for us, the most important thing is to really get people to understand that Microsoft is not really focused on trying to be a cool kid. We are not focused on some of the things that I think our tech competitors focus on. We are really about empowerment. And Satya spent his time crafting a new mission for the company with the senior leadership team, that's to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. And so the keyword for us is really empowerment where we are never going to worry about whether we are viewed as a cool company. We are going to be worried about making sure that the things people can do with our products are amazing and the things they do are likely to be cool. If you look at the top 100 books on The New York Times Best Sellers, the people who write those and those books are amazing. The vast majority of those are written work is Word. Is Word cool? Not at all. Word is not going to be a cool tool. But man, it's an empowerment tool. And so I think telling those stories of empowerment are really important to us as a company. And I think that's what you are seeing us do more and more with our marketing. Most of our marketing now has real people telling their stories of what they are doing with Microsoft technology to transform their company or transform how they spend their personal time. And if you were to just look at the advertisements we run or the videos we make, the vast majority of them now have real people onscreen saying, hey, I am a New York City police officer sketch artist and I sketch the bad guys. And here is how I use the Surface Pen to do that and here is why I love it. Or I am Temenos and I am bringing banking to every country that has a phone and the Microsoft cloud is allowing me to do that. So we want to really tell these empowerment stories and if people think of us as a company that helps power commercial business, consumers, et cetera, then I think we are doing the right thing. But I love how people are viewing the company right now. It's very positive and the outside perspective finally matches the inside perspective. And that hasn't been true, you know, prior to Satya taking on the CEO role. There was real disconnect between the inside company see how we saw each other and how the outside world saw us. And so that's been awesome to see change. Mark Murphy So Word isn't cool, but I will tell you Excel is pretty cool for this audience. Chris Capossela Yes. And you know, that's what it comes down to, like, financial people will tell you, Excel's feels amazing. But if you talk to somebody who is an author, they wouldn't say Excel is amazing. They would say Word is amazing. Mark Murphy Right. Chris Capossela It is all what it does for you, makes it a very important to you. But I think from a brand perspective, people ask me all the time, what are you doing to make Microsoft cool and it's like nothing. I mean we are literally doing nothing to make it cool. We are trying to build great things. And if Surface, people love Surface, fantastic. I want to love you it. But am I doing some metric about cool. I am not doing any metrics about cool. We measure, do people think Microsoft's best days are ahead? Does Microsoft does tools that matter in my life? Am I proud to use Microsoft products? Would I recommend Microsoft to my friends and family? Those things we measure. No cool factor is in any measurement that we do. And that, I think, is the right mindset for us to have. Even if someone says to me, Minecraft is so cool, fantastic. I love it. It's just not the goal to make it cool. It's a goal to make it awesome. And I love that my daughter spends hours in Minecraft instead of watching TV or whatever. I think it's a great thing. Mark Murphy So if we go back, so in some ways, there has been some real internal change, right? So if you go back a decade, Microsoft was viewed by this audience as being a PC centric company. You had struggling products like the Zune player. You had the less successful Windows launch of Windows Vista. Remember that one? Chris Capossela Are you kidding? Yes. I lived through it. I look like I look today because of Windows Vista. Mark Murphy It would be fun to have more grey hair. But anyway, you look at the company today and you have got these leading-edge technologies, you have got the HoloLens and there are incredible demos of the HoloLens right now. It looks like it's a step ahead. You have strong advancements in AI. You have cognitive services. You have the Azure platform. How do you think, how was the marketing and branding and advertising kind of evolved to keep lockstep when the technological evolution is so rapid? Chris Capossela Yes. Obviously, we try to market what we have as opposed to any visionary future. I am never a huge fan of marketing stuff that people can't that can go use. And so it's one thing to do a sexy demo or give a speech that you have some far-off vision that people get excited about. But I don't think you market those things. I think those are used at important moments in time. The marketing has to be about telling how companies can do better than they are doing today using your stuff. So we really try to focus on what's possible today. HoloLens is far more than a demo. We have a developer edition out. We have huge companies doing amazing things with HoloLens. So the PGA is doing some cool things with HoloLens. Volvo and Japan Airlines and many, many companies. So that's actually a very real thing and that I can market. And I want to market what they are doing. Hey, how are we reinventing learning with the HoloLens with Case Western University? How is Japan Airlines reimagining the way training happens to service a jet engine. Jet engines are huge. It's very expensive and hard to train people on how to service them if they have to actually be in front of the jet engine all the time. With HoloLens you don't. You can actually have a regular room that you put the HoloLens on and now you are seeing a hologram of the jet engine and you can have fantastic training with the holograms themselves, moving around, flipping the hologram, getting to the inside components of the hologram without disassembling the jet engine. There are some amazing things there. So we went to market what's real. We want to market how we can help people digitally transform. And for me, one of the metrics of success is just how often when I call on a customer are we talking about licensing Office versus how often are we talking about how we can help you transform your company? And boy, if you want to know the most shocking difference of the old Microsoft versus the new Microsoft, it's how little time I spend talking about the licensing details of Office and how much time I spend helping customers understand how they can digitally transform their entire company on the Microsoft Cloud, which Office is a major component of. But the dialogue isn't about pricing and packaging and skewing, it's about how do we do this cultural transformation, how do we change our business. And that means we are in very, very good place. Mark Murphy So I want to ask you what artificial intelligence is going to be in for this whole equation? Chris Capossela Yes. Sure. Mark Murphy Many of us, we were just at your Build Conference, a great successful conference up in Seattle. You demoed some incredible technologies, in my opinion. There was computer vision. There was speech. There was that text understanding. You, of course, have Cortana in the portfolio. Many of us thought that this Story Remix that was a big hit. It was a way to take -- it takes your photos and your videos and it will kind of automatically create a movie out of them. Chris Capossela That's right. Mark Murphy It will put it to music and then you click a little button and it will remix the whole thing and do it all differently. Chris Capossela You can pick the actor you want to be the star. You could pick one of the -- Mark Murphy It was incredible. You can tag them and the text will follow them. You can turn a soccer ball and it will be an exploding soccer ball. It was really incredible. So these things demo well, but Google is also pretty hard at work. Chris Capossela Oh, yes. Mark Murphy On artificial intelligence. And they are no slouch in this arena. And so I want to ask you who do you think has the clearest vision for AI right now? And as a company, how do you think about building a sustainable advantage in that market? Chris Capossela Yes. I mean obviously I want to say we have the best vision in it. It's no huge surprise. I think you know Google is not the only one. Everybody, obviously, is jumping on sort of the AI bandwagon. One of the things that I love about Microsoft is just the deep amount of investments we have made in deep research. And so to do AI well, it's not a gimmick. Like you have to have an incredible team of researchers that are dedicated to these really, really hard computer science problems of vision or of speech-to-text or text-to-speech or the many, many different things that we are working on. And I only think there is a handful of companies that have built the deep research talent inside the company to do this really well and certainly Microsoft would be at the top of the list. Harry Shum is super recognized as many others are. He leads our AI and research team. But then obviously, the magic comes into how do you figure out how to apply it. And for us AI, I think is broader than it is for more companies. Many companies you take a look at like IBM with Watson, it's one thing. And they talk about it as one thing. And they have done a ton of marketing on it, et cetera. But for Microsoft, AI actually spans so many different things we do. These cognitive services are services that developers can use right now to integrate AI into their own applications. So if you want to make a construction site safer using cameras, we demoed this at Build. We are just using off-the-shelf cameras on a construction site that is always under surveillance anyways, for safety reasons. The cameras can do amazing things using our cognitive services and the Microsoft Cloud to identify that a dangerous piece of equipment hasn't been put away correctly or there is a chemical spill that no ones attending to. And having the AI to do that, those developer services exist right now. But Microsoft also has the ability to build AI into the products that you are all using every single day. So when you use Office, more and more of Office is going to be driven by these AI models to make it incredibly easy for you to get started in Excel or get started in PowerPoint, figure out what data you should go bring into your Excel spreadsheet based on what you are doing. There is just so much that we can do that. It isn't just about the developer, but that's actually about the billions of people who use Windows and Office every day. So for us, there is multiple components for our AI strategy and I think we have got the broadest view of it. And you saw a lot of the press coming out of the Build saying, wow, we were really impressed with Microsoft's approach to AI, which is great for us to see. Mark Murphy So the structural advantage for Microsoft, it will begin with the quality of the talent that you have in the research lab. Chris Capossela Right. Mark Murphy The commitments to the research labs. The PhDs that you have there. But are you trying to say that there is a structural advantage in being able to not just infuse AI into your own Microsoft technology, but being able to appeal to the base of developers that are going to unleash their own with the developer toolkit? Chris Capossela Yes. That's right. You need to make AI capabilities available through the cloud platform so that any developer can just come and bring AI to their own solutions. So Azure has to be great at giving you massive sort of supercomputing capabilities for AI. The actual AI APIs for learning and vision and speech have to be there. And then every developer can get at them and we can integrate AI into our own first party applications. And that's where I think you get a span that's broader than what most companies will be able to do. Mark Murphy Okay. Now let's list transition that into a little discussion of AWS versus Azure. Chris Capossela Sure. Mark Murphy I want to ask you, I guess the simple question is, just how do you position the differentiators between these platforms from a marketing perspective? When you look at the numbers, Amazon's footprint is larger if you are just looking at the Infrastructure-as-a-Service. So the compute and storage, they are run rating a little under $15 billion. Azure's run rating around $3.5 billion right now. But Azure is growing faster. It's growing noticeably faster. And I want to understand, how do you make sure the world doesn't get stuck in a mindset that this is just a commodity layer? It's storage and compute. There is no difference between these two platforms and treating like a commodity. Chris Capossela Correct. First, I won't confirm those numbers. So just for the record, I don't recognize that Azure number but I am sure you have a model behind it. I just want to make sure I don't say yes to that number. Mark Murphy I understood. We understand there is some wiggle room in the big picture. Chris Capossela Anyways, I would say a couple of things. One of the most important things we hear from customers that our approach is quite different than other cloud providers, is this deep understanding of the need for hybrid. A deep understanding that the ability to write an application for the public cloud and then be able to run it in their own data center using Azure stack is a massive advantage. If you want to do business in Russia, it's hard to find a data center. a cloud provider in Russia that meets all the needs of Russia, as one example, but there are many other examples. With Azure stack, you can buy your own hardware, you can run it yourself in whatever place you want to run it and yet you are building an application that works exactly on-premise as it works in the Azure Cloud. So there is a major shipping and tour company that has big cruise liners that take people out into the big open ocean and they loved the notion of Azure stack because they can write their applications for when people are connected to the Internet, the ship is connected, but they can also write their applications and run them on Azure stack on the ship when they are not connected or when it's very expensive to be connected, you may choose not to be connected. So Microsoft's really the only one who can take you from your data center to a hybrid data center to the public cloud and that alone is a massive, massive advantage as big enterprise IT moves from holding onto everything to realizing that the world is going to be a blend and I think that realization that the world is a blend of public and hybrid and private is something that plays to Microsoft's strength. Then you get to the actual things we offer on Azure that are incredibly differentiated. Office 365 is built on Azure. Dynamics 365 is built on Azure. These higher-level services that aren't about storage. The cloud storage business is a very uninteresting business. But running full-fledged machine learning models that help companies do predictive analytics for when they should repair their elevators, that's actually very high value, there you can charge a margin for that business and that plays to our strength. So Infrastructure-as-a-Service may be a requirement, but it's not actually where we think the exciting and interesting part of the cloud is going. That's the higher level services that we actually feel like we can do quite well. And you are seeing that in our growth rates. Then you can get super technical and you say, hey, we have a better data center footprint than anybody else. We are in more regions than Amazon and Google combined. We are the only public cloud company that legally operates in China. We are the only public cloud company that has a data center in Germany that respects the data sovereignty laws of Germany. So those are good advantages too. But I think hybrid is critical and the higher level services. Those are the ones that will last that are really differentiating over many, many years. Mark Murphy So hybrid and higher-level services. If this whole war, if the cloud platform's war is starting to enter a new phase, right, if we look back on it and say Phase 1 really was about tech-first companies. It was about Uber and Netflix and Airbnb. Chris Capossela Okay. Mark Murphy If we look forwards and say, Phase 2 is going to be about enterprise IT, would it be your opinion that having these higher-level services is essentially going to allow Microsoft to catch up and surpass AWS in that market for storage and compute? Or would your answer be, well, it doesn't really matter. It's all going to come down to the higher level services anyway? Chris Capossela I certainly think that the track record that we have in the enterprise plays well to Microsoft's strength. The account teams that we have calling on large enterprises. The fact that most are running their email through our cloud and email, believe it or not, has become just this incredibly important line of business system and we have many, many CEOs telling me, hey, I can deal with an SAP outage, I can't deal with an email outage for a second. So you have to have, 99.999%, five nines isn't enough for your email system. I think having that track record and that relationship where customers trust us, they know there are going to be mistakes made, but they trust us to respond to those mistakes really well. There is no doubt as the data estate and datacenters move to the cloud on the enterprise side that we have a wonderful opportunity that's ours to lose, shall we say, but I also speak to lots of companies that are on AWS and they tell me the today 90% of my spend in the cloud is AWS and only 10% of it is on Azure and I already have a goal to make that 50-50. And that has actually nothing to do with, they believe in us more, they literally just want balance of trade. They literally just want the ability to sort of say, hey, it's going to be better for my company if I use multiple vendors here and obviously a given that Amazon is in the top spot and we are in the same spot, we have a lot of headroom from simply playing balance of trade across the cloud. Mark Murphy So dual sourcing for whether it's redundancy or back up or just having -- Chris Capossela Or pricing. Mark Murphy Or pricing. Chris Capossela Exactly. Negotiation power, sure. Mark Murphy And that's going to become common. Chris Capossela Without a doubt. I hear that more and more from people. And that basically says, hey, we have arrived. People see us as a real vendor in the space and we are actually the clear number two. And so there is a lot of upside for us. Mark Murphy Yes. Okay. And we see that in our CEO survey work, by the way. It certainly backs up that a lot of progress is going to be made by Azure. We have about 13 minutes remaining. Why don't we check now for questions from the audience. We have one up here in the front and could we get a microphone up here? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Q - Unidentified Analyst I can speak loud too. Mark Murphy She is almost here. There it is. Unidentified Analyst Okay. Thank you. Relative to industrial IoT, could you talk a little bit about, because a lot of people in the room are interested in this, what role Azure is going to play in terms of providing Edge services and what industry areas are you guys going to concentrate on? So very interested in that area in terms of what you are doing? Chris Capossela So at our Build Conference, we talked about our world view of computing moving to this intelligent cloud and intelligent edge where the cloud is incredibly important, but there will be 25 billion devices that are connected and considered smart devices in the next couple of years according to your various industry analysts. And so there is just a massive opportunity for us to have intelligence at the edge of the cloud that runs on these devices themselves. Lots of people like to think about the mobile phone as the device, but we see industrial opportunities, just an incredibly wide array of different device types. We have a wonderful opportunity at Microsoft and IoT is one of our fastest-growing Azure services to have a lot of these devices be powered by Windows and to have even more of these devices use our Azure IoT services that allow them to do compute on the device itself. You can imagine building a neural network on Azure and then deploying it to an edge device that's doing something super interesting. Maybe it's a robot or a snake that somebody's driving into a place that a human being can't crawl into to do some sort of security thing and that's an amazing opportunity. We think there is going to be tons of these. I mentioned cameras getting smarter and smarter and being able to do workplace safety where you are building a sort of neural network in Azure, deploying it to device on the edge and that device on the edge becomes incredibly valuable to a company for all the things that it can do. Whether it's workplace safety, whether it's checking towers for needing to be repaired. Those things are all super interesting to us. Retail is a vertical that we think this is really interesting for. Discrete manufacturing is an industry we think this is very interesting for. Financial services would be another one. Healthcare would be another one. So four or five industries that we think IoT is particularly well-suited to and this notion of devices on the edge of the cloud are areas where we are pretty excited to go after. And hopefully we will see lots of great Azure growth, but also Windows Embedded growth as well as Windows powers a lot of devices you may not know that it's powering. Gas stations, vending machines, et cetera. Mark Murphy Are there questions from the audience? We have another one right here. Unidentified Analyst Recently, there was a New York Times article on how Google has taken over the classroom. Anecdotal, my son is in second grade and when he does school projects, he actually does not use or uses Google Docs and it's not his choice, it's what the school as a whole uses. Is education and schools and classrooms an important frontier for Microsoft? Chris Capossela Yes. It is. The education space is a really interesting space, because everything is basically free when it comes to software and technology. The hardware is obviously not free, but the software is. And so from a business model perspective, you would say, huh, but from these are the workers of the future. These are the CEOs and the inventors of the future. And so we think it's very important for us to have today's students, particularly starting in middle school maybe even fourth grade and up using Windows and using Office and using Minecraft in the classroom, using Skype in the classroom, we think is really interesting opportunities for us. I know the article you are talking about. A couple of weeks ago we had a major education event that Satya kicked off where we introduced a new version of Windows called Windows 10 S and we introduced a bunch of hardware from our hardware partners, including a brand-new laptop from Microsoft called the Surface laptop that runs on Windows 10 S. And Windows 10 S has the very important capability of essentially being locked down. You can't download anything from the web on the machine and it starts up very quickly and it stays very clean and safe and secure a thousand days later after you start using it. And most Macs and Windows PCs don't have that property because it can download anything. They sort of get cruddy over time and you have to go back and clean them up. And this is one of the reasons that Google has had success in the education space with Chromebook that don't have that property. So we think the combination of Windows 10 S plus low-priced hardware from our hardware partners plus fantastic tools like OneNote which students absolutely love, like Minecraft which helps kids learn how to program in the classroom. We have some real assets that Google doesn't have that we think we are ready to really do a phenomenal job in the education space and I think that's super important. If you look broadly around the world, Windows and Office are still incredibly strong in education, but there are countries like the U.S. where we have a lot of room to do better and we think Windows 10 S, great hardware, great manageability to manage these devices, Minecraft, Skype, OneNote, Office, we have got a really awesome story to tell and we are ready to go out and tell it now. Mark Murphy There is one back there. Unidentified Analyst Thank you. You had just an in-depth comparison between Azure and AWS. Can you talk about the differentiation you have between your AI and Google's AI? Which one's better? And you talked about data and analytics and Google also offers that. How do you differentiate your product compared to theirs? Chris Capossela Yes. So Harry Shum would be a much better person to answer this question than me, but I would say that there is a whole series of tests that these AI engines get put through in terms of who does a better job at a deeper level of understanding and this is true computer science. These aren't like industry benchmarks run by a Gartner. This is now we are talking about let's go visit MIT, Carnegie Mellon, et cetera, et cetera. And they are people who dedicate their lives to doing computer vision. And one of the areas that we really excel in is computer vision. Being able to recognize objects in the world and not just tell you that it's a person, but actually be able to give you incredible detail about what that person is doing, the emotions that that person has, what the person is looking at, if they are wearing glasses, if they are wearing a blouse, what color is that blouse. Like the ability for us to recognize objects goes, I think, far beyond what anybody else has done. Now I am sure Google is busy trying to do better than us and we will continue to leapfrog. That is the technology world. But I would say today, Harry would probably sit up here and say, I would happily compare our algorithms around vision, text, speech et cetera to anybody's and we think they are better than anybody's in the world. You look at we just showed with PowerPoint. And we did this demo using what we call Translator integrated into PowerPoint where somebody was speaking to a PowerPoint slide in English and anybody else on their phone could essentially dial in to the presentation and you choose the language that you want to see the subtitles in on your phone and we support something like 60 languages. So I am speaking in English and on this phone, it's showing what I am saying in Chinese, on this phone it's showing what I am saying in Spanish, on the screen we are showing what I am saying in French as subtitles. That type of speech-to-text translation at high, high levels of accuracy, we would say we are doing better than anybody else. I am sure there is a slew of tests that Google would say they are doing better than us. We are both quite good at this. But I don't think there are 20 companies that are quite good at this. I think it's a very small number of companies that can afford to put the R&D into being really world-class at AI, just like there are very few companies that can be world-class at running global data centers. So we think it's a very small number of players, one, two or three, probably two or three. And we are very proud to be at the top of that list. And we are going to fight every day. But there aren't going to be 20 of them. It's going to be a very small number. I though I saw a hand way in the back with a kind of blue sweater, but maybe he got his question answered. Any other questions? Mark Murphy There is one in the back left corner. Chris Capossela A cell phone waving. Mark Murphy Yes. Unidentified Analyst Sorry to make you run. Can you talk a little bit more about China? Microsoft has said repeatedly, Satya and you just now that Azure is the only public cloud to operate legally in China. Amazon would disagree with that, I think. Can you go into a little more detail about what you mean? Chris Capossela Well, having a data center actually in China run through a joint venture with Chinese organization that the government recognizes, we are the only ones in the world that do that. Google doesn't do that. Amazon doesn't do that. There are Chinese companies that do it, of course. We are the only multinational that does that. That's specifically what I am talking about. Any other? There he is. Mark Murphy That was the one. Unidentified Analyst Can you talk about gross margin progression in your cloud business? Chris Capossela Sure. Unidentified Analyst Overall cloud makes 50% gross margins now, I believe? Chris Capossela Yes. Unidentified Analyst Can you comment on the individual components? And how you see that over the next couple of years? Chris Capossela That I can't comment on, of the individual components. I will get in deep trouble. Amy will never ever let me out of the house again if I talk about the individual components. I will tell you, I think if Amy were here, she would say, hey, look the progress that we are making, both on the cost of sale side, we are pleased with and also on the cost of providing the service, the actual COGS of running Azure, Office 365, we are making the progress that she expects us to make, which I think is very good progress. So I think both the cost to get a sale and the marketing cost to acquire a customer are headed in the right direction as well as substantial improvements on the cost to run our cloud infrastructure. We want to see progress on both of those things and we are seeing progress on both of those things. I think she would also say, hey, quarter-to-quarter, you may see some lumpiness as the investments we make in CapEx might boost a little bit this quarter when we open up a new data center or what have you. But in general, I think we are very happy to be on the plan that she has laid out, both from the $20 billion cloud revenue run rate, but also from getting the gross margin to be where we want it to be. And I think there is nothing that we see structurally that makes us feel like we can't be at scale that Amazon is at with fantastic or with very good gross margin. And I think that answer will allow me to keep coming back to conferences like this. Mark Murphy We would like that. And on that note, we are out of time. We will wrap up there. Chris, it has been such a great honor having you with us. And thank you for joining us. Chris Capossela Thank you so much. Thank you Mark. Nice to meet you.

Tim Yates, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Stoever, President and Chief Operating Officer, will review the company's financial results and then we'll open the call up for questions. Also on the call today is (0:59), Head of Corporate Development, Financial Planning and Analysis; and John Rohan, Vice President of External Reporting. Earlier this morning, Monster issued a news release announcing first quarter 2016 financial results. A copy of the release is available on the company's Investor Relations website, at ir.monster.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements under applicable securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the company's SEC filings for a description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Forward-looking statements reflect the company's views as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update these statements as a result of new information or future events.

Certain of those non-GAAP measures exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and other pro forma items described in the news release. The company's GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures can also be found in the release. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim. Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Bob. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today for Monster's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our order will be slightly different today. First, I will review the quarter's financial performance and highlight key business trends. Mark will then update you on the 2016 operational priorities we outlined last quarter with particular emphasis on actions taken to improve our results in the North American Core Careers business. Then I'll wrap up with comments on our cash flow, balance sheet, capital allocation and guidance. The highlights of the quarter include continued improvement in our European and Asian markets. All countries showed sequential revenue growth. Continued mix performance in our North American channels. Some channels such as staffing and healthcare continued to show growth. Our commercial channels are being negatively impacted by increased value price competition leading to churn in our account base, particularly among those clients where we do not enjoy a deep multi-product relationship. Continued penetration of our new product offerings during the quarter and on a global basis now equal 8% of revenue. During the quarter, we also had increases in our backlog for our MGS and commercial software solution activities. And we significantly increased cash EBITDA to $19.5 million. As you know, our two primary metrics are revenue and cash EBITDA. But since we have used a variety of metrics over time, I'm going to take you through the various GAAP and non-GAAP metrics we have used both of the consolidated company and reporting segment level. All percentages are on a constant currency basis. Starting at the company consolidated level on slide one. The financial highlights for the quarter are, total revenue was $157.8 million, a 1% sequential decline compared to our flat to slightly up expectation. The shortfall is primarily caused by lower than planned performance in our Core North American and MGS military businesses. Cash EBITDA was $19.5 million, a 3% increase over the prior quarter and an $11 million increase over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $21.5 million. Pro forma earnings per share were $0.07. Slide two is a bit more granular and provides a bridge between GAAP operating income and pro forma operating income. As anticipated, pro forma operating expenses of $146 million were $5 million higher sequentially and $14 million lower on a year-over-year basis. The sequential increase was primarily driven by an increase in salary and related expense as a result of reversal of previously accrued AIP or bonus in Q4 2015, because our AIP plan did not fund during 2015. The bridge between pro forma operating income and GAAP operating income includes the following charges; during Q1 2015, charges of $24.5 million were primarily the result of cash restructuring charges related to our Reallocate to Accelerate program. Q4 2015 charges of $10.9 million resulted primarily from an impairment charge related to capitalized software. And this quarter, $3 million came as a result of pro forma items associated with continuing severance associated with the change in North America sales and advisory fees, which we do not consider to be a normal part of our ongoing business. After taking these charges into consideration, this quarter's GAAP operating income was $8.3 million and cash EBITDA was $19.5 million. You can see the comparable period numbers on the chart. Slide three provides a bridge between GAAP net income from continuing operations and cash EBITDA and then from cash to adjusted EBITDA. Those items shaded in purple equal the total adjustments shown on the previous slide. Going forward, from a modeling perspective, we would expect relatively constant levels of depreciation and amortization, relatively constant levels of interest expense, annual adjusted tax provision in the range of 35%, and slightly higher levels of stock-based compensation as a result of a new long-term incentive plan enacted during the 2016 first quarter. Turning now to a segment view on slide four, revenue in our North American segment was down 3% sequentially as a result of weaker than expected bookings starting in Q3 of 2015 and continuing to-date. Revenue in our Core North American Careers segment was down 1%, while revenue in our MGS military business was down 10%. Mark will provide additional channel specific information in his comments. Within our portfolio, we have a number of businesses, which while significantly cash flow positive, caused a headwind to revenue growth. A good example this quarter is our newspaper channel. Revenue from this channel continues to erode on a year-over-year basis and was down $1.3 million on a year-over-year basis. In addition to being profitable, the newspaper business has a number of significant benefits, which include traffic generation and brand exposure and we are fully committed to the business. Military MGS revenue was down 10% sequentially. This decline resulted from delayed implementation of a significant piece of business and continuing challenges in our third-party education lead gen business which is primarily in our Military.com product. And we're pleased to report that the new business has subsequently been launched. As noted on the last call, we expect revenue and cash EBITDA to increase on a year-over-year basis in MGS military during 2016. The Careers International segment revenue was up 4% sequentially. Revenue in Europe was up 5% with all countries experiencing revenue growth with the strongest results coming from France and Italy. We are gratified that the plans and priorities we implemented over a year ago under the leadership of Andrea Bertone, are beginning to bear fruit in the very competitive European markets. Revenue in our APAC region, which is now mostly India, increased slightly. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for his comments. Mark Stoever - President and Chief Operating Officer Thank you, Tim, and good morning. I'll begin by characterizing our results in Q1 as a quarter of continued progress against our key 2016 operational priorities and our larger strategy of All the Jobs, All the People. This strategy has very specific goals. The first is to make Monster more effective at addressing the issues employers and individuals face in meeting career and talent challenges. The second is to leverage that capability to grow Monster share of the expanding online recruiting market. Recruiting is a rapidly evolving area deeply affected by technological and socioeconomic changes. In order to stay competitive, we must remain flexible and adapt our strategy to the current market, while anticipating the future needs of our customers. And while we still have much work to do, we are making progress and feel we have the right strategy in place to achieve our goals. Last quarter, I outlined our operational priorities for 2016. First, is the continued execution of our All the Jobs, All the People strategy driven by an effort to increase sales of our strategic products. Second, is to optimize the Core Monster business through the continued improvement of the onsite and mobile experiences we offer jobseekers and employers. Third, is to accelerate the market penetration of our pay-per-click advertising offering. And fourth, is to increase our sales productivity around the globe with a particular focus on North America. This morning, I will provide updates on the steady progress we are making on each of these initiatives. But first, I'd like to build on Tim's comments with regard to our first quarter operating results. Revenue from our strategic products continued to grow and increased in the quarter by 12% sequentially and 49% year-over-year. In the first quarter, the number of clients using our new products climbed to 6,000 in the U.S. and more than 2,800 across Europe. These products now contribute 8% of our overall revenue compared to 5% in the first quarter of 2015. We are encouraged by these developments and expect these new products to continue to be a key growth driver going forward, particularly in the second half of this year as we execute against our pay-per-click advertising more broadly. In Europe, we performed in line with our expectations, growing revenue 5% sequentially and returning to year-over-year growth. We are pleased with these results, particularly given continued economic headwinds in Europe. Our growth plan for Europe remains unchanged. We have already seen increased traction there with our new products and have made strides increasing our market competitiveness throughout the area. Beginning in the second quarter and continuing into the second half of 2016, we will strategically invest in increasing Monster's brand presence in Europe through increased marketing in a number of our key markets, specifically the U.K. and Germany, where there's near-term opportunity to accelerate business with stronger customer performance. In North America, revenue in Q1 for our Core Careers business, not including our military and government business, declined slightly overall, down 1% on a sequential basis, reflecting mixed results across our North American sales channels. Our staffing and healthcare verticals continued to grow and we showed improvement in the transactional space as a result of several 2015 initiatives designed to enhance our competitive position. Our small business segment, for example, was up sequentially and grew 20% year-over-year. In addition, e-commerce, while still down year-over-year, made progress in the quarter, growing 12% versus the prior quarter. These improvements were offset by increased churn in our overall account base, particularly among those clients where we do not enjoy a deep multi-product relationship. Strategic products continued to grow in North America and were up over 50% year-over-year. We remain focused on our goal of returning all North American channels to grow this year. Performance in our Asia business was in line with our expectations. Our key customer KPI are showing positive momentum with client retention rates improving by 11% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Our new products, such as TalentBin and more recently Social Job Ads are helping to acquire new customers resulting in 5% increase in new business sales year-over-year. In India, our Monster mobile app was honored as a product of the year in a Nielsen survey of over 7,000 consumers. Now, I'd like to update you on our progress against the operational priorities I outlined earlier. First, we're seeing success from our All the Jobs portion of the strategy and we now publish more than 5 million jobs across Monster's global job network, an increase of approximately 65% year-over-year. We've a broad and diverse population of job postings that range across a wide variety of sectors and salary levels. Our expansive network provides a significant and invaluable resource for people actively seeking job opportunities. This growth is the result of our efforts to expand job content to our major markets around the world. In fact, this quarter, we launched in key European markets, including the U.K., the Netherlands, France and Germany. We plan to have completed the work in all of our markets by the end of Q3 of this year. Expanded job content is critical to our user engagement strategy and it is a key component of our overall job advertising platform. A comprehensive job database, together with our recruitment advertising distribution network, distinguishes our platform to both seekers and employers. In addition, it provides an invaluable source of market intelligence built upon proprietary taxonomies to understand and sell against labor supply and demand information by occupation, company, and location. The improvements we've made to the Monster Recruiting platform have significantly expanded audience reach and engagement capabilities. One impactful example is the recent extension of Social Job Ads to Facebook. The Monster network today consists not just of active recruitment destinations and web distribution, but also the massive reach of social networking, making Monster the largest programmatic recruitment ad platform in the industry. Our advertisements reach nearly 2 billion people globally. No other company can provide the same reach, targeting, or automation of job ads across the Internet. Our expansion into access in Canada from social networking sites is particularly significant as we seek to engage with Millennials, who are rapidly becoming the largest portion of the workforce. According to pure research (17:28) at the end of 2015, 83% of jobseekers aged 18 years to 29 years, had looked for job information online and 79% of them had applied for a job online. The same group is highly active on social media, which drives demand for our new products, such as Monster's Social Job Ads. The proof is in the numbers. Nearly 5,000 customers have used our new Social Job Ads to-date. 90% of them have renewed following their first use. This is due to the extraordinary and unique reach and the performance of Social Job Ads. For instance, in Q1, we saw more than 55 million impressions of our job ads across social media platforms. We're pleased with the current progress on Social Job Ads and plan to launch in six new markets, Canada, France, the U.K., Netherlands, and Sweden, and Italy in Q2. The second key operational priority is to continue improving the user experience on our site. This includes optimizing site flows and a specific focus on improving job application and purchasing conversion rates. Nearly 3.2 million new members signed up for Monster Services globally this quarter. As the Monster platform evolves, we will continue to expand our capabilities and work to improve the user experience. Our improved mobile experience is an important focus area for us, as nearly half of our overall traffic comes from the mobile web. Since we introduced this new experience, we're seeing greater adoption of our mobile search with job views per (19:05) mobile search up 19% and applied starts (19:09) per mobile visit up over 11%. Across our top-tier markets which include the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, and the U.K., our organic search traffic continues to grow and was up 5% year-over-year. This was driven by ongoing improvements in organic search traffic development and overall audience acquisition effort. We have expanded our editorial content to attract and engage more users and invested in a major technical effort to restructure the core site architecture, simplifying the site structure and supporting our organic search efforts. Last quarter, we also announced the formation of a JV with kununu, a subsidiary of XING. kununu is the leading review-based employer branding and transparency platform in Europe. We will maintain a platform for employer transparency through ratings and reviews and offer employment branding through company profiles. We are early in this venture but have already compiled hundreds of thousands of reviews of companies. We know there is a significant interest from our customer base, who recognize the important role their brand plays in recruiting. They have an increasing need for help in managing their talent brand. We further believe the information from kununu will help jobseekers on the Monster platform to better understand and sign companies they might wish to work for. We expect a midyear launch of this site. Our third priority, the pay-per-click advertising model, is gaining early traction with our customers. PPC job ads are yet another example of the expansion of the Monster platform. This initiative is aligned to support customers, who have expertise in programmatic advertising and prefer a dynamic advertising budget, as well as those customers who prefer a performance-oriented purchasing model. Q1 was our first full quarter following the launch of our first customer segment and has already proven successful. Campaigns are delivering strong performance and customers are very pleased with the performance of the product, aiding in budget retention and growth. As discussed last quarter, we have launched PPC only in our recruitment advertising agency channel. These agencies are a critical part of our efforts to resell the Monster product portfolio and our work with them has helped drive strong results for the PPC platform. In the first quarter, PPC revenue increased substantially over the fourth quarter of last year, albeit, off a small base. And we have doubled the number of PPC customers in the quarter. In Q2, we will focus our PPC efforts on increasing penetration of other Monster customer channels beyond our agency partners, including direct sales to larger volume commercial enterprise customers. We expect PPC will be available in all our channels by the end of 2016. Our fourth priority is centered on increased sales productivity, particularly in North America. And we're executing on a number of initiatives that we expect will improve top line growth in 2016. In the first quarter, we invested in traditional marketing and PR efforts specifically targeted at SMB customers in the U.S. This was a national and vertically integrated radio campaign, which increased awareness, market penetration and response rates in our SMB channels. We're also transitioning from a legacy CRM platform to Salesforce.com in the second quarter. And we believe this transition will drive improved customer engagement and sales productivity in the long-term. We're focusing on improving overall average order size and customer retention rates. While we are encouraged that in several segments our average order size grew in the first quarter and believe this is the result of our continued efforts to solve the broader Monster portfolio, we are increasing our focus on customer retention to reduce churn, particularly in the tail end of the customer base, where average order size is low and churn is higher. The following actions were completed as of April 1. All commercial field roles have become hybrid focused versus separate hunters and farmers, reflecting the significant opportunity we see with our new products for both existing and new customers. We have continued our work to ensure the appropriate level of coverage is against all account sizes, enterprise, midmarket and small business. Our enterprise segment, for example, once customers who employ 500 or more employees have increased to 1,000 employees and higher for greater focus. Lastly, we've begun using the data collected from our All the Jobs strategy as demand intelligence for lead generation for our sales force. Demand data is an insight created through our new app platform, which provides supply and demand information useful in identifying, qualifying and converting prospects to new customers as well as expanding our relationships we have with existing customers. In conclusion, we are confident our strategic approach to connect people and jobs will significantly differentiate us in the market. Our focus remains on the ongoing rollout of our portfolio of products and at Monster platform-based solution-oriented approach. By casting a wide net on both sides of jobs of people, we have built an advanced recruiting platform that offers variable solutions to meet differing customer needs. While we have much work to do, we are focused on driving growth through increased customer satisfaction by reducing churn, improving our share of wallet and increasing our win rate. It remains an incredibly exciting time for the company and the industry. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Mark. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet on slide eight, during the quarter, we generated $19.5 million cash EBITDA. This cash was deployed in the following way; $10 million in capital expenditures. We would expect CapEx to range between $8 million to $10 million on a quarterly basis going forward. A repurchase of $10 million face amount of convertible notes at a discount. We believe that repurchasing these notes at a discount is a prudent use of capital, primarily because it removes a significant potential dilutive overhang, in addition, buying converts at a discount improves our leverage ratio and reduces our cash interest cost. In addition, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a value of $3 million. During the quarter as you know, we used some of our liquidity to make a one-time adjustment to our vendor management practices. This was substantially accomplished during the quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities was negative $8.6 million. The company's balance sheet remains strong. Deferred revenue was $270 million, lower as a result of less than anticipated bookings. Our capital allocation policies and actions during the first quarter remained consistent. Our policy is based on the objectives of generating an increasing amount of cash EBITDA and free cash flow, maintaining a conservative leverage ratio and maintaining the flexibility to invest in and then grow our businesses while returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter we did generate an increased amount of cash EBITDA and we used the lion's share of that to repurchase convertible notes and stock. Going forward, we will be guided in the amount of our buyback based on our actual and expected cash EBITDA and free cash flow. Q2 will be a quarter in which we continue to stabilize and make our revenue and continue to make progress which will allow us to achieve top line growth. During the second quarter, we expect cash EBITDA to be in the range of $13 million to $18 million. The reduction from Q1 is largely the result of the incremental European marketing spend, which Mark discussed in his comments. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be between $15 million to $20 million and we would expect pro forma earnings per share to be between breakeven and $0.04. Looking at the full year, we continue to guide to cash EBITDA of $85 million to $100 million. As mentioned on last quarter's call, this level of profitability will represent a significant increase over 2015 and will allow us to invest in initiatives which we believe will drive top line growth. As we look at revenue for the full year, while we remain completely committed to driving full year revenue growth that is getting increasingly difficult to achieve. There are a couple of reasons why this is the case. First, is the fact that North American bookings for Q1 and now as we anticipate for Q2, are below our original plan. As you know, this has a direct impact on our revenue for the back half of the year. Second, and we believe you have seen much the same commentary from some of our traditional competitors, we continue to compete aggressively to retain and strengthen our client base, particularly in the job posting part of our business. While our volume of business continues to be up, the price remains highly competitive and this, of course, has a negative impact on our revenue. For the last several quarters, revenue has stabilized. We remain confident that we would be able to grow revenue year-over-year in at least mid-single digits to low single digits in Q4 of this year, which will set us up very well for the subsequent revenue growth. All of us at Monster are completely committed to growing our business. In this dynamic and increasingly competitive market, we believe that we have stabilized our competitive position against our more traditional competitors and that our strategy makes us increasingly competitive against newer competitors. Our job aggregation strategy, combined with a PPC model, makes us much more competitive against job aggregators. Our expanded ability to generate current profiles for both passive and active seekers makes us more competitors who are focused largely on the upper end of the passive seeker market. We have the people and financial resources and the grit to stay the course and continue to execute our strategy. Operator, please open the line for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Kara Anderson of B. Riley & Company. Please go ahead. Kara L. Anderson - B. Riley & Co. LLC Hi, good morning. Just wondering if you could go over sort of your expectations for cash EBITDA for the back half of the year with Q1 behind us and Q2 guidance, it seems like it's heavily weighted towards the last two quarters. And wanted to know if that's due to the acceleration in revenues you expect in Q4 or a pullback on some of the spending that you're doing? Thanks. Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Largely because of expected stabilization of revenue now and then increase in revenue in the back half of the year. Kara L. Anderson - B. Riley & Co. LLC Great. Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer We're not currently anticipating substantial expense reductions. Kara L. Anderson - B. Riley & Co. LLC Okay. And then in the quarter, you spoke about some separation charges related to head count reductions, wondering if you could expand on that? Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yes, there's a little bit of continuing as I think we've mentioned, we've significantly changed the management in the U.S. sales force. That's a component of it and then as I noted in my comments, there were some advisory fees, which are not normal part of our business. Kara L. Anderson - B. Riley & Co. LLC I'll let someone else jump in. Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Kara. Operator The next question is from Tracy Young of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Tracy Young - Evercore ISI Yes. Hi. Just on the MGS business, could you talk about how that's trending for Q2 and when did you start to see weakness there? Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Well, we think we mentioned last quarter, Tracy, over the last two years, really, the revenue and the profitability of our MGS military business has come down significantly as a percentage. And it represents – it has been a drag on the consolidated North American business. And that came because the business had grown very rapidly. Then, as I think, we reported, we had a couple of customer issues. We had a – although, it's not directly in North America, we worked out the issue we had in the U.K. with one of our significant pieces of business in the U.K. So, it began to stabilize. The business came down over the last two years, began to stabilize in the back half of 2015 and is anticipated to be growing revenue and profitability during 2016. So, it no longer would be a drag on the rest of the North American business, but we'll be adding to it from a growth perspective. And in terms of the backlog building, we have a number of significant deals in the backlog. As you know, we've always used the word, lumpy, for this business. The bookings are lumpy. The revenue is relatively consistent over time. But there are a couple of significant opportunities we have out there. Tracy Young - Evercore ISI Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question is from Benjamin Flox of Avondale Partners. Please go ahead. Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC Hey, guys, Ben Flox on for Randy Reece. Looking at Careers North America, can you give a sense of how all non-employment revenue performed in the quarter and then also speak to the employment-related revenue as well? Mark Stoever - President and Chief Operating Officer Yes, Ben. It's Mark. So the non-employment revenue, I think you're referring to our advertising business? Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC Yes. That's right. Mark Stoever - President and Chief Operating Officer Our display business continues to do quite well. In fact, it's offsetting some of the pressure Tim mentioned with respect to our education lead gen business on Military.com. So I would say that we continue to do well with advertising on the site, particularly with our sites like Fastweb, where we can provide a very unique audience and are able to monetize the inventory pretty robustly versus, perhaps, on Monster, where as you know historically we want to continue to be very focused on making sure we're balancing the user experience, who's trying to look for a job. And we want to convert that individual into as many job applies as possible. You want to make sure we're not cluttering up the site. So, I feel good that we're balancing it the right way and we're improving. We'll still be challenged a bit on the lead gen side, as you know, as continued regulation and limitations are being placed on that, we're looking for ways to offset the business. Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC Okay. When you say improving, are you referring to sequential growth or year-over-year growth? Is there any way to parse that out? Mark Stoever - President and Chief Operating Officer On the display side, both sequentially and year-over-year. Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC Nice. Okay. And then again on Careers North America, would you say price competition is the biggest issue or are there other factors driving attrition? Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer I think we feel that it's 2/3 price competition, 1/3 probably our own internal with a little bit of macro overhang on it. And I would not blame macro overhang, but I think the world is not as robust as the headline employment statistics would indicate. Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC Okay. Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer So, majority I would say, we're fighting it out. We have a good value proposition, it's getting stronger. There is a lot of competition, because I think as you know over time there have been waves of competition which we adjust to and we end up holding our own and that's our plan this time. Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC Okay. And actually can I jump back to my initial question. Can you give an amount for ad revenue in Careers North America? Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer No, we're not really disclosing – breaking that out. Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC Okay. Figured, I'd ask. Thanks, guys. That's all I got. Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thank you. Operator This concludes our question-and-answer question.

Looking at Careers North America, can you give a sense of how all non-employment revenue performed in the quarter and then also speak to the employment-related revenue as well? Mark Stoever - President and Chief Operating Officer Yes, Ben. It's Mark. So the non-employment revenue, I think you're referring to our advertising business? Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC Yes. That's right. Mark Stoever - President and Chief Operating Officer Our display business continues to do quite well. In fact, it's offsetting some of the pressure Tim mentioned with respect to our education lead gen business on Military.com. So I would say that we continue to do well with advertising on the site, particularly with our sites like Fastweb, where we can provide a very unique audience and are able to monetize the inventory pretty robustly versus, perhaps, on Monster, where as you know historically we want to continue to be very focused on making sure we're balancing the user experience, who's trying to look for a job. And we want to convert that individual into as many job applies as possible. You want to make sure we're not cluttering up the site. So, I feel good that we're balancing it the right way and we're improving. We'll still be challenged a bit on the lead gen side, as you know, as continued regulation and limitations are being placed on that, we're looking for ways to offset the business. Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC Okay. When you say improving, are you referring to sequential growth or year-over-year growth? Is there any way to parse that out? Mark Stoever - President and Chief Operating Officer On the display side, both sequentially and year-over-year. Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC Nice. Okay. And then again on Careers North America, would you say price competition is the biggest issue or are there other factors driving attrition? Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer I think we feel that it's 2/3 price competition, 1/3 probably our own internal with a little bit of macro overhang on it. And I would not blame macro overhang, but I think the world is not as robust as the headline employment statistics would indicate. Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC Okay. Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer So, majority I would say, we're fighting it out. We have a good value proposition, it's getting stronger. There is a lot of competition, because I think as you know over time there have been waves of competition which we adjust to and we end up holding our own and that's our plan this time. Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC Okay. And actually can I jump back to my initial question. Can you give an amount for ad revenue in Careers North America? Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer No, we're not really disclosing – breaking that out. Ben Flox - Avondale Partners LLC Okay. Figured, I'd ask. Thanks, guys. That's all I got. Timothy T. Yates - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thank you. Operator This concludes our question-and-answer question. And I'd like to turn the conference back over to Bob Jones for any closing remarks. Bob Jones - Primary IR Contact, Monster Worldwide, Inc. Once again, thank you for your time this morning and your interest in Monster Worldwide. Management will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you and have a good day.

Kiddoo Thanks Kathy. Before I discuss the details of our results, I would like to highlight that our revenue guidance for the June quarter includes $15 million to $20 million of revenue due to the start of the transition to sell-in revenue accounting for distribution. The split of this revenue is roughly a half in the industrial market, a third in the comm market and the remaining portion across the other end markets. Overall, we continue to successfully execute on our business transformation. Our third quarter revenue results were above the midpoint of our guidance, above typical seasonality and up 5% from the same quarter a year ago. Our guidance for the fourth quarter is up sequentially and strongly up from the same quarter a year ago. We achieved our 65% gross margin target ahead of schedule in Q3 and expect to be able to sustain this high quality of earnings in the coming quarters. The improvements in our revenue growth have been driven by content gains in our automotive business, growth in factory automation and core industrial products and diversification across a broad base of customers, platforms and technologies in consumers. With that, let me discuss Maxim's third quarter financial results. Revenue for the third quarter was $581 million, up 5% from the second quarter and above the $575 million, midpoint of our guidance. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q3 was approximately 28% from industrial, 26% consumer, 21% comm and data center, 21% automotive and 4% computing. It is worth highlighting that industrial is now our largest business and that industrial plus automotive is nearly 50% of total Company revenue. Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 42% of Maxim's revenue in the March quarter, a record-high percentage for Maxim. Resales were down sequentially and end market bookings were flat. We ended Q3 with 63 days of inventory in the distribution channel, up six days from Q2. The increase in days was driven by lower resales, particularly at the start of Q3 during the winter holiday season. However, the resales trend improved as we progressed through Q3 and we are forecasting strong resales in Q4. Turning to the P&L, Maxim's gross margin excluding special items was 65.2%, an increase of over 100 basis points from the prior quarter, driven by strong operational execution on our manufacturing transformation. We closed the Dallas bump fab, as planned, within the quarter. Special items in Q3 gross margin included intangible asset amortization from acquisitions and accelerated depreciation. Operating expenses excluding special items were $187 million, up slightly from the prior quarter due to higher employee profit-sharing, partially offset by continued cost controls, consistent with our operational plan. Special items in Q3 operating expenses included acquisition related charges and restructuring charges. Q3 GAAP operating income excluding special items was $192 million. Operating margin at 33% of revenue is significantly up from the prior quarter and is up from 27% in the same quarter a year ago. The 500 basis point improvement in operating margin over the same quarter last year was driven by our manufacturing transformation and focused R&D investment strategy. Q3 GAAP tax rate excluding special items was 15%. GAAP earnings per share excluding special items was $0.56, above the high end of our guided range and up 37% from the same quarter a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, during the quarter, cash flow from operations was $221 million, or 38% of revenue. Inventory days ended at 109, flat from Q2. Inventory dollars were up 2% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $8 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures are well below our normalized level of $26 million per quarter of depreciation. Trailing 12-month free cash flow ending Q3 using net capital expenditures was $819 million or 36% of revenue and up 20% over the same quarter last year. Our free cash flow yield is approximately 6% at yesterday's closing stock price. For capital returned, share repurchases totaled $57 million in Q3 as we bought back approximately 1.3 million shares. Dividends totaled $93 million in the quarter or $0.33 per share. The dividend yield is approximately 3% at yesterday's closing stock price. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $69 million in the [second] [ph] quarter to $2.16 billion. Moving on to guidance, our beginning Q4 backlog was $382 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q4 revenue of $590 million to $630 million. This includes the $15 million to $20 million due to the start of the transition to sell-in revenue accounting for distribution. As our guidance indicates, Q4 revenues are expected to be up sequentially and strongly up from the same quarter last year, driven by automotive and industrial and revenue diversification in consumer. Q4 gross margin excluding special items is forecasted at 65% to 67%, benefiting from continued execution of our manufacturing transformation and higher distribution revenue. Special items in Q4 gross margin are estimated at approximately $11 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Q4 operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be flat to the prior quarter with continued cost controls offsetting higher profit-sharing accruals. Special items in Q4 operating expenses are estimated at approximately $2 million, primarily for amortization of intangible assets. Our tax rate for Q4 excluding special items will be 15%, flat from Q3. We expect this rate to be applicable for the remainder of this fiscal year and for fiscal year 2018. Our Q4 GAAP earnings per share excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.59 to $0.65. For fiscal year 2017, gross capital expenditures are expected to be within the target range of 1% to 3% of revenue. And finally, we expect buybacks in Q4 to be consistent with our annual commitment to return 80% of free cash flow to shareholders. In summary, we expect Q4 revenue to be up sequentially and strongly up from the same quarter last year. We are diversifying our revenue profile in consumer and growing content in automotive and industrial, which is helping to lower variability, and we are achieving our profitability in free cash flow targets ahead of schedule. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tunc. Tunc Doluca Thank you, Bruce. Good afternoon to all the participants on the call. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated and thank you for joining us today. Our strong growth in the March quarter enabled us to exceed our revenue and profitability targets. This momentum was led by automotive and industrial growth, relative to the March quarter of last year. Our return to growth and strong profitability confirms that our R&D investment strategy and manufacturing transformation are on track and delivering great results. Let me discuss our business. First, I will comment on automotive. Our automotive business delivered exceptional results in the March quarter, growing 13% sequentially and up 26% from the same quarter last year. Our most significant incremental revenue continues to come from infotainment content. Our highly efficient power management products for infotainment applications enabled us to strengthen customer relationships in automotive and earn new design wins for our Serial Link USB and LED lighting products. In the quarter, we saw a flurry of activity by customers to architect the car of the future. Car manufacturers are exploring alternative uses of our Serial Link products to move vast amounts of data within the car. They are finding ways to use our high-speed Serial Link technology to connect head units to vision cameras, radar, LIDAR and remote tuner systems. In the next few years, we expect to generate significant Serial Link business serving infotainment and driver assistance applications at multiple customers. In addition, during the quarter we recognized new design wins for battery management systems for electric vehicles, primarily from our European customer base. Our June guidance for automotive reflects the following. First, our March quarter revenue results were exceptionally strong and provide a larger base for sequential comparisons. Second, changes in government incentives for electric vehicles are weakening China battery management product demand. Third, we are seeing signs of the weaker auto market in the U.S. As a result, we expect our June quarter automotive business to be sequentially flat from a very strong March quarter, and strongly up from the same quarter last year. Let me next turn to the industrial market. Our March quarter industrial business was strongly up from the same quarter last year, and normalizing for the sale of our energy meter business, our industrial business was up double digits. Within industrial, the core segment was also strongly up from the same quarter last year, driven primarily by factory automation products in the areas of interface and power management. Strong growth in factory automation has delivered year-over-year increases in our core industrial business for the last four quarters, and drove 16% sequential growth in the March quarter, well above seasonality. We expect growth to continue in core industrial. As factories are modernized, our IO-Link solutions enable direct network access to sensors on the factory floor using existing cabling. A major Japanese automotive manufacturer has recently decided to implement sensors within its worldwide plants using Maxim's factory automation solutions, including our family of IO-Link products. IO-Link adds data transmission and communication capabilities to devices such as sensors and actuators. This is a critical capability as manufacturers implement flexible and distributed process control at the robot level in modern factories. In the June quarter, we expect industrial to be up sequentially, with modest growth from a very strong March quarter and the balance driven by the transition to sell-in revenue accounting that Bruce mentioned earlier. Core industrial, with particular strength in factory automation content, remains the strongest contributor to our expected growth. Together, automotive and industrial markets contributed 49% of total Company revenue in the March quarter. Let me discuss communications and data center next. In the March quarter, communications and data center was flat compared to the same quarter last year. Revenue was up strongly sequentially. Growth in the same market is led by data center with strong customer adoption of our 100G optical products used in high-speed data center applications. We saw good sequential growth in the communications infrastructure as well. We expect continued momentum in 100G optical products. We also expect the communications infrastructure market to be up sequentially across a broad base of products. Part of this increase is driven by the transition to sell-in revenue accounting. Finally, let me turn to consumer. In the March quarter, our consumer business was sequentially down with lower content in smartphones, as expected. Our business at Samsung was below 10% of Company revenue. March consumer revenue was better than expected due to a broader revenue base. In the June quarter, we expect consumer to be up sequentially, with decreasing revenue from smartphones more than offset by strong growth in wearables, tablets, peripherals and gaming products. We continue to see new opportunities in consumer products such as hearables and wearables. These emerging areas play to our technology strengths in power management, audio, sensors and low-power micros. We expect to benefit from this diversification in the June quarter. In closing, our performance demonstrates that our strategy to grow our revenue is working. Our automotive business continues to grow strongly. New factory automation applications are enabling multiple consecutive quarters of significant year-over-year growth in our core industrial business. We are growing our 100G optical business within data center applications and making excellent progress in diversifying our consumer revenue in wearables, tablets, peripherals and gaming systems. Our growth is enabling us to approach our profitability goals that we established two years ago when we embarked on our manufacturing transformation and focused R&D initiatives. Our revenue growth, greater profitability and growing cash flow enable us to remain a leader in the return of capital to shareholders and to maximize shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Kathy. Kathy Ta Thanks Tunc. That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open the call for questions. We would like to continue the same Q&A process as we used last quarter. We will take one question from each caller, so we can get to more people in the queue. If you have more than one question, please go back into the queue. We will try to get to as many of you as possible. Jonathan, could we please have our first question? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan. Your question please? Harlan Sur Congratulations on the solid results and the outlook. On the better gross margins, 100 basis points better than guide for the March quarter, and another 100 basis points step-up here in June, question is, how much of that is due to the Dallas bump fab closure and how much of that is just due to kind of higher levels of revenues and/or other efficiencies? And is the June gross margin reflective of all the manufacturing cost initiatives that you've outlined or is there still more of that on the come? Thank you. Bruce E. Kiddoo Harlan, this is Bruce. I'll take that. So the Q3 gross margin of 65.2%, we hit our long-term goal there. That really had no benefit from Dallas, right. That kind of closed at the end of the quarter. So we didn't see any benefit from that. It was basically just continued blocking and tackling, right, the benefits of the transformation that we've done, the continued improved utilization at our remaining internal fab, and just kind of cost controls across the board. I will say, it came in a little better than we had originally anticipated. Part of that was just execution and part of that there is always a lot of factors that sort of flip both ways and sort of more than less kind of came up on the positive side this time. So we did have some benefits there. That said, we continue to forecast very strong gross margin for Q4, kind of the midpoint of 66% gross margin. Again, that continues just to sort of benefit from this ongoing transformation. I think once you change the culture and you get the momentum around kind of controlling costs, I think you continue to see that beyond what we initially expected. We will get a little benefit as well from the shift to sell-in. But it's clearly up even without that benefit. So your final question as far as, is there still more? I don't think we've seen the full benefit of Dallas. That said, in addition to that, we have some other long-term tailwinds that we have talked about in the past, the most significant of which is this kind of convergence of depreciation to CapEx. In Q3, kind of the normalized depreciation was $26 million in the quarter and CapEx was $8 million. That's a little low, right. If you think of kind of the midpoint of our range of 2%, say you're going to be at $12 million or $13 million a quarter. That's still a substantial gap to close. That's going to happen over multiple years, but that will be a nice tailwind for us. We're also going to have the benefit as we kind of work through the long-term supply agreement we have with TowerJazz for our ex San Antonio fab. That allows us to kind of the take or pay goes down and we can now move more so that we can get better loading at our internal fab and some of our other boundaries. And so that's a benefit. And then finally, industrial being our largest business now, distribution revenue at the highest it's ever been at 42% of revenue, and this is in March, this has no benefit of the shift in sell-in. So that's just kind of straight up benefit there. So, normally mix isn't a big part of what drives our gross margin, but I think long-term this shift where industrial and distribution are becoming large portions of our business will help from a tailwind as well. So, I mean I think we feel good on gross margin, I think we have worked very hard to execute and it's starting to flow through the P&L and driving EPS and cash flow. Harlan Sur Great execution. Thanks Bruce. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question please? Ross Seymore Just wanted to follow up on the sell-in change, Bruce, if you could just walk through conceptually what the implications are for the revenue side of the equation and for the gross margin side of the equation as we get into the September quarter, because is it one that the June quarter was elevated in a couple of areas and that's a one-time benefit or is there some additional sell-in revenue recognition that has to work its way through into September? Bruce E. Kiddoo Sure. So this is the start of the transition. Just to remind folks on the call and investors listening, the U.S. was generally on a sell-through basis, North America was on a sell-through basis and our international distributors wire on a sell-in basis. As we have gone through, this year we have focused a lot on our sales transformation and being able to sell to the broad market, and so we have put a lot of effort into kind of transforming our distribution business. And as part of that, we sort of looked at what are the terms that we offer, and in looking at our North America business, kind of from just applying GAAP and kind of the way we transformed our business, the shift to sell-in is more appropriate. And so, we had two main distributors in North America. One is shifting out because of kind of the way the terms fit and confidence in the reporting systems that we get from them, and so we are doing that one this quarter. We said that's the $15 million to $20 million of benefit this quarter. That will not repeat in Q1. So we need to make sure folks out there doing their models don't just start off that higher base. That said, to be very clear, this is revenue that we earned. It was on the balance sheet. We were going to recognize it eventually. So this is, it is real revenue, it should count against if you look at kind of annualized revenue and EPS, from that point of view. This is distribution business, so it's above the corporate average gross margin. And so, as I kind of indicated to Harlan's question, there is some benefit in the June quarter from that. That said, sort of kind of the ongoing benefits of our transformation in gross margin, we expect gross margin to continue to remain very strong. And so from that point of view, I mean there is always puts and takes, but I think there will be sort of, when we look at September, clearly the revenue will not benefit from that, but I think from a gross margin point of view, I think you will see less impact from that point of view. So does that answer your question, Ross? Ross Seymore Yes. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your question please? Ambrish Srivastava I wanted to focus on the auto business, and Tunc, as always you guys are very transparent. What was going to be my first question, the year-over-year growth, and you guys have done a fantastic job in growing the auto business, but the year-over-year growth is decelerating, and you talked about China as well as the U.S. slowdown. To my knowledge, first time at least I'm hearing a company talk about a slowdown which has been feared by investors and everybody for a while. Can you please talk about the visibility that you have, do you expect the year-over-year to decel as we go through the next couple of quarters or you think this is something that you don't have a lot of visibility in, or how should we think about it? Thank you. Tunc Doluca Thanks for that question. I think it is something that we did want to talk about in more detail, so you asking it is great. So essentially just to recap, automotive did have a very strong Q3. It was up 26% year-over-year. And if you really take a look at Q3 plus Q4, or half year, combined we are still up in the high teens year-over-year despite the fact that we guided flat for Q4. Now having said that, we obviously take a good close look at what happened here and we outlined some of the other reasons other than this great quarter we had in Q3, and we do see this weakness in BMS in China. This has been lumpy business in the past, but it has grown for us now. So it's got a bigger effect on the overall automotive revenue. And it really is determined in a large part by incentives that the government puts in place. So it is pretty hard for us to actually predict that frankly. The rest of our BMS business is a lot more stable, the ones coming from other regions, but this one really depends on how those incentives are put in place. Now long term, despite the lumpiness, we think there are some underlying reasons in China, mostly about pollution in the air, that will drive more electric vehicles and I think the government will continue to incentivize it. But I think the decisions come out in discrete form which affects demand. So that's one piece. The other piece is, I think as many of you following the auto business have followed, in the U.S. we did notice some softness in sales, and just looking at our product sales into that market, we are seeing that to be weaker than the other regions. So those are I think the two, other than the strength we had last quarter, are the two things we see fundamentally. However, the fundamentals continue to be strong for us. The design win pipeline forecast is very robust for infotainment and ADAS and electric vehicles as well. So we do expect this business to grow in the future in the double digits range for multiple years. But my experience in the past has always been that you never grow in a straight line, frankly, and I think we're just seeing a temporary effect in this quarter. But long-term, we like this business. I think most of our investors like it because it's sticky, it's stable, the sockets are there for multiple years, and no fundamentals have changed in the last quarter. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your question please? Tore Svanberg Congratulations on the results. Bruce, you talked about sell-through being a little bit weak earlier in the quarter and then it kind of strengthened, and then you're expecting I think you said pretty strong sell-through in the June quarter. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that please? Bruce E. Kiddoo So I think when we look at the third quarter, I thank we indicated resales were down sequentially, they were down 3%, which is basically in line with seasonality, maybe just one or two points weaker than seasonality. If you sort of look at that by geography, I think for us, and it's been a similar story the last couple of quarters, the Americas has been weak and it continues to be weak. And so that's just an issue that we are continuing to work on and to address. I would say, China and Japan were kind of in line with seasonality, and these are kind of normally some – resales are a little bit slower for both of those countries. EMEA was actually up strongly, which normally is again in line with seasonality. So I think the main weakness there in the third quarter was really the Americas, and I think everybody else was kind of as expected. When we do look forward to Q4, we are seeing very strong resale forecast. Again, when we look at the different countries, both probably led by Japan, as we have had good business there with some of our gaming opportunities, some of the automotive, so that's done well, and then we are also seeing sort of some expected strength in Europe and China as well. So, overall I think we are comfortable with kind of where we are at in the channel. We did see a slight uptick in the days, and so our target is at 55 to 60, we are at 62, and with the expectation for strong resales in the June quarter, I think we are comfortable with where we are sitting there. Basically the inventory is a couple of days above our target, but really in expectation of strong resales this quarter. Tore Svanberg Very helpful. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please? Vivek Arya Tunc, I'm wondering, in terms of use of cash, do you think either from a Maxim or if you could comment from an overall industry perspective, are we at a plateau in semis M&A or do you see additional consolidation potential in the industry beyond just small tuck-in deals? Because when I look at Maxim, your core business has stabilized, it's doing quite well. The consumer headwinds have sort of reversed and gross margins are definitely tracking better than expectations. So what will be the trigger for you to consider additional M&A and take advantage of your very strong balance sheet? Thank you. Tunc Doluca So, I mean we look at all possible ways to grow cash flows in the Company. Obviously the organic ones are ones that are completely in our control, and as you noted, we made a bunch of changes that made us stronger as a company. But one of the levers that we always have is to look at whether we can grow by acquiring other assets as well. But we also have some guidelines as to how we want to do that, and frankly, we wanted to be close to what we know how to run, which is businesses, analog and mixed-signal. We need any asset that we acquire, when we acquire it to be at least be able to get to the margin structure that we have as a company. And third is [indiscernible] our pick. So we look at what is the ROI in that investment. And we always have our eyes open. And that's one of the reasons why we do want a reasonable amount of capability or capacity to be able to do that. Having said all that, your other question is, will the M&A continue? I think that you opened up with that. And I think it will because the semiconductor industry is not growing as fast as it used to in the past. So I think everybody has criteria probably similar to what Maxim has, and that will probably in my view kind of slow things down a bit, but I think that in general, as long as debt is cheap, I think everybody is kind of looking at this as a growth opportunity. But we want to make sure that we are also very careful in our decisions in terms of growing with acquisition. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie Securities. Your question please? Srini Pajjuri Bruce, I just want to go back to the gross margin optimism that you commented about. Obviously you said the distribution is helping gross margins a bit. Just want to understand if you're seeing any better pricing trends given all the consolidation? I do look at the SA data and it doesn't seem like there is an evidence that pricing is getting any better, but I just want to hear your thoughts. Thank you. Bruce E. Kiddoo I think it kind of ties with the prior question around consolidation, and I think as our industry consolidates and there is just less semiconductor companies, I do think there are benefits across the board to margin, and whether that's in dealings with our suppliers or distributors or customers. And so, I think from that point of view, I think there is the opportunity to kind of fully capture value for the products that we sell. I think that's always been our goal and I think it's always a negotiation. And as far as how much of that value we keep versus our customers get to capture from us, and I think to the extent that consolidation is occurring, I think that that's helpful to us from a pricing point of view. It's not something that we look at as some short-term opportunity. We think this is something that we obviously kind of have strategic partnerships with our customers. But over a long term, we do think that's probably another tailwind to gross margin. I would say it's more subtle and it's not one we'll all be able to call out at some point in time and say, hey, we are up 50 bps because of pricing, I think it's more, I think it provides, in my sense the best way to characterize, as an underlying support for our gross margin. Whereas in the past I think chip companies were always having to sort of offset pricing reductions and I think that pressure probably abated a little bit. Tunc Doluca So just for me to add to that, I think most of the companies that are higher-quality companies have gotten a lot more disciplined on this, and I think that that helps. But as Bruce said, it's going to be difficult for us and for many other companies to say, we got this margin because we were able to get better control of prices. Very subtle and slow and distributed over many, many products. Operator Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question please? John Pitzer Bruce, I'm not sure if you mentioned when your second distributor in the U.S. is going to move to a sell-in. Could you help us understand when that might happen and would you expect sort of an equal amount? I guess just in general, as you think about sell-in versus sell-through, sell-in tends to create more volatility than sell-through in rev rec. And so, are you guys thinking about your own inventory levels differently as you try to manage a sell-in rev rec model versus a sell-through rev rec model or how should I think about that? Bruce E. Kiddoo So your first question, obviously we'll transition it when it's appropriate to transition, and this is more based on sort of kind of application of the accounting rules, from that point of view. My sense is, it's highly likely it will be in FY 2018, and if I had to do an over/under, it's probably more likely to be in the first half of FY 2018 than the second half. But that hasn't been determined yet, right, and that's something we continue to evaluate every quarter from that point of view as far as what is the proper accounting for that. As far as the transition to sell-in on a global basis, certainly it's something that as a CFO makes me a little bit nervous. We are very transparent on what our channel inventory is. We are very transparent on what our goals are and it's something we manage very closely internally to make sure that we stayed disciplined there and that we don't build up too much, or to be clear that we don't have too little out there as well, right. We believe, the ability of our distribution partners to have inventory to support small customers is important. So getting that, kind of from an asset management point of view, getting the right level and candidly the right products in distribution I think is important to it. And as far as your last question on our thoughts on our own inventory process, again I don't think that the difference between sell-in to sell-through changes that much from kind of any buffer inventories that we carry in our books. Obviously to the extent that we are selling into distribution, we expect them to carry the buffer. And so from that point of view, that's not a key area of our buffer plans for us. And then I guess finally, I think you also asked about the magnitude. Most likely it will be larger, maybe 50% or more larger than what we are currently looking at. John Pitzer That's helpful, Bruce. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of C. J. Muse from Evercore. Your question please? Christopher J. Muse I guess for my question I was hoping perhaps you could quantify expected growth in the consumer segment? If my math is right, it sounds like it's in high single digits. And then I guess, would love to hear your thoughts how you're thinking about seasonality into the second half of the year, particularly as it relates to your largest customer. Thanks. Tunc Doluca Okay, so I'll take that one. So in terms of seasonality or providing forecast for longer than a quarter, we haven't been doing that for a while and we really don't want to do it. The visibility is really not that clear, especially in consumer into that space. And your question was about consumer growth, and I do want to answer that. I mean in the short term, our goal is really to simply stabilize our consumer revenue. And the mechanism we are using for that is to get diversification, as Bruce and I mentioned, by winning in end equipment other than smartphones and winning in wearables and some hearables, tablets, gaming, all kinds of other things, and also wining at other customers, even in the smartphone space, to be able to diversify that. So, I think the way to think about it in the short term is to see if we can really make it not go down, like it used to in the past. We have made great progress in that space last year. And I think that our ability to diversify the business is going to help us also in terms of stabilizing it. But I think we won't be able to give any guidance for next quarter or next year. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your question please? Craig Hettenbach Tunc, appreciate all the color on the automotive market. Just maybe taking that a step further when you think about some of the very near term headwinds, anything from a change of customers in terms of build plans or how are they kind of reacting to if you call it kind of a mild slowdown for parts of the automotive business? Tunc Doluca Frankly, when we are looking into our guidance numbers and if we are trying to make some sense out of it, what we found is really nothing that was really very obvious frankly. I mean it took us a while to dig in and figure out the answers. So we are not really seeing some big signal from any sector that says there is a big slowdown going on, other than China. I think in China the incentive thing was pretty obvious and it was one of the important things that we saw right away. So, I'm afraid we are not going to be able to give a lot more insight into what's going on overall in the automotive market, and I think our information is kind of it is filtered through too many layers before it gets to us, because most of our sales are into Tier 1s and they sell into multiple regions. So it's not very easy to get the information you are asking for. Bruce E. Kiddoo Yes, I guess the good news about our automotive business has been it's broadly diversified and we sell across, as Tunc said, multiple Tier 1s and some OEMs across multiple regions with multiple products. That's what makes it a very nice business. It's like the old industrial business that was always a great business and is still a great business, but very difficult to articulate exactly what's causing that business to go up or down in the short term. But of course that's why, A, it's a great long-term business for us, and B, while we have the confidence that while there is always going to be some kind of quarterly variations, as Tunc said, long-term we are still highly confident that this will be a very strong growth business for us for many years to come. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danley from Citigroup. Your question please? Christopher Danley Just a little more clarification on the auto slowdown, so when did the slowdown start, was it push-out to cancellations, do you think it can get worse, and then do you think things will be back to normal by next quarter? Tunc Doluca So I mean we didn't really see any signs that were like a big push-out or a cancellation or anything like that. It's just from the information that we were getting in giving or looking at what the revenue is going to look like for the current quarter, it looked like there is – we had such good growth in the previous quarter, I think that's really the biggest effect here compared to all the other ones we talked about. And if you kind of do a moving average, we are still on a really nice growth curve and we have no reason to believe that that moving average has suddenly had a big change in slope. So, no – I understand what you are asking, you're saying, was it some big events that occurred, and that is not the case. Bruce E. Kiddoo If anything, we had a tremendous quarter. Christopher Danley Okay. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question please? Toshiya Hari I wanted to follow up on gross margins. Bruce, when you think about your business over the next couple of years in terms of manufacturing footprint, business mix, customer concentration or diversification, is the mid 60s to high 60% range kind of the new steady-state or do you think you can aim for 70% or higher on a multi-year basis? Thank you. Bruce E. Kiddoo So, we are doing really well on gross margins, and we set a goal to go from kind of 60%-61% to 65%. I think the Company executed phenomenally and I think we got to our 65% and we got there earlier than we thought. We clearly are now guiding to something above that and we believe there's tailwinds that will help us and support our gross margin going forward. That said, I don't think we're prepared to update the model from a commitment point of view. I think we'll continue to evaluate this. We are kind of going through our planting season right now. Our fiscal year ends in June. And so we'll get a good sense of what that gross margin looks like out for the next three years. I mean right now, we're just focused on execution and delivering kind of the best gross margin we can, and I think when it's appropriate, we'll look to update the model. But for now, I think we're just going to continue to execute and I think we'll continue to be able to deliver gross margins in the range we're at now. Toshiya Hari Got it. Thanks so much. Operator Our next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo. Your question please? David Wong Bruce, you ran through roughly how the extra revenue from the change to sell-in recognition was divided amongst your various end market segments. Can you give us some idea of what the year-over-year growth numbers look like by segment, if we back out this transition? Bruce E. Kiddoo I have about 20 pieces of paper in front of me and I don't have that piece of paper in front of me. So we'll get back to you. I don't have that. David Wong Okay, fine, thanks. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chin from UBS. Your question please? Steven Chin I had one on the comm and data center business, if I could, just given some of the benefits from the distributor sell-in revenue recognition for that division, could you possibly provide a little more color on how that segment might be performing for this June quarter if you were to back out that sell-in benefit? And also, specific to the comm infrastructure portion, how is I guess the overall demand or inventory levels for that part of your business, because I know that can be lumpy, and given some of the I guess downward bias in telco CapEx I think in China and even here in Verizon recently, if you're seeing any effects of that? Thank you. Bruce E. Kiddoo I'll answer the numbers and I'll let Tunc give the color on the business. As far as I mean we are guiding our kind of comm and data center business up in Q4, the change to sell-in doesn't have changed that. If we hadn't had that, it would be up as well. So from that point of view, there is no qualitative change in our guidance. As far as your other questions, Tunc? Tunc Doluca So in the near term, we did project comms and data center to be up quarter over quarter and we do see growth both in the optical data center side and the infrastructure side, both of them. Your question about lumpiness certainly is true for the comms infrastructure side of the business and we don't really have enough of an exposure to be able to tell what the inventory levels are at our customers. Obviously we know what it is at our distributors. And we are not aware of issues there. But we don't know what it is at the customers. Over the long term, the biggest growth driver for us is going to be on the cloud data center side of this business. I think we have talked about in the past about our investments, especially on the optical data communications within a data center application, and that business is doing really well. This is the 100G gigabit per second connectivity business we've had. It's been a great business for us because we've made the right decisions on architecture and how to help our customers design the modules for this, especially on the laser driver side, and we are confident that we're going to see a transition to 100G because it's faster speed and better, lower power consumption for these systems. And we are really at the early innings in that growth. I mean we began to see demand starting back in the December quarter and now we are seeing continued growth and we continue to see year-over-year growth in optical. So I think that that one is really a transition from lower frequency to higher frequency in a market that's already growing. So that's all helping us and giving us a lot of tailwind in this data center and comms business. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Your question please? Christopher Rolland Just to follow up on auto again, and once again congrats on another great quarter there and what's been a really terrific year, in your last Analyst Day you said that that segment will grow 2x the overall auto market, but there is some belief that SAR could be flat or even modestly down this year, so that rule of thumb kind of breaks down. So I guess my first question is, on a flat SAR, what do you think we could do for auto? Is the double-digit scenario that you alluded to still achievable there? And then secondly, if the SAR does decline, it's probably because of the lack of subsidies in China. Do you guys happen to know your NGO exposure? I know it can be tough, but do you know China versus EU versus North America for example? Tunc Doluca Okay, so that's a lot of questions in there, but let me just tell you what we said and then we can get back into the question you were asking. So basically, at our Investor Day, which was a little bit over a year ago, and at investor meetings that we've had, at various conferences, we've said the automotive unit sales we believe or the reports we were getting were basically in the low single digits range. And the analog selling to that as a content was growing at a rate that was faster than that, perhaps twice that rate, which puts you in the high single digits range. And we said that we can see comfortably that we could grow at at-least twice that, because we've been growing at 3x that in the past. But we know those are all big numbers. I mean our automotive business is now large. It's 20% or over 20% of the Company revenues. And we did tell investors that we might get down in time to the higher double-digit range or high teens range. So, even if the auto sales numbers has a reduction, the semiconductor content in cars is still growing, and that's not going to change. So we expect that even if, and we are not saying that there will be car sale unit reductions because we don't have that insight, but even if that happens, the content still continues to grow in cars. And because of the decisions we made on where to invest, which is doing even better than the content, we can see us growing at twice the rate of analog semiconductor growth in cars. So that's why we feel good about the fact that we can see us growing in the high teens for the Company for multiple years. Now in that, there will be some modulation by number of cars sold, but we are still seeing growth that's kind of in addition to the unit car growth for the Company. Operator Our next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Your question please? William Stein Despite all the puts and takes by end market and the strength in automotive in March and I'd say the sub-seasonal expectation for June, overall revenue traction is still pretty good. Meanwhile, we've heard from some other semi companies and maybe some discussion in the channel of shortages of products and lead times extending. I'd love to hear your comments as to whether you're seeing that either in any of your business portfolio, any variations from normal expectations there, and whether you're seeing other complementary product shortages that are maybe causing a problem sort of through the supply chain affecting you? Tunc Doluca Let's just take cost first. If you look at our lead times that we are providing to our customers, we have not seen any change in our side. I think we are doing pretty well in terms of capacity and our ability to respond to our customers. So that's part one of the answer. From other suppliers, I think we are not seeing that as a general trend. I did read the Qualcomm report from yesterday and they did talk about some lead time extensions of one of their processors. So we are aware of that and I'm sure all of you are aware of that, because that came out publicly. But other than that, we are not hearing this as a general trend in the industry. And we certainly don't have it ourselves. So that's the extent of input I can give on that question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Cody Acree from Drexel Hamilton. Your question please? Cody Acree Tunc, maybe similar to the color you gave on the automotive segment longer-term, what are your thoughts on the long-term growth rates in the industrial segment and maybe any visibility you have to activity beyond the factory automation segment? Tunc Doluca So I think the best visibility we have got long term industrial is really in factory automation. We are seeing the results of investments that we have made in that starting back in 2012 in that range, and that really is giving us good growth. We also in addition had some initiatives last year and in the last few years about growing our other products in our core industrial segment that are going to our small and medium-sized businesses, and I think we are very encouraged by what Bruce quoted earlier that our distribution business had grown tremendously to get to a larger percentage of the Company revenues. So, there are in the core industrial segment I think the fact that we have invested in areas that help factory automation and that help build factories that are more productive, that involves distribution of decision-making so to speak to the factory floor, those are all great tailwinds for the Company. That's tailwinds for power management products, it's tailwinds for our interface for industrial grade communications products. So I think, long-term that will be a good growth vector for the Company. In addition, as you know, we also have some vertical industrial markets that we've invested in. Those are I'd say a bit more lumpy compared to what we see in core industrial in terms of growth. But in that space, we have also seen great strength more recently in like automated test equipment. We have done pretty well in that segment. We've got some good business there in security. We have got some good business there in medical. So, those investment areas that we chose, we chose very carefully and this was part of our more focused effort. So, the longer term, I think the industrial growth for us will be there. It won't be as large as automotive, when I said it's in the high teens for automotive, I don't think it's going to be that large, but it will still be a significant growth driver for the Company. Kathy Ta Jonathan, I think we have time just for one more question. Operator Certainly. Then our final question comes from, it's a follow-up from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your question please? Ambrish Srivastava Thanks for squeezing me in again. I just had a quick clarification. For the sell-in impact, Bruce, do you expect it to continue in the September quarter or it's a one-time impact? Bruce E. Kiddoo So for the $15 million to $20 million that we are talking about this quarter, it's a one-time effect. We do have one more distributor that we have to transition, John asked about that, and we expect that to happen in FY 2018. And if I had to, more likely than not, it will probably be in the first half of FY 2018. But again, that's more dependent on sort of kind of the accounting assessment. So there's one more, and it will be larger in that it is probably over 50% larger impact. Ambrish Srivastava Okay, I apologize if I missed that. Bruce E. Kiddoo The key thing is, for September, I mean at this point from a modelling point of view, I just assume that what we're seeing this quarter is a one-time and you got to kind of do whatever growth you're going to assume for the September quarter, do it off. Don't include this one-time impact. Ambrish Srivastava Got it. Thank you very much. Kathy Ta Okay, so I think that was our last question. So I would like to thank everyone for participating. That concludes today's conference call. We would like to thank you for your participation and your interest in Maxim.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan. Your question please? Harlan Sur Congratulations on the solid results and the outlook. On the better gross margins, 100 basis points better than guide for the March quarter, and another 100 basis points step-up here in June, question is, how much of that is due to the Dallas bump fab closure and how much of that is just due to kind of higher levels of revenues and/or other efficiencies? And is the June gross margin reflective of all the manufacturing cost initiatives that you've outlined or is there still more of that on the come? Thank you. Bruce E. Kiddoo Harlan, this is Bruce. I'll take that. So the Q3 gross margin of 65.2%, we hit our long-term goal there. That really had no benefit from Dallas, right. That kind of closed at the end of the quarter. So we didn't see any benefit from that. It was basically just continued blocking and tackling, right, the benefits of the transformation that we've done, the continued improved utilization at our remaining internal fab, and just kind of cost controls across the board. I will say, it came in a little better than we had originally anticipated. Part of that was just execution and part of that there is always a lot of factors that sort of flip both ways and sort of more than less kind of came up on the positive side this time. So we did have some benefits there. That said, we continue to forecast very strong gross margin for Q4, kind of the midpoint of 66% gross margin. Again, that continues just to sort of benefit from this ongoing transformation. I think once you change the culture and you get the momentum around kind of controlling costs, I think you continue to see that beyond what we initially expected. We will get a little benefit as well from the shift to sell-in. But it's clearly up even without that benefit. So your final question as far as, is there still more? I don't think we've seen the full benefit of Dallas. That said, in addition to that, we have some other long-term tailwinds that we have talked about in the past, the most significant of which is this kind of convergence of depreciation to CapEx. In Q3, kind of the normalized depreciation was $26 million in the quarter and CapEx was $8 million. That's a little low, right. If you think of kind of the midpoint of our range of 2%, say you're going to be at $12 million or $13 million a quarter. That's still a substantial gap to close. That's going to happen over multiple years, but that will be a nice tailwind for us. We're also going to have the benefit as we kind of work through the long-term supply agreement we have with TowerJazz for our ex San Antonio fab. That allows us to kind of the take or pay goes down and we can now move more so that we can get better loading at our internal fab and some of our other boundaries. And so that's a benefit. And then finally, industrial being our largest business now, distribution revenue at the highest it's ever been at 42% of revenue, and this is in March, this has no benefit of the shift in sell-in. So that's just kind of straight up benefit there. So, normally mix isn't a big part of what drives our gross margin, but I think long-term this shift where industrial and distribution are becoming large portions of our business will help from a tailwind as well. So, I mean I think we feel good on gross margin, I think we have worked very hard to execute and it's starting to flow through the P&L and driving EPS and cash flow. Harlan Sur Great execution. Thanks Bruce. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question please? Ross Seymore Just wanted to follow up on the sell-in change, Bruce, if you could just walk through conceptually what the implications are for the revenue side of the equation and for the gross margin side of the equation as we get into the September quarter, because is it one that the June quarter was elevated in a couple of areas and that's a one-time benefit or is there some additional sell-in revenue recognition that has to work its way through into September? Bruce E. Kiddoo Sure. So this is the start of the transition. Just to remind folks on the call and investors listening, the U.S. was generally on a sell-through basis, North America was on a sell-through basis and our international distributors wire on a sell-in basis. As we have gone through, this year we have focused a lot on our sales transformation and being able to sell to the broad market, and so we have put a lot of effort into kind of transforming our distribution business. And as part of that, we sort of looked at what are the terms that we offer, and in looking at our North America business, kind of from just applying GAAP and kind of the way we transformed our business, the shift to sell-in is more appropriate. And so, we had two main distributors in North America. One is shifting out because of kind of the way the terms fit and confidence in the reporting systems that we get from them, and so we are doing that one this quarter. We said that's the $15 million to $20 million of benefit this quarter. That will not repeat in Q1. So we need to make sure folks out there doing their models don't just start off that higher base. That said, to be very clear, this is revenue that we earned. It was on the balance sheet. We were going to recognize it eventually. So this is, it is real revenue, it should count against if you look at kind of annualized revenue and EPS, from that point of view. This is distribution business, so it's above the corporate average gross margin. And so, as I kind of indicated to Harlan's question, there is some benefit in the June quarter from that. That said, sort of kind of the ongoing benefits of our transformation in gross margin, we expect gross margin to continue to remain very strong. And so from that point of view, I mean there is always puts and takes, but I think there will be sort of, when we look at September, clearly the revenue will not benefit from that, but I think from a gross margin point of view, I think you will see less impact from that point of view. So does that answer your question, Ross? Ross Seymore Yes. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your question please? Ambrish Srivastava I wanted to focus on the auto business, and Tunc, as always you guys are very transparent. What was going to be my first question, the year-over-year growth, and you guys have done a fantastic job in growing the auto business, but the year-over-year growth is decelerating, and you talked about China as well as the U.S. slowdown. To my knowledge, first time at least I'm hearing a company talk about a slowdown which has been feared by investors and everybody for a while. Can you please talk about the visibility that you have, do you expect the year-over-year to decel as we go through the next couple of quarters or you think this is something that you don't have a lot of visibility in, or how should we think about it? Thank you. Tunc Doluca Thanks for that question. I think it is something that we did want to talk about in more detail, so you asking it is great. So essentially just to recap, automotive did have a very strong Q3. It was up 26% year-over-year. And if you really take a look at Q3 plus Q4, or half year, combined we are still up in the high teens year-over-year despite the fact that we guided flat for Q4. Now having said that, we obviously take a good close look at what happened here and we outlined some of the other reasons other than this great quarter we had in Q3, and we do see this weakness in BMS in China. This has been lumpy business in the past, but it has grown for us now. So it's got a bigger effect on the overall automotive revenue. And it really is determined in a large part by incentives that the government puts in place. So it is pretty hard for us to actually predict that frankly. The rest of our BMS business is a lot more stable, the ones coming from other regions, but this one really depends on how those incentives are put in place. Now long term, despite the lumpiness, we think there are some underlying reasons in China, mostly about pollution in the air, that will drive more electric vehicles and I think the government will continue to incentivize it. But I think the decisions come out in discrete form which affects demand. So that's one piece. The other piece is, I think as many of you following the auto business have followed, in the U.S. we did notice some softness in sales, and just looking at our product sales into that market, we are seeing that to be weaker than the other regions. So those are I think the two, other than the strength we had last quarter, are the two things we see fundamentally. However, the fundamentals continue to be strong for us. The design win pipeline forecast is very robust for infotainment and ADAS and electric vehicles as well. So we do expect this business to grow in the future in the double digits range for multiple years. But my experience in the past has always been that you never grow in a straight line, frankly, and I think we're just seeing a temporary effect in this quarter. But long-term, we like this business. I think most of our investors like it because it's sticky, it's stable, the sockets are there for multiple years, and no fundamentals have changed in the last quarter. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your question please? Tore Svanberg Congratulations on the results. Bruce, you talked about sell-through being a little bit weak earlier in the quarter and then it kind of strengthened, and then you're expecting I think you said pretty strong sell-through in the June quarter. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that please? Bruce E. Kiddoo So I think when we look at the third quarter, I thank we indicated resales were down sequentially, they were down 3%, which is basically in line with seasonality, maybe just one or two points weaker than seasonality. If you sort of look at that by geography, I think for us, and it's been a similar story the last couple of quarters, the Americas has been weak and it continues to be weak. And so that's just an issue that we are continuing to work on and to address. I would say, China and Japan were kind of in line with seasonality, and these are kind of normally some – resales are a little bit slower for both of those countries. EMEA was actually up strongly, which normally is again in line with seasonality. So I think the main weakness there in the third quarter was really the Americas, and I think everybody else was kind of as expected. When we do look forward to Q4, we are seeing very strong resale forecast. Again, when we look at the different countries, both probably led by Japan, as we have had good business there with some of our gaming opportunities, some of the automotive, so that's done well, and then we are also seeing sort of some expected strength in Europe and China as well. So, overall I think we are comfortable with kind of where we are at in the channel. We did see a slight uptick in the days, and so our target is at 55 to 60, we are at 62, and with the expectation for strong resales in the June quarter, I think we are comfortable with where we are sitting there. Basically the inventory is a couple of days above our target, but really in expectation of strong resales this quarter. Tore Svanberg Very helpful. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please? Vivek Arya Tunc, I'm wondering, in terms of use of cash, do you think either from a Maxim or if you could comment from an overall industry perspective, are we at a plateau in semis M&A or do you see additional consolidation potential in the industry beyond just small tuck-in deals? Because when I look at Maxim, your core business has stabilized, it's doing quite well. The consumer headwinds have sort of reversed and gross margins are definitely tracking better than expectations. So what will be the trigger for you to consider additional M&A and take advantage of your very strong balance sheet? Thank you. Tunc Doluca So, I mean we look at all possible ways to grow cash flows in the Company. Obviously the organic ones are ones that are completely in our control, and as you noted, we made a bunch of changes that made us stronger as a company. But one of the levers that we always have is to look at whether we can grow by acquiring other assets as well. But we also have some guidelines as to how we want to do that, and frankly, we wanted to be close to what we know how to run, which is businesses, analog and mixed-signal. We need any asset that we acquire, when we acquire it to be at least be able to get to the margin structure that we have as a company. And third is [indiscernible] our pick. So we look at what is the ROI in that investment. And we always have our eyes open. And that's one of the reasons why we do want a reasonable amount of capability or capacity to be able to do that. Having said all that, your other question is, will the M&A continue? I think that you opened up with that. And I think it will because the semiconductor industry is not growing as fast as it used to in the past. So I think everybody has criteria probably similar to what Maxim has, and that will probably in my view kind of slow things down a bit, but I think that in general, as long as debt is cheap, I think everybody is kind of looking at this as a growth opportunity. But we want to make sure that we are also very careful in our decisions in terms of growing with acquisition. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie Securities. Your question please? Srini Pajjuri Bruce, I just want to go back to the gross margin optimism that you commented about. Obviously you said the distribution is helping gross margins a bit. Just want to understand if you're seeing any better pricing trends given all the consolidation? I do look at the SA data and it doesn't seem like there is an evidence that pricing is getting any better, but I just want to hear your thoughts. Thank you. Bruce E. Kiddoo I think it kind of ties with the prior question around consolidation, and I think as our industry consolidates and there is just less semiconductor companies, I do think there are benefits across the board to margin, and whether that's in dealings with our suppliers or distributors or customers. And so, I think from that point of view, I think there is the opportunity to kind of fully capture value for the products that we sell. I think that's always been our goal and I think it's always a negotiation. And as far as how much of that value we keep versus our customers get to capture from us, and I think to the extent that consolidation is occurring, I think that that's helpful to us from a pricing point of view. It's not something that we look at as some short-term opportunity. We think this is something that we obviously kind of have strategic partnerships with our customers. But over a long term, we do think that's probably another tailwind to gross margin. I would say it's more subtle and it's not one we'll all be able to call out at some point in time and say, hey, we are up 50 bps because of pricing, I think it's more, I think it provides, in my sense the best way to characterize, as an underlying support for our gross margin. Whereas in the past I think chip companies were always having to sort of offset pricing reductions and I think that pressure probably abated a little bit. Tunc Doluca So just for me to add to that, I think most of the companies that are higher-quality companies have gotten a lot more disciplined on this, and I think that that helps. But as Bruce said, it's going to be difficult for us and for many other companies to say, we got this margin because we were able to get better control of prices. Very subtle and slow and distributed over many, many products. Operator Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question please? John Pitzer Bruce, I'm not sure if you mentioned when your second distributor in the U.S. is going to move to a sell-in. Could you help us understand when that might happen and would you expect sort of an equal amount? I guess just in general, as you think about sell-in versus sell-through, sell-in tends to create more volatility than sell-through in rev rec. And so, are you guys thinking about your own inventory levels differently as you try to manage a sell-in rev rec model versus a sell-through rev rec model or how should I think about that? Bruce E. Kiddoo So your first question, obviously we'll transition it when it's appropriate to transition, and this is more based on sort of kind of application of the accounting rules, from that point of view. My sense is, it's highly likely it will be in FY 2018, and if I had to do an over/under, it's probably more likely to be in the first half of FY 2018 than the second half. But that hasn't been determined yet, right, and that's something we continue to evaluate every quarter from that point of view as far as what is the proper accounting for that. As far as the transition to sell-in on a global basis, certainly it's something that as a CFO makes me a little bit nervous. We are very transparent on what our channel inventory is. We are very transparent on what our goals are and it's something we manage very closely internally to make sure that we stayed disciplined there and that we don't build up too much, or to be clear that we don't have too little out there as well, right. We believe, the ability of our distribution partners to have inventory to support small customers is important. So getting that, kind of from an asset management point of view, getting the right level and candidly the right products in distribution I think is important to it. And as far as your last question on our thoughts on our own inventory process, again I don't think that the difference between sell-in to sell-through changes that much from kind of any buffer inventories that we carry in our books. Obviously to the extent that we are selling into distribution, we expect them to carry the buffer. And so from that point of view, that's not a key area of our buffer plans for us. And then I guess finally, I think you also asked about the magnitude. Most likely it will be larger, maybe 50% or more larger than what we are currently looking at. John Pitzer That's helpful, Bruce. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of C. J. Muse from Evercore. Your question please? Christopher J. Muse I guess for my question I was hoping perhaps you could quantify expected growth in the consumer segment? If my math is right, it sounds like it's in high single digits. And then I guess, would love to hear your thoughts how you're thinking about seasonality into the second half of the year, particularly as it relates to your largest customer. Thanks. Tunc Doluca Okay, so I'll take that one. So in terms of seasonality or providing forecast for longer than a quarter, we haven't been doing that for a while and we really don't want to do it. The visibility is really not that clear, especially in consumer into that space. And your question was about consumer growth, and I do want to answer that. I mean in the short term, our goal is really to simply stabilize our consumer revenue. And the mechanism we are using for that is to get diversification, as Bruce and I mentioned, by winning in end equipment other than smartphones and winning in wearables and some hearables, tablets, gaming, all kinds of other things, and also wining at other customers, even in the smartphone space, to be able to diversify that. So, I think the way to think about it in the short term is to see if we can really make it not go down, like it used to in the past. We have made great progress in that space last year. And I think that our ability to diversify the business is going to help us also in terms of stabilizing it. But I think we won't be able to give any guidance for next quarter or next year. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your question please? Craig Hettenbach Tunc, appreciate all the color on the automotive market. Just maybe taking that a step further when you think about some of the very near term headwinds, anything from a change of customers in terms of build plans or how are they kind of reacting to if you call it kind of a mild slowdown for parts of the automotive business? Tunc Doluca Frankly, when we are looking into our guidance numbers and if we are trying to make some sense out of it, what we found is really nothing that was really very obvious frankly. I mean it took us a while to dig in and figure out the answers. So we are not really seeing some big signal from any sector that says there is a big slowdown going on, other than China. I think in China the incentive thing was pretty obvious and it was one of the important things that we saw right away. So, I'm afraid we are not going to be able to give a lot more insight into what's going on overall in the automotive market, and I think our information is kind of it is filtered through too many layers before it gets to us, because most of our sales are into Tier 1s and they sell into multiple regions. So it's not very easy to get the information you are asking for. Bruce E. Kiddoo Yes, I guess the good news about our automotive business has been it's broadly diversified and we sell across, as Tunc said, multiple Tier 1s and some OEMs across multiple regions with multiple products. That's what makes it a very nice business. It's like the old industrial business that was always a great business and is still a great business, but very difficult to articulate exactly what's causing that business to go up or down in the short term. But of course that's why, A, it's a great long-term business for us, and B, while we have the confidence that while there is always going to be some kind of quarterly variations, as Tunc said, long-term we are still highly confident that this will be a very strong growth business for us for many years to come. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danley from Citigroup. Your question please? Christopher Danley Just a little more clarification on the auto slowdown, so when did the slowdown start, was it push-out to cancellations, do you think it can get worse, and then do you think things will be back to normal by next quarter? Tunc Doluca So I mean we didn't really see any signs that were like a big push-out or a cancellation or anything like that. It's just from the information that we were getting in giving or looking at what the revenue is going to look like for the current quarter, it looked like there is – we had such good growth in the previous quarter, I think that's really the biggest effect here compared to all the other ones we talked about. And if you kind of do a moving average, we are still on a really nice growth curve and we have no reason to believe that that moving average has suddenly had a big change in slope. So, no – I understand what you are asking, you're saying, was it some big events that occurred, and that is not the case. Bruce E. Kiddoo If anything, we had a tremendous quarter. Christopher Danley Okay. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question please? Toshiya Hari I wanted to follow up on gross margins. Bruce, when you think about your business over the next couple of years in terms of manufacturing footprint, business mix, customer concentration or diversification, is the mid 60s to high 60% range kind of the new steady-state or do you think you can aim for 70% or higher on a multi-year basis? Thank you. Bruce E. Kiddoo So, we are doing really well on gross margins, and we set a goal to go from kind of 60%-61% to 65%. I think the Company executed phenomenally and I think we got to our 65% and we got there earlier than we thought. We clearly are now guiding to something above that and we believe there's tailwinds that will help us and support our gross margin going forward. That said, I don't think we're prepared to update the model from a commitment point of view. I think we'll continue to evaluate this. We are kind of going through our planting season right now. Our fiscal year ends in June. And so we'll get a good sense of what that gross margin looks like out for the next three years. I mean right now, we're just focused on execution and delivering kind of the best gross margin we can, and I think when it's appropriate, we'll look to update the model. But for now, I think we're just going to continue to execute and I think we'll continue to be able to deliver gross margins in the range we're at now. Toshiya Hari Got it. Thanks so much. Operator Our next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo. Your question please? David Wong Bruce, you ran through roughly how the extra revenue from the change to sell-in recognition was divided amongst your various end market segments. Can you give us some idea of what the year-over-year growth numbers look like by segment, if we back out this transition? Bruce E. Kiddoo I have about 20 pieces of paper in front of me and I don't have that piece of paper in front of me. So we'll get back to you. I don't have that. David Wong Okay, fine, thanks. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chin from UBS. Your question please? Steven Chin I had one on the comm and data center business, if I could, just given some of the benefits from the distributor sell-in revenue recognition for that division, could you possibly provide a little more color on how that segment might be performing for this June quarter if you were to back out that sell-in benefit? And also, specific to the comm infrastructure portion, how is I guess the overall demand or inventory levels for that part of your business, because I know that can be lumpy, and given some of the I guess downward bias in telco CapEx I think in China and even here in Verizon recently, if you're seeing any effects of that? Thank you. Bruce E. Kiddoo I'll answer the numbers and I'll let Tunc give the color on the business. As far as I mean we are guiding our kind of comm and data center business up in Q4, the change to sell-in doesn't have changed that. If we hadn't had that, it would be up as well. So from that point of view, there is no qualitative change in our guidance. As far as your other questions, Tunc? Tunc Doluca So in the near term, we did project comms and data center to be up quarter over quarter and we do see growth both in the optical data center side and the infrastructure side, both of them. Your question about lumpiness certainly is true for the comms infrastructure side of the business and we don't really have enough of an exposure to be able to tell what the inventory levels are at our customers. Obviously we know what it is at our distributors. And we are not aware of issues there. But we don't know what it is at the customers. Over the long term, the biggest growth driver for us is going to be on the cloud data center side of this business. I think we have talked about in the past about our investments, especially on the optical data communications within a data center application, and that business is doing really well. This is the 100G gigabit per second connectivity business we've had. It's been a great business for us because we've made the right decisions on architecture and how to help our customers design the modules for this, especially on the laser driver side, and we are confident that we're going to see a transition to 100G because it's faster speed and better, lower power consumption for these systems. And we are really at the early innings in that growth. I mean we began to see demand starting back in the December quarter and now we are seeing continued growth and we continue to see year-over-year growth in optical. So I think that that one is really a transition from lower frequency to higher frequency in a market that's already growing. So that's all helping us and giving us a lot of tailwind in this data center and comms business. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Your question please? Christopher Rolland Just to follow up on auto again, and once again congrats on another great quarter there and what's been a really terrific year, in your last Analyst Day you said that that segment will grow 2x the overall auto market, but there is some belief that SAR could be flat or even modestly down this year, so that rule of thumb kind of breaks down. So I guess my first question is, on a flat SAR, what do you think we could do for auto? Is the double-digit scenario that you alluded to still achievable there? And then secondly, if the SAR does decline, it's probably because of the lack of subsidies in China. Do you guys happen to know your NGO exposure? I know it can be tough, but do you know China versus EU versus North America for example? Tunc Doluca Okay, so that's a lot of questions in there, but let me just tell you what we said and then we can get back into the question you were asking. So basically, at our Investor Day, which was a little bit over a year ago, and at investor meetings that we've had, at various conferences, we've said the automotive unit sales we believe or the reports we were getting were basically in the low single digits range. And the analog selling to that as a content was growing at a rate that was faster than that, perhaps twice that rate, which puts you in the high single digits range. And we said that we can see comfortably that we could grow at at-least twice that, because we've been growing at 3x that in the past. But we know those are all big numbers. I mean our automotive business is now large. It's 20% or over 20% of the Company revenues. And we did tell investors that we might get down in time to the higher double-digit range or high teens range. So, even if the auto sales numbers has a reduction, the semiconductor content in cars is still growing, and that's not going to change. So we expect that even if, and we are not saying that there will be car sale unit reductions because we don't have that insight, but even if that happens, the content still continues to grow in cars. And because of the decisions we made on where to invest, which is doing even better than the content, we can see us growing at twice the rate of analog semiconductor growth in cars. So that's why we feel good about the fact that we can see us growing in the high teens for the Company for multiple years. Now in that, there will be some modulation by number of cars sold, but we are still seeing growth that's kind of in addition to the unit car growth for the Company. Operator Our next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Your question please? William Stein Despite all the puts and takes by end market and the strength in automotive in March and I'd say the sub-seasonal expectation for June, overall revenue traction is still pretty good. Meanwhile, we've heard from some other semi companies and maybe some discussion in the channel of shortages of products and lead times extending. I'd love to hear your comments as to whether you're seeing that either in any of your business portfolio, any variations from normal expectations there, and whether you're seeing other complementary product shortages that are maybe causing a problem sort of through the supply chain affecting you? Tunc Doluca Let's just take cost first. If you look at our lead times that we are providing to our customers, we have not seen any change in our side. I think we are doing pretty well in terms of capacity and our ability to respond to our customers. So that's part one of the answer. From other suppliers, I think we are not seeing that as a general trend. I did read the Qualcomm report from yesterday and they did talk about some lead time extensions of one of their processors. So we are aware of that and I'm sure all of you are aware of that, because that came out publicly. But other than that, we are not hearing this as a general trend in the industry. And we certainly don't have it ourselves. So that's the extent of input I can give on that question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Cody Acree from Drexel Hamilton. Your question please? Cody Acree Tunc, maybe similar to the color you gave on the automotive segment longer-term, what are your thoughts on the long-term growth rates in the industrial segment and maybe any visibility you have to activity beyond the factory automation segment? Tunc Doluca So I think the best visibility we have got long term industrial is really in factory automation. We are seeing the results of investments that we have made in that starting back in 2012 in that range, and that really is giving us good growth. We also in addition had some initiatives last year and in the last few years about growing our other products in our core industrial segment that are going to our small and medium-sized businesses, and I think we are very encouraged by what Bruce quoted earlier that our distribution business had grown tremendously to get to a larger percentage of the Company revenues. So, there are in the core industrial segment I think the fact that we have invested in areas that help factory automation and that help build factories that are more productive, that involves distribution of decision-making so to speak to the factory floor, those are all great tailwinds for the Company. That's tailwinds for power management products, it's tailwinds for our interface for industrial grade communications products. So I think, long-term that will be a good growth vector for the Company. In addition, as you know, we also have some vertical industrial markets that we've invested in. Those are I'd say a bit more lumpy compared to what we see in core industrial in terms of growth. But in that space, we have also seen great strength more recently in like automated test equipment. We have done pretty well in that segment. We've got some good business there in security. We have got some good business there in medical. So, those investment areas that we chose, we chose very carefully and this was part of our more focused effort. So, the longer term, I think the industrial growth for us will be there. It won't be as large as automotive, when I said it's in the high teens for automotive, I don't think it's going to be that large, but it will still be a significant growth driver for the Company. Kathy Ta Jonathan, I think we have time just for one more question. Operator Certainly. Then our final question comes from, it's a follow-up from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your question please? Ambrish Srivastava Thanks for squeezing me in again. I just had a quick clarification. For the sell-in impact, Bruce, do you expect it to continue in the September quarter or it's a one-time impact? Bruce E. Kiddoo So for the $15 million to $20 million that we are talking about this quarter, it's a one-time effect. We do have one more distributor that we have to transition, John asked about that, and we expect that to happen in FY 2018. And if I had to, more likely than not, it will probably be in the first half of FY 2018. But again, that's more dependent on sort of kind of the accounting assessment. So there's one more, and it will be larger in that it is probably over 50% larger impact. Ambrish Srivastava Okay, I apologize if I missed that. Bruce E. Kiddoo The key thing is, for September, I mean at this point from a modelling point of view, I just assume that what we're seeing this quarter is a one-time and you got to kind of do whatever growth you're going to assume for the September quarter, do it off. Don't include this one-time impact. Ambrish Srivastava Got it. Thank you very much. Kathy Ta Okay, so I think that was our last question. So I would like to thank everyone for participating. That concludes today's conference call. We would like to thank you for your participation and your interest in Maxim.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Melissa, Head of Global Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Melissa Trombetta - Mylan NV Thank you, Terence. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's first quarter 2017 earnings conference earnings. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Commercial Officer, Tony Mauro; and Chief Financial Officer, Ken Parks. During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial outlook and 2017 guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections. Please refer to the earnings release we submitted to the SEC on Form 8-K earlier this morning, which is also posted on our website for a fuller explanation of those risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements. In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of financial performance. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures, are available in our first quarter earnings release, which I just mentioned and which can be found on our website at newsroom.mylan.com.

Bresch - Mylan NV Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Mylan's first quarter results marked the start of what we believe will be another great year of performance for our company. On the top line, we generated total revenues of more than $2.7 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24%; and on the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $500 million, or $0.93 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 22%. Not only is this a strong performance as the quarter goes, it also once again demonstrates the resiliency of the global platform we've built and our ability to absorb both our industry's natural volatility as well as additional headwinds, related to particular product and/or markets. Over the past few years, our strategic acquisitions and ability to truly integrate Mylan had allowed us to transform ourselves into a highly differentiated and diversified organization, as evidenced by our geographical reach, our broad portfolio, our extensive pipeline, and our ability to expand the world's access to high quality products. This organization enables our unique go-to-market approach in-country, optimizing our brand, branded generic, generic and OTC products. In fact, it's precisely this unique profile and approach of how, to how we now run and drive our businesses that led us to change our reporting from product-focused segments to geography-focused segments. For these reasons, we remain confident in our ability to meet our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55, which is not dependent on any one product. Our strong first quarter results are set against a backdrop of the global debate regarding healthcare and, to a degree, unprecedented here in the U.S. The current debate continues to focus both on how healthcare has delivered as well as its price, and we are encouraged by the recent multiple actions of players across multiple industries that help reduce the burden to patients. As a leading generics company, Mylan has a 55-year history of providing access and serving as part of the backbone of healthcare systems around the world that help supply affordable medicine, and we fully intend to keep doing our part to deliver better health for a better world. I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team to thank all of our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution during the quarter and for their continued commitment to serving all of our stakeholders around the world. In addition, we continue to build our bench strength and I'd like to welcome Dan Gallagher, who joined Mylan last month as our Chief Legal Officer. His extensive experience in regulatory matters, financial markets and corporate legal affairs and governance makes him an excellent addition to our senior leadership team and further depth to our already strong legal organization. He will prove invaluable as we maximize our many opportunities. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I too would like to thank our employees around the world for their continued dedication and hard work as well as their unwavering focus on our mission and business objectives. It is this focus from each and every one of them that allowed us to again deliver strong performance around the world. Let's turn to the first quarter results where we have reported according to our new regional segments. I'll provide an overview of our top line performance and Ken will get into segment profitability. Overall, our total business delivered revenue of approximately $2.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of 24% compared to the prior year. This performance is once again driven by the strength, diversity and the resilience of the assets we have assembled and successfully integrated. The global pricing environment was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance. Tony will provide an update on this topic shortly. In North America, our business grew approximately 5% to more than $1.2 billion. This increase was primarily due to net sales from the acquisitions of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business. These increases were partially offset by the net impact of lower net sales from new products and existing products. As anticipated, sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector declined in the current quarter as a result of increased competition and the impact of lower priced authorized generic. Excluding the impact of EpiPen, our North American business would have been up approximately 20%. This year, EpiPen will represent less than 5% of global revenues and less than 10% of sales in North America. In Europe, sales totaled about $900 million, a year-over-year increase of 53%. The increase was primarily the result of net sales from acquisition of Meda. We continue to grow our leadership position in key European markets, such as Italy, where we recently became the generics market leader, and France. We also continued to experience sustained growth in our key products across the region. In Rest of the World, sales totaled about $580 million, a year-over-year increase of 34%. This increase was primarily driven by acquisition of Meda. In addition, net sales from existing products increased, as high volumes offset lower pricing throughout the segment. We were especially pleased to see a return to strong growth in our ARV franchise, with double digits year-over-year growth. We look forward to continued opportunities for growth in ARV with the launch of our TLE400 product in the developing world. We continue to make good progress in the integration of Mylan and are on track to realizing our synergy targets, as evidenced by the decrease in our SG&A spend on a percentage basis year over year. We also continue to leverage revenue synergy opportunities by operating as One Mylan. With now three quarters under our belt, these acquisitions are exceeding our expectations, and we are well-positioned to leverage these assets and see continued benefits from these assets. With regards to our operating platform, Mylan has always had a deep and unwavering commitment to quality everywhere we operate. FDA standards for our industry continue to evolve, and this continues to raise the bar for every player in our industry, which is something we very much welcome. For Mylan's part, we are dedicated to continually enhancing our systems and processes with a deliberate and thorough approach to ensure sustainable quality across our entire network of facilities, working closely with FDA to resolve any issues that come our way. As you are aware, we recently received a warning letter at our Nashik site in India. We are working closely with the FDA to respond to and address the issues raised in the letter as comprehensively and expeditiously as possible. Production from Nashik site continues uninterrupted, and we anticipate no material impact to Mylan's overall business as a result of this warning letter. At the same time, we have successfully completed remediation efforts at the three sites acquired from Agila that were under FDA warning letters. The warning letters have been lifted at both SFF [Specialty Formulation Facility] and SPD [Sterile Product Division] sites and we are pleased with our progress at OTL [Onco Therapies Limited] site, which also was very recently inspected by FDA. I note that during the quarter, we had 15 inspections by various global regulators across our 50 facilities. In fact, the Nashik site is in good standing with other global regulatory entities, including WHO and MHRA, which inspected the site following FDA and issued a GMP compliance certificate. Turning now to some of our key pipeline programs, with regards to our biosimilar portfolio, we continue to make good progress on our applications and are working closely with the various health authorities on the reviews and with regard to the GCP and GMP inspection of our facilities. We remain on track with all key programs, including insulin glargine. As a reminder, during the quarter we announced that we agreed to the terms of a global settlement with Genentech and Roche in relation to patents from Herceptin, which provides Mylan with global licenses for our trastuzumab product, excluding Brazil, Japan, and Mexico. This global license will provide a clear pathway for Mylan to commercialize its product in various markets around the world commencing on the license effective dates. As of this quarter, we now have approval for our trastuzumab biosimilar in 15 developing markets. On the respiratory front, we received a Complete Response Letter from FDA regarding our ANDA for generic Advair Diskus. We have carefully assessed the CRL, which represents a full review of the ANDA from all FDA disciplines. Although it's designated as a major CRL, we have a difference of opinion with the agency on certain items raised in the CRL. We believe that the resolution of some of these points, based on our previously agreed-upon protocols with FDA, can potentially change this major designation of the CRL. In any event, the agency has again explicitly confirmed that they consider this application a high priority. For these reasons, it's important for us to have this interaction with the FDA before we can comment further upon the potential impact of the CRL. Regardless of the timing, we remain confident that there will be a significant market opportunity for a substitutable generic to Advair and that demand for this product will be strong. I would also like to note that we are ready from both a manufacturing and commercial perspective to launch upon approval. It's important to note that our Dublin manufacturing facility was inspected by FDA in June of 2016, and we have been informed that this facility is in good standing. Turning to Copaxone, we have a target action date for both the 20-milligram and 40-milligram for next month. We see no reason that these dates cannot be met. We believe that all scientific questions have been resolved to FDA satisfaction and we also believe that there are no facility GMP issues that should be a barrier to approval of this ANDA. Generally speaking, we believe that the process for approving complex generics continues to be an area that requires greater focus and clarity. And we believe that FDA is committed to enhancing its capabilities and approach in this area. We are encouraged by the comments by the new FDA Commissioner that this process will be a priority for him, as he assumed his new office. We remain very committed to investing in complex products through our robust R&D efforts. Mylan is distinguished from many of our competitors as a result of our willingness to make the substantial investments required over the long term to continue to bring these needed products to the patients. Although you will continue to see some variability in our quarterly R&D spending due to the timing of program spend, there is no change to our overall commitment to investment in R&D. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on commercial landscape. Thank you. Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. As Rajiv noted, we have continued to see growth across all of our regions, with very strong double-digit growth in Europe and Rest of World and solid performance in North America. We also continue to see growth from our global key brands around the world. As in previous recent quarters, the pricing environment remains a topic of much discussion throughout our industry. We are pleased that as a result of our diversity from a product, channel and geographic perspective, our expectations for the global pricing environment are unchanged, and we are still predicting mid-single-digit price erosion globally for the year. This quarter, we actually saw price erosion in the low single digits on a global basis. While price erosion in our U.S. generics business was in the mid-single digits. Looking ahead in the U.S., we have several meaningful first-to-market products that launched in 2016 that have come off their exclusivity periods, which will cause fluctuations and skew year-over-year comparisons in the coming quarters. This being said, excluding these products from our future outlook, we expect that our U.S. base business will continue to maintain annualized erosion in the mid single-digits. Let me reiterate again that we continue to believe we will see mid single-digit price erosion for our global business for the remainder of the year, including all products. With respect to EpiPen, the authorized generic continues to gain traction and now represents almost 40% of the epinephrine auto-injector market. Additionally, we have seen market growth pick up to more than 10% year over year for the category. The AG also continues to have the lowest wholesale acquisition cost of any Epinephrine Auto-Injector on the market. That said, competitive activity in the space continues to be robust and our overall shares declined from last year. You are aware of the worldwide recall of 20-plus lots of EpiPen by the manufacturer Pfizer's Meridian Medical Technologies. We quickly implemented a voucher program for patients to replace any impacted products and have successfully been executing on this program. We in partnership with our customers continue to communicate to impacted patients and replace their product as efficiently as possible while ensuring these patients have no additional out-of-pocket costs. We also note that Meridian Medical Technologies is contractually responsible for the recall costs. We continue to be very pleased with the contribution from the assets we have acquired, which have even further strengthened our broad portfolio offering for our customers. For example, during the first quarter, we completed our acquisition of Cold-EEZE, as we continue to expand our OTC business. Cold-EEZE is now Mylan's largest U.S. consumer healthcare brand and we look forward to serving this loyal customer base and supporting this well-known brand. With that, I will turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Let me add a little more detail on our financial results. First quarter revenues grew to $2.7 billion, and that's an increase of 24% over the first quarter of last year. This increase included growth in third-party net sales of 5% in our North America segment, 53% in our Europe segment, and 34% in our Rest of World segment. The key drivers to these increases were net sales from the acquisitions of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business, which totaled approximately $607 million in the quarter. These increases were partially offset by an $86 million net decrease in the combination of sales driven by the impact of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products. For the quarter, we continued to experience global generic price deflation in the low single-digits. As Rajiv mentioned, net sales from our North America segment reached $1.2 billion and grew by 5%, up approximately 20% excluding EpiPen Auto-Injector. Net sales from acquisitions contributed approximately $182 million of the sales growth, and partially offsetting this increase was a net decrease in sales from the combination of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products. In addition, segment profitability increased 3%. Net sales in our Europe segment increased by approximately $308 million or 53%. The acquisition of Meda contributed approximately $338 million of the sales growth and this increase was partially offset by a net decrease in sales from the combination of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 4%. Segment profitability in Europe increased approximately 88% year over year. Net sales from our Rest of World segment increased by approximately $146 million or 34%. This increase was driven largely by the acquisition of Meda, which totaled approximately $87 million. In addition, higher volumes from existing products, primarily in our antiretroviral franchise, plus an increase in new products more than offset ongoing pricing headwinds. Net sales in this segment were favorably impacted by approximately 3% due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Segment profitability in Rest of World increased approximately 159% in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 were 53%. That's down less than 60 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to the impact from the launch of the EpiPen Auto-Injector authorized generic, as well as additional competition and partially offset by the contributions from prior-year acquisitions. Moving on to our operating expenses, on an adjusted basis, R&D declined to $151 million, equating to approximately 6% of revenues, which was in line with our expectations. SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, increased to $592 million, primarily as a result of selling and marketing costs from the acquired businesses. However, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues declined by 1.3 percentage points to approximately 22% of sales, as increased revenues from the acquired businesses and benefits to Mylan integration were realized in the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate was 17.5% for the first quarter of 2017, which was also in line with our expectations. Adjusted net earnings increased by $114 million to $500 million in the quarter and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.93 compared to $0.76 in the prior-year quarter. Turning to cash flow and liquidity, adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong at $536 million for the first three months of the year compared to $202 million for the prior year. The increase in the current quarter was mostly driven by favorable timing of working capital, including receivables, due to the December launch of EpiPen authorized generic. We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivable securitization or revolving credit facility. At the end of Q1 2017, our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA leverage ratio declined to approximately 3.7 times as compared to 3.8 times at the end of 2016. On a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA basis, we were at 3.5 times at the end of the first quarter. We are fully committed to our investment-grade rating and to reducing our debt, as evidenced by our voluntary prepayment of $550 million on our 2016 term loans during the first quarter. We have no significant near-term debt maturities and we remain committed to moving towards our long-term average target leverage ratio of approximately 3 times EBITDA. We have the financial flexibility to achieve this goal while still deploying capital for strategic acquisitions. As you can see, we started off the year strong and we're very pleased with our operational and financial results for the first three months of the year. We remain committed to our previously communicated full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55, which keeps us on track to realizing our $6 adjusted EPS goal in 2018. In terms of phasing, we continue to see the relative percentage contribution from the first half of 2017 to be consistent with the percentage contribution of the first half of 2016. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. And our first question comes from Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James. Your line is open. Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks, good morning. First question for Heather, Rajiv, Tony. I guess specifically with respect to the evolving consortium dynamics and particularly the McKesson-Walmart collaboration, a lot of small to mid-sized manufacturers have pointed to this dynamic as having a significant negative impact on their business or at least creating a potential to having a significant negative impact on their business. I'm just wondering what Mylan's position is on the evolution of that particular consortium, whether or not you're actually seeing a current impact or this is something that you think is going to play out over the next couple of quarters, and then just maybe conceptually how much risk that creates around your mid-single-digit pricing erosion assumption. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV Okay, Elliot. Thanks. I'll start off and then Rajiv or Tony can chime in. Elliot, I think this is no different than the consolidation we've seen over the last several years. When you look at our customer base, the consolidation, especially from a global perspective, what we've said then and remains true today is that consolidation is really a benefit to a company like ours at Mylan, given our portfolio, our breadth. and our geographical reach, our ability to not only supply the level of demand that is needed but to be able to do so on a global basis. And I think what we've seen as a continued strength as these customers have consolidated our ability to really leverage our entire portfolio as well as our pipeline. We've got some important products coming. And what I would say is I can appreciate some of the players that are in one country or geographically landlocked or from a product perspective not being able to meet some of the supply and demand needed on a global basis. So I think this further underscores Mylan's differentiated and diversified platform and is allowing us to meet and exceed quite honestly what we have done in the past with some of these players as they're looking at a different business model. Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV Thanks, Heather. And, Elliot, yes, historically we've seen consolidation and the consolidation of businesses and aggregating these models together have some effect on erosion. What we continue to see, though, is that we have this differentiated platform with a diverse portfolio of products, best-in-class service levels, and the inclusion of new products into this mix in terms of always adding to what we've had. So we're excited to service McKesson, Walmart, and all our customers, and we want to mean more to them in the future. So I think that scale along with our geographic overlap plays a very important role into our success in that business. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV And I would just add that we have taken into consideration this alliance into our projections. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV And that reminded me and, Elliot, I don't think we can underscore this enough, we mentioned this at Investor Day, but the continuity of our management team. We've been together over a decade working with these customers and bringing that leadership. And I think as we look at all that's happening externally and the environment around us, that's continued to play a critical role in our ability to leverage our business. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Gary Nachman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gary Nachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi, good morning. On generic Advair, can you give some more color at a high level on what the key differences are between you and FDA? What areas are they focused on? And then it sounds like timing is a bit up in the air. When do you think you will be able to meet with them? And on Copaxone, just describe your readiness to launch that product, both the 20-milligram and the 40-milligram, if you actually get the approval at the action date next month. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV So let me take the easy one first, which is Copaxone, and just talk about our readiness. Yes, you will expect us to be in a state of readiness from the manufacturing point of view – from commercial manufacturing point of view in anticipation of the target action dates. Regarding generic Advair, so let me reiterate that this submission was done in complete accordance to the product-specific guidance and pre-agreed protocols. And we have not been asked to do any additional clinical endpoints or device-related studies at this juncture. What we have been asked is now that some of the studies, especially the device-related studies, we have now been asked to analyze and report our findings of our study against the newly issued industry draft guidance for conduct of human practice studies – draft guidance. So that's what we want to go back and discuss with FDA, and we can get this meeting any day. We have been waiting for this meeting and it can happen any moment or any day. And we can only comment upon the potential impact of the CRL once we have these discussions behind us. So that's what we are waiting for before we comment upon any impact on timing. Operator And our next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Ken, maybe for you, and I just want to say I do appreciate the increased transparency. We always want more, though. And based on our math, it seems that most of the miss in North America was EpiPen. And if you could, just confirm that that was the case. Based on triangulating your numbers, it seems that EpiPen came in at around $123 million, which was well below what we were thinking. And I'm just wondering if that's related to the recall. Is that the new level of sales that we should expect? Will that continue to erode? Help us to think about that. And secondly in terms of your revenue guide, which I don't know that I heard you reiterate – if you do want to, this is a good opportunity. If not, that says something too. But to hit the low end of your revenue guide would seem to require about $350 million in the new product sales. I think you had talked about $850 million in new product sales at your Analyst Day. So obviously, some things work; some things don't work. But if you could comment on that math, I would appreciate it. Thanks. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV All right. Jami, I first have to jump in and just say thank you for the acknowledgment on transparency. As we said, many of us have had many discussions. And we told you, I personally said that, look, I want to continue to try to give the right visibility into this business. That's what we're here to do. We've got a lot of moving pieces and parts. We're trying to be reflective of how we're running and driving this business, which is completely leveraging all of these channels from generic brands and branded generics and OTCs and how we're leveraging those in country. So I really appreciate your recognition of that, and we're going to continue to do so. And the one thing I'll just say on EpiPen and then I'll let Ken get into some of the financials is that, as we said on Investor Day, Jami, we anticipated a big change in EpiPen, and we knew that it would continue to be a mix between the AG and the brand and we continue to see that conversion. But the reality is people had a very strong loyalty to the brand EpiPen and it's continued to be an education to let them know that it's the same product. But what I will say about EpiPen, it's what we expected, and obviously that continues to be into the guidance that we reiterated this morning. Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV I'll also say thank you for the comment because we are truly the way we put the release together and including providing you a number for North America excluding EpiPen, we'll still allow you to have that visibility into what's going on with the EpiPen product. With that number, you've done the math, you can model it, you're right in the ballpark. As far as projecting out the year, we don't give any quarterly kind of run rate on EpiPen. But as Heather said, what happened in the quarter was very consistent with what we expected. The recall did occur. We've disclosed both in the Q and in our commentary that the costs of the recall are recoverable. That has driven a little bit of change in trend and some of the sales number, but nothing of significance. But to reiterate, we said at Investor Day that year-over-year EpiPen profitability at the operating profit level will be down $400 million year over year, a huge number. $500 million at the gross profit level, offset by some reduction in spending in sales and marketing. And that's exactly where we're moving through right now. So, you've done the math, you're right in the right ballpark, and everything is exactly how we expected it. As far as new products, we said we'd have $850 million of contribution this year year-over-year for new products. And at this point in time, we're working towards that roadmap. It's a long list of products. And whether it would be at the low end, the mid, we're generating those new product launches in order to drive to $850 million. Operator And our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thanks, team. In the interest of transparency, have you thought about giving an EPS target for next year that does not include the help of capital deployments? And then for Rajiv, two quick ones, one on Advair. Your comments seem to suggest you're not confident that your data would fit with the draft guidance. Maybe I misread that. But could you state how you feel about the draft guidance as a potential stumbling block? And on biosimilar Lantus or glargine, can you talk about the legal and regulatory steps between now and launch? I believe there's a stay at a minimum. Thanks. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV All right, Gregg. Thanks. I'll start and then I'll let Rajiv take on the products. I guess Gregg, what I would say, I am not sure how somebody gives guidance without talking about capital deployment, whether that's in business development opportunities. I think we were very clear and transparent on Investor Day of what we said of our assumptions leading to that $6 target that we continue to walk through over the last five years. And that deployment of cash while maintaining our balance sheet being able to bolt-on important product acquisitions, as we've done already this year and we'll continue to do so. So, look, we continue to be executing towards the roadmap that we laid out in March and we'll continue to update as appropriately. But what we laid out on Investor Day is what we're executing against. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV Yeah, Gregg, on Advair, I mean, there is nothing in my voice you should hear that we don't feel comfortable about interpreting our data to the new guidance, but we have a difference of opinion at a policy level that agency is applying a draft guidance as against a pre-approved or pre-agreed protocol. So that's what we're trying to discuss and negotiate with them because it all adds to the timing and the classification of the CRL. Second, on Lantus, we are very much on track and you should expect to hear from us anytime now about our regulatory filing in USA. Operator And our next question comes from Douglas Tsao from Barclays. Your line is open. Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So just, Rajiv, not to sort of beat a dead horse, but just following up on Advair again. Maybe if you could just walk through what the sort of the next steps are for you providing some – or providing the Street some clarity in terms of the roadmap forward and resolving the sort of difference of opinion? And would you pursue or think about pursuing sort of like dispute resolution within the agency? Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV It's too early for us. We have sought a meeting and we have been told that FDA is working on to grant us a meeting, or very soon we'll hear from them. And I don't want to comment anything beyond that. We should be able to be in a good position to talk about it once we have this meeting behind us. Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. And then just in terms of the warning letter at the Nashik plant, I believe that was primarily antiretrovirals. Just curious if it was limited to that. And has the warning letter had any impact on potential approvals converting to final that you might have had tentatives on? Thank you. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV Nashik is not limited to antiretrovirals. Nashik is a global site and does produce some U.S. products and some of the U.S. launches will be potentially impacted by that. But as I confirmed, they are not material to our overall Mylan's business. Operator And our next question comes from Tim Chiang from BTIG. Your line is open. Tim Chiang - BTIG LLC Hi, Rajiv. Just one last follow-up question on Advair. In assuming that you go down the pathway with the FDA and you still have this disagreement on the draft guidance, would you guys consider still trying to launch your product, but launch it without an AB rating, just go as a 505(b)(2) or launch it as a branded generic? Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV No. There's no discussion in this complete response letter or a point being made about this being not 505(j) or being about 505(b)(2). And we don't see because it is exactly – the product is exactly as per the guidance issue by the FDA. It has been accepted as 505(j). So I don't want to even think and comment about that because it's not real. So I don't want to speculate on that. Operator And our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Heather, I have a few, if I may. Heather, you mentioned acquisitions are exceeding expectations and I wanted to clarify, was that a comment directed at Meda, Renaissance or also at the Abbott EPD. Ken, perhaps, a quick clarification on your end. I know you're reiterating EPS guidance. Are you also reiterating revenue guidance? Just wanted to confirm that. And then, Rajiv, we noticed Vytorin and Seroquel XR approvals for some of your competitors, but haven't seen that press release from you guys yet. So I just wanted to understand what the cause for the delay was or is there anything at any specific facility we should be aware of? And I just wanted to stop there. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV Okay, all right. Hi, Umer. I would say we exceeded on all fronts. When we acquired the Abbott EPD business, they were showing kind of a trajectory of a flat to declining business and we said, it's not about what the business is doing on a standalone, but what we believe we can do with that business. And I think we were able to show last year that we turned that to a flat to increasing in business. And then as we look at bringing on Meda and Renaissance, we continue to see our ability to leverage now the infrastructure around these countries that are allowing us to maximize the products that each of these acquisitions brought us, the Mylan legacy, the Abbott, as well as now with Meda. And so we continue to see our ability to get more out of that asset than they were doing on a standalone basis in conjunction with our existing businesses. So, yeah, we couldn't be more pleased and I think we will continue to bear fruit, the results in our really integrating Mylan and leveraging this platform will continue to show in our results. Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV And, Umer, thank you for the question. I actually should have answered it because it was in Jami's queue of questions a little bit earlier. Yes, the componentry of the revenue guidance we're reaffirming as well. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV And, Umer, Vytorin launch has been impacted by the Nashik warning letter. Operator And our next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks very much. Hi, Heather and team. I have three questions, please. The first is, with respect to the U.S. price decline commentary, could you just educate us on how you calculate that? I know that Teva I think at one point was excluding price declines associated with competition after first-to-file products face competition, for example. And also I've heard that some generic companies exclude it when they have to discontinue a product due to price decline, they exclude that from their price calculation. So, if you could just educate us on how you calculate U.S. price declines, that would be helpful. Second, with respect to Biocon, could you please review the economics, how Mylan books revenue and profits associated with Biocon products? And I'm guessing that may differ by geography. And then, finally, you disclosed global Meda and Renaissance revenue of $606 million. Now last year, we had run rates, and I thought these were provided by the company, or I'm not sure where we got these from, but we had a total revenue run rate of about $650 million from the two. That was $555 million from Meda and $95 million from Renaissance. So just wanted to see if indeed those numbers are accurate and the business has decreased maybe due to divestitures. Any more color on that would be helpful. Thank you. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV Okay, David. I'll maybe take some at a high level and then others can chime in. I'll start with the acquisitions. Look, as we've done for this quarter and we will do this year is break out acquisitions and that contribution. I think I'm not sure where your numbers are – if those are old numbers, but what I will tell you, again, it's what we're doing with the asset in combination. So while we're breaking out for one year post-acquisitions to give that visibility on our legacy business to try to start now dissecting between the acquisitions, I don't think would be useful because it's really what we're being able to drive out of this asset in totality that is driving the results that you're seeing. As far as Biocon, I don't believe we've given the contractual relationship. What I can tell you, obviously, we have a very important partnership with Biocon and continue to be very happy with the performance both in the products that are already approved in marketing and those that are in the pipeline. So that continues to be a very important partnership. And as far as price decline, I think, Tony laid it out. I don't know if there is any other visibility. But I think that's why we try to give the dynamics around the fact that – where you have a first-to-market opportunity and you're the only player in the market and then there's five or six players in the market overnight, that certainly can drive a little bit of anomaly and volatility as you look at a year or comparisons year over year, which is the point we were trying to make. However, all products in and looking at everything across our globe, we're still saying our generic price erosion is in mid-single digits without excluding anything. Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV Heather, I think you said it very well. David, our U.S. price erosion methodology really is about like-to-like from a year-over-year perspective. And the one thing we were noting, yes, we feel very strongly about mid-single digits globally. And in the U.S. in 2016, we had several meaningful first-to-market launches that certainly don't have the same valuation in the corresponding period for 2017. So we wanted to note what that base business corrosion would be without those in it. Operator And our next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Your line is open. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC Yes, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about Europe a little bit and just describe the trends that you're seeing there. Have there been any major changes in any of the key markets that you're in. And maybe you can also talk about changes from a government perspective, pricing perspective, any major stuff. And then if you could, just talk about your performance in some of your key markets. Thank you. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV So I'll just start. I would say that, Marc, this is one of the areas where I think you really see the strategic acquisitions really paying dividends. When you look at the Mylan legacy business now with Abbott and Meda and those assets both from a geographical portfolio perspective that we've been able to pull together, and as I mentioned in my commentary, really gives us the unique go-to-market in these country strategies. You have seen us continue to bolster our number one position in France, and I would say Italy is closing in on and we currently are number one in Italy. So you've seen us really strengthen the strong positions we've had. And in addition to that, some of these up and coming markets that Meda brought us to really bring critical mass where we see nothing but opportunity from places like UK and some of these areas where now we have a very robust product portfolio and a really strong sales infrastructure to maximize. So I don't know, Tony and Rajiv, any other countries, but I just couldn't be more pleased myself with what these assets coming together and what our team has been able to yield. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV And I think that one of the questions was do we see any more government instituted price cuts and all that. No, Marc, we don't see at this time what we saw a few years back. And this Meda acquisition and Abbott acquisition has so well positioned us to leverage anything we drop in and add on to that platform now. Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV And maybe just to close, we do feel very good about the growth we've seen in our leadership markets in France and Italy as well, as some of the up and coming, like Heather said, UK, Germany, Poland, and Nordics, all of them did well. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Your line is open. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I've got three. First one staying around with the same of Europe, can you just describe the natural seasonality of revenue and operating profit from that region? There clearly is some significant one with lower contribution in the first quarter. Just help us figure out what the gross margin will be throughout the year. Second, we've noticed a decline if you look at IMS in just your total generic volume. I guess both sequentially and year over year about 5%. Can you talk a little bit about when you decide it's about time to stop selling particular products? Is it something we should expect a strategic direction the company is taking to walk away from unprofitable business? And then last, obviously one of the things we're trying to do always is cross over between the previous quarter and this quarter. Can you help us understand a little bit the contribution decline from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the one quarter of 2017 of the new product launch in the fourth quarter, just so we have an ability to separate the baseline from differentiated products? Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV Okay. So, Ronny, let me try. I'm not sure I quite understand your seasonality of the first question. You look at our global business today, over half of which is coming from outside of the United States, and the fact that we've got over 2,000 products on the market, there's not a real seasonality. With that being said, I think Ken at Investor Day laid out what we saw corresponding quarters and proportionality from 2016 to 2017 that would help for modeling purposes if you look at the percentage of the businesses. So again, I think what we couldn't be more excited about is the resiliency of this platform and the fact that the seasonality for any product or given market, we're able to now really absorb that and show this contribution continuing to grow in a meaningful way and not being so much subjected to seasonality. Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV And so if you think about that, because I know what you're trying to get to, which is as we move through the year, how do you look at gross margins. What we told you about the first quarter was gross margins were down 60 basis points year over year, and that is consistent with what we projected and gave you an outlook for, for the full year. So even though seasonality may move around a bit, and you've followed us long enough to know that the second half is a bigger half than the first half is, we don't see a significant amount of variation in that. We saw in the first quarter what we have an outlook for, for the year. Specifically, as far as new product introductions, new product launches this year we indicated would be heavier obviously in the second half. Last year, I would say if you're looking at fourth quarter to first quarter, not significantly different because they were lighter new product launch quarters. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV And just on your point about unprofitable business, I would say, I try to state in my opening remarks, we've had a long history of being committed to a very broad portfolio. And as we've said, we have over – just even here in the United States over 630 products at an average selling base of $0.25. So there's a lot that goes into that mix. And we've continued to be committed to mean the most to our customers, and we'll continue to look at that. But I will tell you that meaning the most to our customers and having a robust portfolio is important. But that's not to say that we don't evaluate. And if something doesn't make sense at a certain period of time, certainly I think by the sheer number of what we've got in the market, it should suggest that we're very committed to continuing to offer a broad range of products. Operator And our next question comes from Andrew Finkelstein from Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open. Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a bit more about in terms of pricing how the relationship is evolving with the large customers. You talked about the importance of the differentiation of your scale. But does that mean a different conversation than some of the smaller players have? One of your competitors this morning talked about the consortiums coming around to understanding the need to support as partners, companies that are in generics for the long term. So does that play into your pricing expectations and also what tends to be a more back-half weighted U.S. generics revenue figure? And then secondly on business development. You talked about at the Investor Day having a number of potential opportunities this year. Can you comment at all just about how the environment is evolving and how you think about valuing assets and being able to forecast the prospects for these assets or companies in an environment of some uncertainty? Thanks. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV Andrew, thank you. And thank you for your questions. I think what we've continued to say and what we continue to see is it absolutely is driving a different conversation. And as the external environment has been in, I'll call it, chaos and we've seen these cycles before over the last couple of decades that it really provides an opportunity for people to really do work about a company, their portfolio, their platform and that all generic companies aren't created equally, all branded companies aren't created equally, and all hybrid companies aren't created equally. And I think what we've continued to show is that the assets that we've pulled together on a global basis have allowed us to drive not only a different conversation but a reliable supply chain. Our commitment to generics over the past 55 years and certainly the investment we've made in important complex generics, like generic Advair and our biosimilars, was one of the largest pipelines in the industry. So not only do our customers see us as valuable to be able to have a global partnership, but certainly our pipeline drives much of that conversation and relationship and the importance that we are to each other. So I absolutely can't underscore enough that how the platform and our differentiation is absolutely allowing us to have very different conversations than if we were just in one country with a niche portfolio. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV And, Andrew, regarding business development, we are executing to the plan, which we shared with you on our Investor Day. We have a very exciting and active and rich pipeline, which we are trying to close certain deals and bring products home. So we see many tuck-in opportunities out there. Operator And our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, thanks very much. Just a couple of questions here. Just circling back to Advair, would you be able to make the low end of your 2017 EPS guidance range in the event that Advair was delayed out to 2018? I know you usually don't comment on specific products, but just given the focus on this one, I think that would be helpful. My second question also on Advair, if your dialogue with FDA is unsuccessful, can you just give us some rough timelines on how we should think about a generic Advair approval? Is mid 2018 a reasonable timeframe to think about it, if you are unsuccessful? And my final question was actually shifting gears to biosimilars and biosimilar Neulasta in the U.S., it seems like a large and very attractive market. Is that something that could be a contributor for you in 2018 or are there still IP hurdles we need to think about there, assuming you're approved later this year? Thanks so much. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV All right. Thank you, Chris. And I'll start. This is – yes, our EPS guidance range that we've reiterated this morning and I put in my commentary is not dependent on approval of any one product, to your point. Approvals are important – are an important part of our business and we have a lot of moving pieces and parts in our guidance. So I wanted to certainly point out, it's not – that range is not reliant on any one approval. So I think that's the point of having the range and thus being able to come out and reiterate that we're committed to this guidance range. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV And, Chris, as I earlier mentioned, it will be prudent for us to wait for this dialogue before we comment on the potential impact on any timing our Advair launch. And with regarding your question on Neulasta, you can expect us to have this product end of – towards the end of 2018 or early 2019. Operator And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV All right. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV Thank you. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV Thank you, everyone.

And our first question comes from Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James. Your line is open. Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks, good morning. First question for Heather, Rajiv, Tony. I guess specifically with respect to the evolving consortium dynamics and particularly the McKesson-Walmart collaboration, a lot of small to mid-sized manufacturers have pointed to this dynamic as having a significant negative impact on their business or at least creating a potential to having a significant negative impact on their business. I'm just wondering what Mylan's position is on the evolution of that particular consortium, whether or not you're actually seeing a current impact or this is something that you think is going to play out over the next couple of quarters, and then just maybe conceptually how much risk that creates around your mid-single-digit pricing erosion assumption. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV Okay, Elliot. Thanks. I'll start off and then Rajiv or Tony can chime in. Elliot, I think this is no different than the consolidation we've seen over the last several years. When you look at our customer base, the consolidation, especially from a global perspective, what we've said then and remains true today is that consolidation is really a benefit to a company like ours at Mylan, given our portfolio, our breadth. and our geographical reach, our ability to not only supply the level of demand that is needed but to be able to do so on a global basis. And I think what we've seen as a continued strength as these customers have consolidated our ability to really leverage our entire portfolio as well as our pipeline. We've got some important products coming. And what I would say is I can appreciate some of the players that are in one country or geographically landlocked or from a product perspective not being able to meet some of the supply and demand needed on a global basis. So I think this further underscores Mylan's differentiated and diversified platform and is allowing us to meet and exceed quite honestly what we have done in the past with some of these players as they're looking at a different business model. Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV Thanks, Heather. And, Elliot, yes, historically we've seen consolidation and the consolidation of businesses and aggregating these models together have some effect on erosion. What we continue to see, though, is that we have this differentiated platform with a diverse portfolio of products, best-in-class service levels, and the inclusion of new products into this mix in terms of always adding to what we've had. So we're excited to service McKesson, Walmart, and all our customers, and we want to mean more to them in the future. So I think that scale along with our geographic overlap plays a very important role into our success in that business. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV And I would just add that we have taken into consideration this alliance into our projections. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV And that reminded me and, Elliot, I don't think we can underscore this enough, we mentioned this at Investor Day, but the continuity of our management team. We've been together over a decade working with these customers and bringing that leadership. And I think as we look at all that's happening externally and the environment around us, that's continued to play a critical role in our ability to leverage our business. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Gary Nachman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gary Nachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi, good morning. On generic Advair, can you give some more color at a high level on what the key differences are between you and FDA? What areas are they focused on? And then it sounds like timing is a bit up in the air. When do you think you will be able to meet with them? And on Copaxone, just describe your readiness to launch that product, both the 20-milligram and the 40-milligram, if you actually get the approval at the action date next month. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV So let me take the easy one first, which is Copaxone, and just talk about our readiness. Yes, you will expect us to be in a state of readiness from the manufacturing point of view – from commercial manufacturing point of view in anticipation of the target action dates. Regarding generic Advair, so let me reiterate that this submission was done in complete accordance to the product-specific guidance and pre-agreed protocols. And we have not been asked to do any additional clinical endpoints or device-related studies at this juncture. What we have been asked is now that some of the studies, especially the device-related studies, we have now been asked to analyze and report our findings of our study against the newly issued industry draft guidance for conduct of human practice studies – draft guidance. So that's what we want to go back and discuss with FDA, and we can get this meeting any day. We have been waiting for this meeting and it can happen any moment or any day. And we can only comment upon the potential impact of the CRL once we have these discussions behind us. So that's what we are waiting for before we comment upon any impact on timing. Operator And our next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Ken, maybe for you, and I just want to say I do appreciate the increased transparency. We always want more, though. And based on our math, it seems that most of the miss in North America was EpiPen. And if you could, just confirm that that was the case. Based on triangulating your numbers, it seems that EpiPen came in at around $123 million, which was well below what we were thinking. And I'm just wondering if that's related to the recall. Is that the new level of sales that we should expect? Will that continue to erode? Help us to think about that. And secondly in terms of your revenue guide, which I don't know that I heard you reiterate – if you do want to, this is a good opportunity. If not, that says something too. But to hit the low end of your revenue guide would seem to require about $350 million in the new product sales. I think you had talked about $850 million in new product sales at your Analyst Day. So obviously, some things work; some things don't work. But if you could comment on that math, I would appreciate it. Thanks. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV All right. Jami, I first have to jump in and just say thank you for the acknowledgment on transparency. As we said, many of us have had many discussions. And we told you, I personally said that, look, I want to continue to try to give the right visibility into this business. That's what we're here to do. We've got a lot of moving pieces and parts. We're trying to be reflective of how we're running and driving this business, which is completely leveraging all of these channels from generic brands and branded generics and OTCs and how we're leveraging those in country. So I really appreciate your recognition of that, and we're going to continue to do so. And the one thing I'll just say on EpiPen and then I'll let Ken get into some of the financials is that, as we said on Investor Day, Jami, we anticipated a big change in EpiPen, and we knew that it would continue to be a mix between the AG and the brand and we continue to see that conversion. But the reality is people had a very strong loyalty to the brand EpiPen and it's continued to be an education to let them know that it's the same product. But what I will say about EpiPen, it's what we expected, and obviously that continues to be into the guidance that we reiterated this morning. Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV I'll also say thank you for the comment because we are truly the way we put the release together and including providing you a number for North America excluding EpiPen, we'll still allow you to have that visibility into what's going on with the EpiPen product. With that number, you've done the math, you can model it, you're right in the ballpark. As far as projecting out the year, we don't give any quarterly kind of run rate on EpiPen. But as Heather said, what happened in the quarter was very consistent with what we expected. The recall did occur. We've disclosed both in the Q and in our commentary that the costs of the recall are recoverable. That has driven a little bit of change in trend and some of the sales number, but nothing of significance. But to reiterate, we said at Investor Day that year-over-year EpiPen profitability at the operating profit level will be down $400 million year over year, a huge number. $500 million at the gross profit level, offset by some reduction in spending in sales and marketing. And that's exactly where we're moving through right now. So, you've done the math, you're right in the right ballpark, and everything is exactly how we expected it. As far as new products, we said we'd have $850 million of contribution this year year-over-year for new products. And at this point in time, we're working towards that roadmap. It's a long list of products. And whether it would be at the low end, the mid, we're generating those new product launches in order to drive to $850 million. Operator And our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thanks, team. In the interest of transparency, have you thought about giving an EPS target for next year that does not include the help of capital deployments? And then for Rajiv, two quick ones, one on Advair. Your comments seem to suggest you're not confident that your data would fit with the draft guidance. Maybe I misread that. But could you state how you feel about the draft guidance as a potential stumbling block? And on biosimilar Lantus or glargine, can you talk about the legal and regulatory steps between now and launch? I believe there's a stay at a minimum. Thanks. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV All right, Gregg. Thanks. I'll start and then I'll let Rajiv take on the products. I guess Gregg, what I would say, I am not sure how somebody gives guidance without talking about capital deployment, whether that's in business development opportunities. I think we were very clear and transparent on Investor Day of what we said of our assumptions leading to that $6 target that we continue to walk through over the last five years. And that deployment of cash while maintaining our balance sheet being able to bolt-on important product acquisitions, as we've done already this year and we'll continue to do so. So, look, we continue to be executing towards the roadmap that we laid out in March and we'll continue to update as appropriately. But what we laid out on Investor Day is what we're executing against. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV Yeah, Gregg, on Advair, I mean, there is nothing in my voice you should hear that we don't feel comfortable about interpreting our data to the new guidance, but we have a difference of opinion at a policy level that agency is applying a draft guidance as against a pre-approved or pre-agreed protocol. So that's what we're trying to discuss and negotiate with them because it all adds to the timing and the classification of the CRL. Second, on Lantus, we are very much on track and you should expect to hear from us anytime now about our regulatory filing in USA. Operator And our next question comes from Douglas Tsao from Barclays. Your line is open. Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So just, Rajiv, not to sort of beat a dead horse, but just following up on Advair again. Maybe if you could just walk through what the sort of the next steps are for you providing some – or providing the Street some clarity in terms of the roadmap forward and resolving the sort of difference of opinion? And would you pursue or think about pursuing sort of like dispute resolution within the agency? Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV It's too early for us. We have sought a meeting and we have been told that FDA is working on to grant us a meeting, or very soon we'll hear from them. And I don't want to comment anything beyond that. We should be able to be in a good position to talk about it once we have this meeting behind us. Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. And then just in terms of the warning letter at the Nashik plant, I believe that was primarily antiretrovirals. Just curious if it was limited to that. And has the warning letter had any impact on potential approvals converting to final that you might have had tentatives on? Thank you. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV Nashik is not limited to antiretrovirals. Nashik is a global site and does produce some U.S. products and some of the U.S. launches will be potentially impacted by that. But as I confirmed, they are not material to our overall Mylan's business. Operator And our next question comes from Tim Chiang from BTIG. Your line is open. Tim Chiang - BTIG LLC Hi, Rajiv. Just one last follow-up question on Advair. In assuming that you go down the pathway with the FDA and you still have this disagreement on the draft guidance, would you guys consider still trying to launch your product, but launch it without an AB rating, just go as a 505(b)(2) or launch it as a branded generic? Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV No. There's no discussion in this complete response letter or a point being made about this being not 505(j) or being about 505(b)(2). And we don't see because it is exactly – the product is exactly as per the guidance issue by the FDA. It has been accepted as 505(j). So I don't want to even think and comment about that because it's not real. So I don't want to speculate on that. Operator And our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Heather, I have a few, if I may. Heather, you mentioned acquisitions are exceeding expectations and I wanted to clarify, was that a comment directed at Meda, Renaissance or also at the Abbott EPD. Ken, perhaps, a quick clarification on your end. I know you're reiterating EPS guidance. Are you also reiterating revenue guidance? Just wanted to confirm that. And then, Rajiv, we noticed Vytorin and Seroquel XR approvals for some of your competitors, but haven't seen that press release from you guys yet. So I just wanted to understand what the cause for the delay was or is there anything at any specific facility we should be aware of? And I just wanted to stop there. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV Okay, all right. Hi, Umer. I would say we exceeded on all fronts. When we acquired the Abbott EPD business, they were showing kind of a trajectory of a flat to declining business and we said, it's not about what the business is doing on a standalone, but what we believe we can do with that business. And I think we were able to show last year that we turned that to a flat to increasing in business. And then as we look at bringing on Meda and Renaissance, we continue to see our ability to leverage now the infrastructure around these countries that are allowing us to maximize the products that each of these acquisitions brought us, the Mylan legacy, the Abbott, as well as now with Meda. And so we continue to see our ability to get more out of that asset than they were doing on a standalone basis in conjunction with our existing businesses. So, yeah, we couldn't be more pleased and I think we will continue to bear fruit, the results in our really integrating Mylan and leveraging this platform will continue to show in our results. Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV And, Umer, thank you for the question. I actually should have answered it because it was in Jami's queue of questions a little bit earlier. Yes, the componentry of the revenue guidance we're reaffirming as well. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV And, Umer, Vytorin launch has been impacted by the Nashik warning letter. Operator And our next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks very much. Hi, Heather and team. I have three questions, please. The first is, with respect to the U.S. price decline commentary, could you just educate us on how you calculate that? I know that Teva I think at one point was excluding price declines associated with competition after first-to-file products face competition, for example. And also I've heard that some generic companies exclude it when they have to discontinue a product due to price decline, they exclude that from their price calculation. So, if you could just educate us on how you calculate U.S. price declines, that would be helpful. Second, with respect to Biocon, could you please review the economics, how Mylan books revenue and profits associated with Biocon products? And I'm guessing that may differ by geography. And then, finally, you disclosed global Meda and Renaissance revenue of $606 million. Now last year, we had run rates, and I thought these were provided by the company, or I'm not sure where we got these from, but we had a total revenue run rate of about $650 million from the two. That was $555 million from Meda and $95 million from Renaissance. So just wanted to see if indeed those numbers are accurate and the business has decreased maybe due to divestitures. Any more color on that would be helpful. Thank you. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV Okay, David. I'll maybe take some at a high level and then others can chime in. I'll start with the acquisitions. Look, as we've done for this quarter and we will do this year is break out acquisitions and that contribution. I think I'm not sure where your numbers are – if those are old numbers, but what I will tell you, again, it's what we're doing with the asset in combination. So while we're breaking out for one year post-acquisitions to give that visibility on our legacy business to try to start now dissecting between the acquisitions, I don't think would be useful because it's really what we're being able to drive out of this asset in totality that is driving the results that you're seeing. As far as Biocon, I don't believe we've given the contractual relationship. What I can tell you, obviously, we have a very important partnership with Biocon and continue to be very happy with the performance both in the products that are already approved in marketing and those that are in the pipeline. So that continues to be a very important partnership. And as far as price decline, I think, Tony laid it out. I don't know if there is any other visibility. But I think that's why we try to give the dynamics around the fact that – where you have a first-to-market opportunity and you're the only player in the market and then there's five or six players in the market overnight, that certainly can drive a little bit of anomaly and volatility as you look at a year or comparisons year over year, which is the point we were trying to make. However, all products in and looking at everything across our globe, we're still saying our generic price erosion is in mid-single digits without excluding anything. Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV Heather, I think you said it very well. David, our U.S. price erosion methodology really is about like-to-like from a year-over-year perspective. And the one thing we were noting, yes, we feel very strongly about mid-single digits globally. And in the U.S. in 2016, we had several meaningful first-to-market launches that certainly don't have the same valuation in the corresponding period for 2017. So we wanted to note what that base business corrosion would be without those in it. Operator And our next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Your line is open. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC Yes, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about Europe a little bit and just describe the trends that you're seeing there. Have there been any major changes in any of the key markets that you're in. And maybe you can also talk about changes from a government perspective, pricing perspective, any major stuff. And then if you could, just talk about your performance in some of your key markets. Thank you. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV So I'll just start. I would say that, Marc, this is one of the areas where I think you really see the strategic acquisitions really paying dividends. When you look at the Mylan legacy business now with Abbott and Meda and those assets both from a geographical portfolio perspective that we've been able to pull together, and as I mentioned in my commentary, really gives us the unique go-to-market in these country strategies. You have seen us continue to bolster our number one position in France, and I would say Italy is closing in on and we currently are number one in Italy. So you've seen us really strengthen the strong positions we've had. And in addition to that, some of these up and coming markets that Meda brought us to really bring critical mass where we see nothing but opportunity from places like UK and some of these areas where now we have a very robust product portfolio and a really strong sales infrastructure to maximize. So I don't know, Tony and Rajiv, any other countries, but I just couldn't be more pleased myself with what these assets coming together and what our team has been able to yield. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV And I think that one of the questions was do we see any more government instituted price cuts and all that. No, Marc, we don't see at this time what we saw a few years back. And this Meda acquisition and Abbott acquisition has so well positioned us to leverage anything we drop in and add on to that platform now. Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV And maybe just to close, we do feel very good about the growth we've seen in our leadership markets in France and Italy as well, as some of the up and coming, like Heather said, UK, Germany, Poland, and Nordics, all of them did well. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Your line is open. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I've got three. First one staying around with the same of Europe, can you just describe the natural seasonality of revenue and operating profit from that region? There clearly is some significant one with lower contribution in the first quarter. Just help us figure out what the gross margin will be throughout the year. Second, we've noticed a decline if you look at IMS in just your total generic volume. I guess both sequentially and year over year about 5%. Can you talk a little bit about when you decide it's about time to stop selling particular products? Is it something we should expect a strategic direction the company is taking to walk away from unprofitable business? And then last, obviously one of the things we're trying to do always is cross over between the previous quarter and this quarter. Can you help us understand a little bit the contribution decline from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the one quarter of 2017 of the new product launch in the fourth quarter, just so we have an ability to separate the baseline from differentiated products? Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV Okay. So, Ronny, let me try. I'm not sure I quite understand your seasonality of the first question. You look at our global business today, over half of which is coming from outside of the United States, and the fact that we've got over 2,000 products on the market, there's not a real seasonality. With that being said, I think Ken at Investor Day laid out what we saw corresponding quarters and proportionality from 2016 to 2017 that would help for modeling purposes if you look at the percentage of the businesses. So again, I think what we couldn't be more excited about is the resiliency of this platform and the fact that the seasonality for any product or given market, we're able to now really absorb that and show this contribution continuing to grow in a meaningful way and not being so much subjected to seasonality. Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV And so if you think about that, because I know what you're trying to get to, which is as we move through the year, how do you look at gross margins. What we told you about the first quarter was gross margins were down 60 basis points year over year, and that is consistent with what we projected and gave you an outlook for, for the full year. So even though seasonality may move around a bit, and you've followed us long enough to know that the second half is a bigger half than the first half is, we don't see a significant amount of variation in that. We saw in the first quarter what we have an outlook for, for the year. Specifically, as far as new product introductions, new product launches this year we indicated would be heavier obviously in the second half. Last year, I would say if you're looking at fourth quarter to first quarter, not significantly different because they were lighter new product launch quarters. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV And just on your point about unprofitable business, I would say, I try to state in my opening remarks, we've had a long history of being committed to a very broad portfolio. And as we've said, we have over – just even here in the United States over 630 products at an average selling base of $0.25. So there's a lot that goes into that mix. And we've continued to be committed to mean the most to our customers, and we'll continue to look at that. But I will tell you that meaning the most to our customers and having a robust portfolio is important. But that's not to say that we don't evaluate. And if something doesn't make sense at a certain period of time, certainly I think by the sheer number of what we've got in the market, it should suggest that we're very committed to continuing to offer a broad range of products. Operator And our next question comes from Andrew Finkelstein from Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open. Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a bit more about in terms of pricing how the relationship is evolving with the large customers. You talked about the importance of the differentiation of your scale. But does that mean a different conversation than some of the smaller players have? One of your competitors this morning talked about the consortiums coming around to understanding the need to support as partners, companies that are in generics for the long term. So does that play into your pricing expectations and also what tends to be a more back-half weighted U.S. generics revenue figure? And then secondly on business development. You talked about at the Investor Day having a number of potential opportunities this year. Can you comment at all just about how the environment is evolving and how you think about valuing assets and being able to forecast the prospects for these assets or companies in an environment of some uncertainty? Thanks. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV Andrew, thank you. And thank you for your questions. I think what we've continued to say and what we continue to see is it absolutely is driving a different conversation. And as the external environment has been in, I'll call it, chaos and we've seen these cycles before over the last couple of decades that it really provides an opportunity for people to really do work about a company, their portfolio, their platform and that all generic companies aren't created equally, all branded companies aren't created equally, and all hybrid companies aren't created equally. And I think what we've continued to show is that the assets that we've pulled together on a global basis have allowed us to drive not only a different conversation but a reliable supply chain. Our commitment to generics over the past 55 years and certainly the investment we've made in important complex generics, like generic Advair and our biosimilars, was one of the largest pipelines in the industry. So not only do our customers see us as valuable to be able to have a global partnership, but certainly our pipeline drives much of that conversation and relationship and the importance that we are to each other. So I absolutely can't underscore enough that how the platform and our differentiation is absolutely allowing us to have very different conversations than if we were just in one country with a niche portfolio. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV And, Andrew, regarding business development, we are executing to the plan, which we shared with you on our Investor Day. We have a very exciting and active and rich pipeline, which we are trying to close certain deals and bring products home. So we see many tuck-in opportunities out there. Operator And our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, thanks very much. Just a couple of questions here. Just circling back to Advair, would you be able to make the low end of your 2017 EPS guidance range in the event that Advair was delayed out to 2018? I know you usually don't comment on specific products, but just given the focus on this one, I think that would be helpful. My second question also on Advair, if your dialogue with FDA is unsuccessful, can you just give us some rough timelines on how we should think about a generic Advair approval? Is mid 2018 a reasonable timeframe to think about it, if you are unsuccessful? And my final question was actually shifting gears to biosimilars and biosimilar Neulasta in the U.S., it seems like a large and very attractive market. Is that something that could be a contributor for you in 2018 or are there still IP hurdles we need to think about there, assuming you're approved later this year? Thanks so much. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV All right. Thank you, Chris. And I'll start. This is – yes, our EPS guidance range that we've reiterated this morning and I put in my commentary is not dependent on approval of any one product, to your point. Approvals are important – are an important part of our business and we have a lot of moving pieces and parts in our guidance. So I wanted to certainly point out, it's not – that range is not reliant on any one approval. So I think that's the point of having the range and thus being able to come out and reiterate that we're committed to this guidance range. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV And, Chris, as I earlier mentioned, it will be prudent for us to wait for this dialogue before we comment on the potential impact on any timing our Advair launch. And with regarding your question on Neulasta, you can expect us to have this product end of – towards the end of 2018 or early 2019. Operator And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV All right. Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV Thank you. Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV Thank you, everyone.

(NASDAQ: NFLX ) Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call April 17, 2017 6:00 PM ET Executives David Wells - Chief Financial Officer Reed Hastings - Founder and Chief Executive Officer Ted Sarandos - Chief Content Officer Analysts Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus & Company David Wells Welcome to the Netflix Q1 2017 Earnings Interview. I’m David Wells, CFO. I’m Joined today on the company side by Reed Hastings, our CEO and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer. Interviewing us today will be Doug Mitchelson from UBS and Scott Devitt from Stifel Nicolaus. We will be making forward-looking statements, actual results may vary. Doug, I think you have the first question, so over to Doug. Question-and-Answer Session Q - Doug Mitchelson Thanks so much. Actually, first question for you, David, and then one for Reed. David, could you just talk a little bit about the net add results in the quarter versus expectations, and any dynamics underline the second quarter guidance that you want investors to know about? David Wells Well, I think what’s written in the letter and what I’ll reiterate is that, we’re not spending too much time understanding any particular quarter. We were with under 100,000 in the U.S. under a couple of 100,000 in the international versus our expectation. We had a particularly back-weighted first quarter, which were - we don’t usually have, but that explains some of the sort of net adds guidance versus actuals as well, and we have a pretty strong guide for Q1. So I think looking at our Q4, which is one of our strongest quarters ever and a pretty strong Q2 guide, we sort of look across that like we put in the letter and say, we’re still on a great growth path, and our content is working. And we’re pleased with the international growth and we’ve got a lot of growth left in the U.S. as well. Doug Mitchelson I mean, is there anything you would highlight in the second quarter in terms of an easy comparison. Last year, you talked about price increase buzz in the press, having a negative impact on U.S. dynamics, the content slate, anything you highlight driving the result? David Wells Well, the obvious one to talk about in total, talk about in more detail is the content slate. We talked in our dissent - in the January letter about House of Cards pushing into the second quarter. We’ve got a particularly full slate in Q2, which relative to Q1 is a little heavier, and then that’s comping off of last year’s Q1, we had a pretty strong Q1 as well. So I think that sort of explains some of it on the margin. But I think the background trend is just a very strong adoption of Internet streaming. So again, if you look across 12 months trend, we still got a lot of great growth. We’re growing well on track in international. We’re continuing to growing in the U.S. And quarter-to-quarter, you’ll see some fluctuations and some of that is explained by the content slate. Doug Mitchelson And Reed, upfront I want to turn to you at a high-level. I think you mentioned in the letter about to cross the 100 million subscribers mark, you’re about a decade into this. And I think in the last quarter’s letter, you talked about the next 10 years being tumultuous. And I was hoping you’d talk a little bit about what you meant by using that word in particular, and what are the challenges and opportunities as you look out over the next decade and target that next 100 million subscribers? Reed Hastings Well, I’m - we’re super excited expecting to cross 100 million this weekend, that’s a big accomplishment. But it’s really just the beginning. When you look at YouTube having a billion active users and a billion hours every day. When you look at Facebook’s, multi-billion numbers. We see that the Internet is just a phenomenal opportunity, of course, we’re pay service, not ad supported. We’re not as deep in international as those companies. But we definitely see a big opportunity around the world to just continue to do what we’ve been doing, which is make fantastic content, get people really excited about that content, and then we’re just continuing to grow. Doug Mitchelson Great. Thanks. Scott Devitt And just continuing on the roll of content, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the way that content releases do impact seasonality of the business, and as well new releases of new shows, say a Dave Chappelle’s show relative to say Season 5 of the House of Cards and the different impacts on gross and net subs? Thanks. Ted Sarandos Scott, I would just say, we’ve said previously that subsequent seasons of shows that have a big audience that are very popular tend to have more impact on the business than introducing brand new IP. So that’s why in the second quarter you’re seeing new seasons of some of our most popular and most acclaimed shows like House of Cards, Orange is the new Black, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Bloodline, Master of None. And in the first quarter, it was pretty heavy on new IP, but we’re super pleased to have such a big breakout on 13 Reasons why we just came on the last day of the quarter as well as Santa Clarita Diet, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Iron Fist, first season shows, and then something like Dave Chappelle comes along and it’s in its own class in terms of excitement for consumers in viewing and excitement around Netflix and now we’re looking for David - a third special from David next year. Reed Hastings And since then you can think of that content is making a little trickier to do the quarterly forecasting. But for the first-half of this year, we’re about 8.25 million net adds, which is what we were last year. So again, it moves itself around levels out. So I wouldn’t get too focused on predicting each quarter by the content. We’re continuing to learn on that. But mostly, we’re just trying to do better and better shows that are more and more popular. Scott Devitt And then as it relates to the international business, you noted some markets that are doing extremely well outside the U.S. and other markets that are still progressing. Can you talk about particularly in some of the larger markets where you feel like you’re underpenetrated where the largest sources of friction are increasing the subscriber base in those markets? David Wells So I would say I’ll pitch it to Reed afterward. It’s not necessarily a source of friction. I mean, we were pretty careful about not talking about specifics by market for competitive reasons. But we have said that, we experience a wide variety of adoption curves in different markets. We’ve seen some markets come out of the gate really fast. We some - we’ve seen some that have grown slowly and that really caught up and seen a great acceleration. So I would say, each market is different. Each one seems to have a different word-of-mouth, adoption pattern. But increasingly what’s new for us is that, we’re more and more global. And the more that we can release these shows that have wide global appeal, we’re getting sort of the benefit of that wide global word-of-mouth and the network effect of that that great scale, I mean, growing to 100 million and beyond. Global subscribers is really going to benefit us in having these shows that travel across multiple markets. So I think, we’re not particularly focused on any one challenge in the larger markets, I think it’s about continuing to make payments available, continuing to improve the product, continuing to improve the continent in that market with our global originals being the largest part of that. And then Reed, I don’t know, if you want to tack on anything there. Reed Hastings Yes, Scott, as you might remember, first, couple of years in Brazil, we were struggling with number of the aspects in particular getting the right content, where our service was getting watched a lot. I think it’s pretty parallel to that and of course, not every market is the same as Brazil, we have to learn market by market. But it’s nothing that’s very concerning to us. It’s just a note that in three of the regions LATAM, Europe and North America, we’ve got the formula we’re executing down. And in Asia, Middle East and Africa, we still got a bunch of work to do, particularly around getting enough of the right content that people want to view that we get our viewing hours higher and higher. Scott Devitt And just a follow on to the international topic. There have been several markets where you’ve launched non-U.S. originals. And I was interested in terms of the difficulties or ease with which you’re having in finding talent in those markets? And then secondly, in those markets in which you’re launching originals, the benefit in terms of the halo effect of the other markets actually latching onto that continent and viewing it, that’s driving the subscribers in those markets as well? Ted Sarandos Well, I could tell you about, we launched this past quarter Ingobernable, which is a Spanish language original Starring Kate del Castillo, that had a huge impact on us throughout Latin America, but also outside of Latin America and throughout the Spanish speaking world. And our ability to get in learn the production infrastructure, learn the - get to know the talent, have the talent get to know us, that’s one of those things that gets a nice accelerator as Netflix becomes better and better known around the world that the top talent in those markets want their shows on Netflix. So nothing is easy, but that that is something that we’ve had a lot of good fortune with finding the great town and the great shows locally, and it has been having a lot of impact outside of the country of origin. Scott Devitt Thank you. Doug Mitchelson The international arena is a pretty rich topic, but I want to move back to the U.S. But first, Reed, you mentioned consumption. I think investors would love to have an update on consumption both in the U.S. and overseas. What is the hours per day on average? Is it still growing for both cohorts year-to-year? Anything you’re willing to share at this point in time? Reed Hastings Yes, viewing is very large and growing, but nowhere near as big as YouTube. So we definitely got YouTube envy and we’ve got a lot a room to go. And some of the new shows like Ted was talking about, our movie out of Korea [indiscernible] has great global potential. So, we’re finding great talent around the world and that’s what drives up the viewing. Doug Mitchelson So I also wanted to hit on the U.S. And so even though a lot of the growth comes from international When you think about the U.S., a lot of investors are worried about the maturity and whether that sends a signal that you could ultimately have some issues with penetrations overseas. And I think, Reed, it starts with you and the vision for 60 million, 90 million subs, is that still the vision? Ted is part of that. What you have to do to execute on getting those subscribers that lead us looking for? And for David, on that topic, is there anything you see in the trends? I know you want us to not to dig into gross adds and churn on a quarterly basis too much, but it’s sort of what we do. Is there anything that you’re seeing that suggests there’s a majority wall coming anytime soon for the U.S.?Thanks. Reed Hastings U.S. market is continuing to grow very nicely. I don’t see any fixed wall. I mean of course, every incremental 10 million is a little harder than the last 10 million, but our content keeps getting better, so those forces offset each other. When you look at the last five years, everyone is worried every quarter about saturation in the U.S., and we’ve just continued to grow. But it doesn’t mean it’s going to be inherently forever. But we certainly feel good about the near-term as we’re expanding and just getting bigger content budget, more shows, more marketing and so all of that feels very good. Ted Sarandos And component of that obviously is the international appeal of our global regional shows. But also finding those sweet spot local regional shows that offer some connectivity with the consumers. And for some cases it will be the thing that introduces them to Netflix programming and they fall in love with the broader slate of content. David Wells And then finally, Doug, on your last one, I wouldn’t say anything different from Reed. I mean, if we can get, my God, if we can get penetration levels outside the U.S. to be anywhere close to the U.S., you’re implying multiple hundreds and millions of global subscribers with the U.S. beyond 50%. So I’m not sure I understand that point of the question other than to say that the concern as I hear it voiced is really that we wouldn’t be able to get to U.S. levels of penetration outside the U.S., so we’ve got some markets that are starting to get there. So I think we punch through that sort of concern and anxiety. Now we’re really at a phase where we’re starting to really benefit from the large pipeline that Ted is building and his team are building. And we’re really starting to have sometime in multiple markets that are somewhat new to us as Reed described in Asia. Reed Hastings A couple of years ago, Doug, there was a bunch of fear about the 30 million sub wall, with AOL had hit that and HBO would hit that. And the thing is everybody watches TV and nearly everybody has the Internet. So I don’t see anything that’s going to stop Netflix from getting to most people in the United States and then eventually hopefully most people around the world. But we’re not - we’re just going to focus on the everyday of making the services better and better. Doug Mitchelson The one follow-up to all that is, Ted, are you specifically targeting perhaps older demos you mentioned international with the product flow that you’re looking on? Ted Sarandos No, the key here Doug is, you’ve got this many people an incredible diversity of taste. So you have to have programming that really appeals to a broad demographic. So obviously a show like 13 Reasons why appeals much younger Grace and Frankie, which had a really successful third season launch obviously appeals to an older demographic. But the key is just people love television, people love to be entertained and the definition of what that thing is you’re in love with is different for each age, each country, and having a lot of that that increases our chances of having a deep connection with consumers. So that’s why in Q2, we’re launching a new season of a show, a new brand new set of comedy special, documentaries, kids’ shows every week coming up. And this is the idea the chance that you’re going to connect with somebody and it becomes their favorite show, or the reason they have Netflix it’s higher and higher if you’re able to do that. Doug Mitchelson Great. Thanks. Scott Devitt Sticking to the U.S. and speaking of genres and different types of content, you talk a little bit about Dave Chappelle. Why the sudden increase in standup comedy? What’s the price to value that you find that you’re getting out of that type of content? Ted Sarandos Well, there’s always been an interest in standup comedy. It was actually back in our early original content days and the red envelope entertainment, it’s all we did was produced original standup comedy and acquired documentaries and foreign language films, always had good luck with it just on a very small scale. And the format lends itself really well to what we’re doing and that it’s uncensored, it’s commercial free, and that it allows for a lot of creative freedom and the fan base for these folks is very big. So Dave Chappelle his return to standup comedy was a big event in the culture. And you could drew series level and movie level of viewing on some of these standup comedy specials if you pick them right and invest in them properly. So these were big ticket investments, but they’re also performing like big ticket content. So we’re thrilled with this so far. Scott Devitt And then family and kids content, Ted, you mentioned a little bit and talk more about that in terms of the interest in extending deeper there. And then on that topic as well faith-based programming, conservative programming, Hollywood does lean a little in one direction seems like there’s a pocket, or opportunity there to serve a very big market? Ted Sarandos Yes absolutely. We’re not - we’re trying to find the content that people love and that’s different for everyone, as I said earlier. So the faith-based market is something that we’re engaged on the edges, but we’re looking to do a lot more. And we’re also looking for like our kids and family programming, and the really exciting thing is when you get something that can be viewed by both. So that’s the kind of phenomenon around Stranger Things or Fuller House, where you have these co-viewing opportunities that are so rare on TV these days, where it’s a kids’ show that parents enjoy watching and that don’t get - don’t have to cringe when they watch with their kids. Scott Devitt And then finally on this topic, the Disney deal. How’s that progressing the interest in renewing that content specifically, or content like that? And what’s your interest in - I believe there’s a paramount deal that’s available in the next few years as well? Thanks. Ted Sarandos Like I’ve said before, our interest in Disney is different than our interest in a Pay 1 output deal from a studio, because Disney has really centered their brand on a couple of really important tempos that perform very well on Netflix and obviously perform well around the world. So it’s been a great relationship and continues to be a great relationship with Disney as a company producing our Marvel series as well as being their Pay 1 partner and hundred - several hundred hours of their catalog all the time. So it continues to be a great partnership and they’re great supplier of content that people love so we’ll see. Reed Hastings And while the Marvel series is global, the Disney Pay 1 is just U.S. and Canada, so it’s not a global deal. Scott Devitt Great. Thank you. Doug Mitchelson From my end for Reed over the past few months, it seems like we’ve had a number of important executives depart Netflix Chief Product Officer, Neil Hunt; Chief Talent Officer, Tawni Cranz; VP, Global Television, Sean Carey; seems like an unusual number of departures usually you’re the one taking other companies executives. Any comment you want to make around this dynamic? Reed Hastings It is unusual. I mean, the last time we had an officer leave Netflix was 2012. So it’s quite a while ago. We’ve got to search on the Chief Talent Officer insiders and outsiders. And then we’re fortunate to have Greg Peters take over for Neil Hunt. Greg has been a long-term Netflix veteran really knows the organization and excited about taking it forward and that transition will happen in about three months from now. Doug Mitchelson And so no particular signal that investors should take from this. It just happened to line up this way? Reed Hastings That’s correct. Doug Mitchelson Thank you. Ted, you mentioned last quarter that it would be a second-half weighted content slate this year. Can you give us more of a sense of why you feel this way obviously 2Q looks pretty big with both House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. Is the second-half going to be even bigger? Ted Sarandos Well, we’re introducing a lot of new brands in the second-half of the year, including some of our more aggressive moves into the movie business. Bright actually will be in the fourth quarter, which is our big Will Smith film that we think will kind of give consumers and everyone who watches this space a better idea of the kind of things we’re up to in the movie space, which is those movies that you would see in the theaters. But they’re available to you day in day out on Netflix and that they look and feel like movies of that scale. Doug Mitchelson I’m sure you’d love to expand on this topic in detail for the press. Any thoughts on the writers’ strike? Ted Sarandos Look, we’re keeping an eye on it like everybody else and like everybody else our productions would be impacted if it happens. We may be impacted a little bit less, because we’re not on such a rigid production schedule, where we’re not producing for the fall in the summer, we’re in year round production. But some of our productions would be held up in the event of a strike, which our fingers are crossed that, that won’t happen. Doug Mitchelson And the last thing I did want to follow-up, because I think I’ll let you get away with not giving us an update on the usage trends. You guys willing to make any comment on whether usage is still growing and in the U.S. and overseas, and what level is that? Reed Hastings Correct. We said that viewing is strong, growing, healthy, but we haven’t given specific numbers. Doug Mitchelson Okay. I missed that nuance again. So, Ted, are you want to? Ted Sarandos I did tell you - we did tell you that our subscribers have spent about a 0.5 billion hours watching Adam Sandler movies since Ridiculous 6 launched. Doug Mitchelson And I assume that’s a good thing. And I think that Ted for you, is the originals as a percentage of spend and as a percentage of hours is fairly consistent. Is there an inconsistency there? Anything strategically that you’re focused on in that dynamic? Ted Sarandos No, pretty consistent into the investment and the hours of spent watching. That’s why we’ve said before that the investment in original programming has been efficient, that’s what we mean relative to what else you’d spend the money on versus the hours of viewing. So and there we’re not driving towards a target of a percent of original programming versus not. We’re just trying to find the great things for people to watch that move our business and grow the subscriber base. Scott Devitt Great. Thanks. And I’m going to try to help Doug get an answer on the viewing question. I think there was a disclosure in January 250 million hours of movie and TV in a single day in January, and the last prior disclosure to that was 125 million, which seemed to be like a run rate. And just wondering if that 250 million was an outlier, or if that is more of a run rate currently? Reed Hastings It’s really not the total aggregate viewing as opposed to the median viewing by country is not something internally that’s in our metrics pack. And so we don’t even track it that closely, it’s not that relevant. What we do track on a country by country basis is how median viewing at different lifetime slices is, and we continue to see good things in that, continue to see that grow as we have more content. David Wells And Scott, I’d add, just like Reed. These are milestones or convenient sort of PR milestones in terms of announcing it, and some of that growth is by launching new territories. And now, we’re more focused on growing each individual user within that territory than we are in terms of the big aggregate number, as Reed said. Reed Hastings If we can help you out, I remember that, YouTube announced there were 1 billion a day and when we looked it up and we’re a little over 1 billion a week. So we’ve got a long way to go to catch up to YouTube. Scott Devitt Thanks. And then downloading is also a fairly new phenomenon within Netflix, speak a little bit more about that, how it’s being adopted within accounts? Also, any changes from a technology architecture standpoint that have needed to be done to produce that? Reed Hastings It’s pretty small impact. I mean, you’re not on airplanes or cars that much of your life, so it’s really nice to have when you use it. But at least in Western and more well-off markets, where networks are strong and relatively inexpensive, it’s a modest feature. I think in Asia it’s a little bigger, because the networks you’re off of an inexpensive network a lot of the time. But again, as networks get more modern, I think, we’ll see that downloading the need for it will go down and down, because basically you want to be able to just click and watch. You don’t want to have to think in advance outside of a couple of narrow scenarios like an airplane. Scott Devitt And has the reencoding that was discussed at Mobile World Congress, is that now complete? Reed Hastings No, we’re still - there is no complete when you get to encoding, just keep getting better and better and better. And so we’re continuing on all of that work, so that you can get an incredible picture quality on a very modest data plan on a phone. Scott Devitt Thank you. Doug Mitchelson So I’m going to switch to competition and Amazon, specifically. Amazon’s gone after a David Russell drama series with Robert De Niro producing the next series for Matt, these are sort of big tickets, big prices, very talented producers, actors and directors. Reed, when you look at the competitive landscape, anything at all that that makes you nervous, or that you feel like you have to accommodate, Ted, the fight for talent in Hollywood, any issues with Amazon ramping its originals and David on the cost side, could this influence the cost of originals higher than you’d like? Reed Hastings Like at one level, Amazon is an amazing company and doing so many different things, it’s really incredible. And then you think of Jeff Bezos in addition to all of Amazon doing a Washington Post and Blue Origin Rocket. So, I will say, we do think about all of that and their tremendous track record. On the other hand, they’re doing great programming and they’ll continue to do that. But I’m not sure if it will really affect us very much, because the market is just so vast. Think about it when you watch a show from Netflix and you get addicted to it, you stay up late at night. You’re really - we’re competing with sleep on the margin. And so it’s a very large pool of time. And a way to see that numerically is that, we’re a competitor to HBOs and yet over 10 years we’ve grown to 50 million, and they’ve continued modestly growing, they haven’t trunk. And so if you think about it as we’re not really affecting them, the answer is, well, why? And that’s because we’re like two drops of water in the ocean of both time and spending for people. And so Amazon can do great work and it would be very hard for it to directly affect us. It’s just home entertainment is not a zero sum game. And again, HBO success, despite our tremendous success is a good way to illustrate that. Ted Sarandos I would just add there are 500 cable channels, nearly every one of them have a original programming being produced every day. So it’s great that there’s a - it’s an incredible opportunity for producers to have multiple buyers for their programming and a great opportunity for consumers to have a lot more opportunity to find new shows that they’re going to love. David Wells And to Ted’s points, I mean, there’s more than just Amazon competing for those shows. So even if the show were lowering cost, we would have more content. You wouldn’t necessarily would make the decision, I don’t think to reduce the content level. We’re already growing operating margin. We were able to grow us margin over the last four or five years and now we’re switching to growing global operating margin. So, we’re already delivering that and also growing the content. So I think, sure I’d love to have shows less expensive, but honestly we’re more competing with the quality of the show and trying to push and improve the cinematic quality of that show, which is driving - has more of an influence on the cost of that than the individual competition within the market. Doug Mitchelson Absolutely. And Ted, to follow-up with your aspect of this, how is your relationship with Hollywood versus a year ago? How would you describe it? Does this dynamic come into play where at some point there’ll be a backlash from Hollywood we always talk about? The media companies ultimately looking at Netflix as a competitor competing on online video platform versus them supplying you with content and making a lot of money off? But have you seen a change in that dynamic at with any of the studios? Ted Sarandos Well, this is probably the most dynamic time of change in the television - in the history of the television industry and how everybody navigates, it feels really important obviously. But we are on top of being a competitor for projects and a competitor for attention, where an enormous customer of all the studios who would license us their content, sell us their content, who produce content - original content for us. So I think, the content evolution of the relationship is finding a balance between being a great supplier and a competitor. And the networks and the studios have navigated those waters since the beginning of television. Doug Mitchelson They have, but Hollywood goes for fits and starts and cycles. And right now, we’ve got writers agitating for more money, the talents getting a greater share, you’ve got a lot of cable networks that aren’t licensing syndicated content like they used to. There’s definitely a lot of change taking place and a lot of folks on Hollywood trying to figure out how exactly to wrestle with. But I guess, to your point, as you said, things are fine right now. Ted Sarandos Yes, we’re 10 years in and those fits and starts have started on day one and continue today. Doug Mitchelson Well, Ted, I think you would also say that one of the fundamental changes is the globalization of TV. So I think that, that is playing through Hollywood, and I think it’s playing through each one of the talent sections of Hollywood in terms of trying to understand what the value of content that’s now applicable to a double the audience globally say? Reed Hastings Correct and who do you compete with today when in the U.S., with - incredible success with our Spanish language original Ingobernable and also with our Portuguese language original from Brazil 3%. So the pool of people who are competing for the attention of viewers and ultimately the attention of buyers, it’s never been bigger. Doug Mitchelson Great. Thanks. Scott Devitt Speaking of studios, it seems like your initiatives with Netflix studio produced original content seem to be quite unique relative to others, or some recent media attention, Ted, I think you were quoted as suggesting spending several billion dollars in terms of allowing talent to be home when they actually create content. Ted Sarandos Yes. Scott Devitt Could you speak a little bit more about that, how you think that differentiates yourselves relative to competitors? Ted Sarandos Yes, look, it’s - think about it as an extension of our talent-friendly commitments, but also in terms of our commitment to quality. And what we have found in our own business is that, if we create a great working environment for employee, they do the best work of their lives. And I think in the case of production, a lot of that comes off in the performance, which comes off in the screen. So where we want to invest in our talent the way we invest in our talent inside of Netflix and create the best shows on television. One way of doing that is not having people travel all around to chase a tax credit. And one - in that article that I had referred to this, it was suggesting that perhaps the state of California could be more effective in building - investing n infrastructure versus and setting individual productions, because if you give people a great place to work, they’re going to have - they’re going to come to - come work in your state. Scott Devitt And there’s also I believe some job postings at least Netflix studio and the cloud and, it’s been discussed also in terms of differentiating and infusing technology into the studio to create content in different ways. Can you expand on that a bit? Ted Sarandos It goes along the same lines, we’re just giving people tools, right? We’re giving the people the right - the best tools to work with. So when you’re producing for Netflix - the Netflix studio that you have the most state-of-the-art tools at your disposal to create content and not get stuck in old technology. So we’re trying to innovate on things that matter to consumers, but also things that matter to creators. Scott Devitt Does - and I don’t know that this is connected to studio or not. But does the current infrastructure that you have in place does allow you to do live and near-live productions? Ted Sarandos It would - we have to invest in technology to do it. It’s not - there’s nothing that would prevent it from happening. But it’s - our desire is to continue to double down on our consumer proposition of on demand. I think it is that kind of freedom that the consumer receives from Netflix of watching what they want whenever they want is part of the value proposition. And live is back to the kind of the old paradigm of appointment television. Scott Devitt Thank you. Doug Mitchelson Can we shift to sort of on that Amazon topic and the international topic combined. I guess, Ted, for you. Amazon is building out local content pretty aggressively, particularly India, Japan. India, there’s talk of them starting up a studio. And you’ve, I think for the last couple of years really espouse this Hollywood strategy of Hollywood content’s global in nature and that can drive subscriptions globally. But you also believe on the studio here in the United States to pursue that more aggressively, does it make sense for you to more aggressively build out local studios overseas? And what capacity does the company have to even do that at this point? Ted Sarandos Well, we’re definitely already building our production capabilities outside of the United States. Today - we’re today filming local shows in 13 different countries, including India, including Japan. So we’re doing it simultaneously. We think it’s going to be the combination of the big global interest in original programming, complemented with a growing number of local language original series in each country. So we’re operating all over the world. We’re producing all over the world, because that’s where our customers are. Reed Hastings And, Ted, maybe you could just talk a little as an example in those of Terrace House, Death Note and Secret Games to illustrate that. Ted Sarandos Well, the different - the various versions of it obviously would be something like producing - something that would be more on the quality level that you’re used to seeing from Hollywood in India, a new series that we’re producing coming up called Sacred Games. In Japan, we have a show called Terrace House, it’s incredibly popular more in the unscripted mode as more consistent with the things you see every day on television in Japan. And then a movie Death Note that we’re producing today is epic piece of Japanese manga and anime that we’re remaking and reimagining that storyline for the world with more of a Western spin. So those - the different takes on content from around the world opens up the world to a world of storytellers, and that’s what’s really exciting about doing it. David Wells Doug, I think it’s worth, sorry, Doug. I think it’s work noting too that from our perspective this isn’t a change. You’re - what you’re seeing is the fulfillment of pipeline that’s been building for two, two-and-a-half years. And the fact that we’re operating in more territories. So I think, Ted, you would say this, this has been plans and works for a while. This isn’t really a change from what we’ve been talking about. Ted Sarandos Absolutely. Yes, we’re deep in production in Spain, Italy, Germany for shows that we’ll launch this year and we’re going to continue to grow in that. Our Ingobernable was our second major series for Mexico, we’ll have four from Brazil. So we’re continuing to grow it out and grow up that capability domestically and internationally. Doug Mitchelson And do you think 20% local, 80% sort of Hollywood U.S. content is the ratio that still looks good to you today, or do you think that 20% is rising as the international markets? Ted Sarandos I’d say that’s the right picture, that’s the right picture globally, Doug, and not to say that some countries won’t be some variance of that. But I’m not seeing a reversal of it in any territory. Doug Mitchelson The second topic I want to discuss was mobile, and I think, Neil Hunt before he retired talked about that since you’ve launched the rest of the world mobile usage of Netflix has really soared, and that there’s a lot that you’re thinking about in terms of customizing content for mobile, or even operationally, any more details on mobile that any of the three of you are going to share? Reed Hastings Well, at first, Neil is still with us for the next couple of months. Second is, they’re very experimental, just trying to figure out aspect ratio. So if you think of there were movies originally were very widescreen. When they showed on televisions that were 4:3 Technology developed pan and scan to be able to make that picture look a little better on a 4:3 screen. And so we’re just experimenting with variations of that of trying to figure out how to zoom in to be able to basically have faces be larger. But it’s super experimental. It’s a neat idea about how to adapt to the future. Ted Sarandos What we do know too is that the next 100 million subscribers are going to be far more likely to be watching content on mobile than the first 100 million, whether or not they want to watch anything differently, we’re going to find out. Reed Hastings Let’s get one question more from each of you guys. Doug Mitchelson So why don’t I take the next one, because Scott and I agreed that he would get the last. I’ll say for fun, Reed, how much longer to get the next 100 million subscribers if it took 10 years to get the first 100? Reed Hastings Well, to more than 10 million how you count the streaming shorter than the first 10, for sure. Scott… Scott Devitt And then, Reed for you, if you were to like in your current global dominance in global streaming to any army in the history of the globe, what would that be today? Reed Hastings I got the invitation to go visit Albania. So I may - you may see some summer photographs from me with members of the Albanian army. But remember that that’s all in fun and that Jeff Bewkes has been a great partner for us. So we do get him and he deserves that. But he really has been a great partner, and we think they will continue to be under AT&T for that matter. Again that comes back to the non-zero sum nature of entertainment. And the more we can all do great content, the better many different providers, including HBO, including Netflix will prosper. So it’s up to us just to figure out how to provide the best entertainment possible. Thank you, everyone. Scott Devitt Thanks. David Wells Thank you. Ted Sarandos Thank you.

Actually, first question for you, David, and then one for Reed. David, could you just talk a little bit about the net add results in the quarter versus expectations, and any dynamics underline the second quarter guidance that you want investors to know about? David Wells Well, I think what’s written in the letter and what I’ll reiterate is that, we’re not spending too much time understanding any particular quarter. We were with under 100,000 in the U.S. under a couple of 100,000 in the international versus our expectation. We had a particularly back-weighted first quarter, which were - we don’t usually have, but that explains some of the sort of net adds guidance versus actuals as well, and we have a pretty strong guide for Q1. So I think looking at our Q4, which is one of our strongest quarters ever and a pretty strong Q2 guide, we sort of look across that like we put in the letter and say, we’re still on a great growth path, and our content is working. And we’re pleased with the international growth and we’ve got a lot of growth left in the U.S. as well. Doug Mitchelson I mean, is there anything you would highlight in the second quarter in terms of an easy comparison. Last year, you talked about price increase buzz in the press, having a negative impact on U.S. dynamics, the content slate, anything you highlight driving the result? David Wells Well, the obvious one to talk about in total, talk about in more detail is the content slate. We talked in our dissent - in the January letter about House of Cards pushing into the second quarter. We’ve got a particularly full slate in Q2, which relative to Q1 is a little heavier, and then that’s comping off of last year’s Q1, we had a pretty strong Q1 as well. So I think that sort of explains some of it on the margin. But I think the background trend is just a very strong adoption of Internet streaming. So again, if you look across 12 months trend, we still got a lot of great growth. We’re growing well on track in international. We’re continuing to growing in the U.S. And quarter-to-quarter, you’ll see some fluctuations and some of that is explained by the content slate. Doug Mitchelson And Reed, upfront I want to turn to you at a high-level. I think you mentioned in the letter about to cross the 100 million subscribers mark, you’re about a decade into this. And I think in the last quarter’s letter, you talked about the next 10 years being tumultuous. And I was hoping you’d talk a little bit about what you meant by using that word in particular, and what are the challenges and opportunities as you look out over the next decade and target that next 100 million subscribers? Reed Hastings Well, I’m - we’re super excited expecting to cross 100 million this weekend, that’s a big accomplishment. But it’s really just the beginning. When you look at YouTube having a billion active users and a billion hours every day. When you look at Facebook’s, multi-billion numbers. We see that the Internet is just a phenomenal opportunity, of course, we’re pay service, not ad supported. We’re not as deep in international as those companies. But we definitely see a big opportunity around the world to just continue to do what we’ve been doing, which is make fantastic content, get people really excited about that content, and then we’re just continuing to grow. Doug Mitchelson Great. Thanks. Scott Devitt And just continuing on the roll of content, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the way that content releases do impact seasonality of the business, and as well new releases of new shows, say a Dave Chappelle’s show relative to say Season 5 of the House of Cards and the different impacts on gross and net subs? Thanks. Ted Sarandos Scott, I would just say, we’ve said previously that subsequent seasons of shows that have a big audience that are very popular tend to have more impact on the business than introducing brand new IP. So that’s why in the second quarter you’re seeing new seasons of some of our most popular and most acclaimed shows like House of Cards, Orange is the new Black, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Bloodline, Master of None. And in the first quarter, it was pretty heavy on new IP, but we’re super pleased to have such a big breakout on 13 Reasons why we just came on the last day of the quarter as well as Santa Clarita Diet, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Iron Fist, first season shows, and then something like Dave Chappelle comes along and it’s in its own class in terms of excitement for consumers in viewing and excitement around Netflix and now we’re looking for David - a third special from David next year. Reed Hastings And since then you can think of that content is making a little trickier to do the quarterly forecasting. But for the first-half of this year, we’re about 8.25 million net adds, which is what we were last year. So again, it moves itself around levels out. So I wouldn’t get too focused on predicting each quarter by the content. We’re continuing to learn on that. But mostly, we’re just trying to do better and better shows that are more and more popular. Scott Devitt And then as it relates to the international business, you noted some markets that are doing extremely well outside the U.S. and other markets that are still progressing. Can you talk about particularly in some of the larger markets where you feel like you’re underpenetrated where the largest sources of friction are increasing the subscriber base in those markets? David Wells So I would say I’ll pitch it to Reed afterward. It’s not necessarily a source of friction. I mean, we were pretty careful about not talking about specifics by market for competitive reasons. But we have said that, we experience a wide variety of adoption curves in different markets. We’ve seen some markets come out of the gate really fast. We some - we’ve seen some that have grown slowly and that really caught up and seen a great acceleration. So I would say, each market is different. Each one seems to have a different word-of-mouth, adoption pattern. But increasingly what’s new for us is that, we’re more and more global. And the more that we can release these shows that have wide global appeal, we’re getting sort of the benefit of that wide global word-of-mouth and the network effect of that that great scale, I mean, growing to 100 million and beyond. Global subscribers is really going to benefit us in having these shows that travel across multiple markets. So I think, we’re not particularly focused on any one challenge in the larger markets, I think it’s about continuing to make payments available, continuing to improve the product, continuing to improve the continent in that market with our global originals being the largest part of that. And then Reed, I don’t know, if you want to tack on anything there. Reed Hastings Yes, Scott, as you might remember, first, couple of years in Brazil, we were struggling with number of the aspects in particular getting the right content, where our service was getting watched a lot. I think it’s pretty parallel to that and of course, not every market is the same as Brazil, we have to learn market by market. But it’s nothing that’s very concerning to us. It’s just a note that in three of the regions LATAM, Europe and North America, we’ve got the formula we’re executing down. And in Asia, Middle East and Africa, we still got a bunch of work to do, particularly around getting enough of the right content that people want to view that we get our viewing hours higher and higher. Scott Devitt And just a follow on to the international topic. There have been several markets where you’ve launched non-U.S. originals. And I was interested in terms of the difficulties or ease with which you’re having in finding talent in those markets? And then secondly, in those markets in which you’re launching originals, the benefit in terms of the halo effect of the other markets actually latching onto that continent and viewing it, that’s driving the subscribers in those markets as well? Ted Sarandos Well, I could tell you about, we launched this past quarter Ingobernable, which is a Spanish language original Starring Kate del Castillo, that had a huge impact on us throughout Latin America, but also outside of Latin America and throughout the Spanish speaking world. And our ability to get in learn the production infrastructure, learn the - get to know the talent, have the talent get to know us, that’s one of those things that gets a nice accelerator as Netflix becomes better and better known around the world that the top talent in those markets want their shows on Netflix. So nothing is easy, but that that is something that we’ve had a lot of good fortune with finding the great town and the great shows locally, and it has been having a lot of impact outside of the country of origin. Scott Devitt Thank you. Doug Mitchelson The international arena is a pretty rich topic, but I want to move back to the U.S. But first, Reed, you mentioned consumption. I think investors would love to have an update on consumption both in the U.S. and overseas. What is the hours per day on average? Is it still growing for both cohorts year-to-year? Anything you’re willing to share at this point in time? Reed Hastings Yes, viewing is very large and growing, but nowhere near as big as YouTube. So we definitely got YouTube envy and we’ve got a lot a room to go. And some of the new shows like Ted was talking about, our movie out of Korea [indiscernible] has great global potential. So, we’re finding great talent around the world and that’s what drives up the viewing. Doug Mitchelson So I also wanted to hit on the U.S. And so even though a lot of the growth comes from international When you think about the U.S., a lot of investors are worried about the maturity and whether that sends a signal that you could ultimately have some issues with penetrations overseas. And I think, Reed, it starts with you and the vision for 60 million, 90 million subs, is that still the vision? Ted is part of that. What you have to do to execute on getting those subscribers that lead us looking for? And for David, on that topic, is there anything you see in the trends? I know you want us to not to dig into gross adds and churn on a quarterly basis too much, but it’s sort of what we do. Is there anything that you’re seeing that suggests there’s a majority wall coming anytime soon for the U.S.?Thanks. Reed Hastings U.S. market is continuing to grow very nicely. I don’t see any fixed wall. I mean of course, every incremental 10 million is a little harder than the last 10 million, but our content keeps getting better, so those forces offset each other. When you look at the last five years, everyone is worried every quarter about saturation in the U.S., and we’ve just continued to grow. But it doesn’t mean it’s going to be inherently forever. But we certainly feel good about the near-term as we’re expanding and just getting bigger content budget, more shows, more marketing and so all of that feels very good. Ted Sarandos And component of that obviously is the international appeal of our global regional shows. But also finding those sweet spot local regional shows that offer some connectivity with the consumers. And for some cases it will be the thing that introduces them to Netflix programming and they fall in love with the broader slate of content. David Wells And then finally, Doug, on your last one, I wouldn’t say anything different from Reed. I mean, if we can get, my God, if we can get penetration levels outside the U.S. to be anywhere close to the U.S., you’re implying multiple hundreds and millions of global subscribers with the U.S. beyond 50%. So I’m not sure I understand that point of the question other than to say that the concern as I hear it voiced is really that we wouldn’t be able to get to U.S. levels of penetration outside the U.S., so we’ve got some markets that are starting to get there. So I think we punch through that sort of concern and anxiety. Now we’re really at a phase where we’re starting to really benefit from the large pipeline that Ted is building and his team are building. And we’re really starting to have sometime in multiple markets that are somewhat new to us as Reed described in Asia. Reed Hastings A couple of years ago, Doug, there was a bunch of fear about the 30 million sub wall, with AOL had hit that and HBO would hit that. And the thing is everybody watches TV and nearly everybody has the Internet. So I don’t see anything that’s going to stop Netflix from getting to most people in the United States and then eventually hopefully most people around the world. But we’re not - we’re just going to focus on the everyday of making the services better and better. Doug Mitchelson The one follow-up to all that is, Ted, are you specifically targeting perhaps older demos you mentioned international with the product flow that you’re looking on? Ted Sarandos No, the key here Doug is, you’ve got this many people an incredible diversity of taste. So you have to have programming that really appeals to a broad demographic. So obviously a show like 13 Reasons why appeals much younger Grace and Frankie, which had a really successful third season launch obviously appeals to an older demographic. But the key is just people love television, people love to be entertained and the definition of what that thing is you’re in love with is different for each age, each country, and having a lot of that that increases our chances of having a deep connection with consumers. So that’s why in Q2, we’re launching a new season of a show, a new brand new set of comedy special, documentaries, kids’ shows every week coming up. And this is the idea the chance that you’re going to connect with somebody and it becomes their favorite show, or the reason they have Netflix it’s higher and higher if you’re able to do that. Doug Mitchelson Great. Thanks. Scott Devitt Sticking to the U.S. and speaking of genres and different types of content, you talk a little bit about Dave Chappelle. Why the sudden increase in standup comedy? What’s the price to value that you find that you’re getting out of that type of content? Ted Sarandos Well, there’s always been an interest in standup comedy. It was actually back in our early original content days and the red envelope entertainment, it’s all we did was produced original standup comedy and acquired documentaries and foreign language films, always had good luck with it just on a very small scale. And the format lends itself really well to what we’re doing and that it’s uncensored, it’s commercial free, and that it allows for a lot of creative freedom and the fan base for these folks is very big. So Dave Chappelle his return to standup comedy was a big event in the culture. And you could drew series level and movie level of viewing on some of these standup comedy specials if you pick them right and invest in them properly. So these were big ticket investments, but they’re also performing like big ticket content. So we’re thrilled with this so far. Scott Devitt And then family and kids content, Ted, you mentioned a little bit and talk more about that in terms of the interest in extending deeper there. And then on that topic as well faith-based programming, conservative programming, Hollywood does lean a little in one direction seems like there’s a pocket, or opportunity there to serve a very big market? Ted Sarandos Yes absolutely. We’re not - we’re trying to find the content that people love and that’s different for everyone, as I said earlier. So the faith-based market is something that we’re engaged on the edges, but we’re looking to do a lot more. And we’re also looking for like our kids and family programming, and the really exciting thing is when you get something that can be viewed by both. So that’s the kind of phenomenon around Stranger Things or Fuller House, where you have these co-viewing opportunities that are so rare on TV these days, where it’s a kids’ show that parents enjoy watching and that don’t get - don’t have to cringe when they watch with their kids. Scott Devitt And then finally on this topic, the Disney deal. How’s that progressing the interest in renewing that content specifically, or content like that? And what’s your interest in - I believe there’s a paramount deal that’s available in the next few years as well? Thanks. Ted Sarandos Like I’ve said before, our interest in Disney is different than our interest in a Pay 1 output deal from a studio, because Disney has really centered their brand on a couple of really important tempos that perform very well on Netflix and obviously perform well around the world. So it’s been a great relationship and continues to be a great relationship with Disney as a company producing our Marvel series as well as being their Pay 1 partner and hundred - several hundred hours of their catalog all the time. So it continues to be a great partnership and they’re great supplier of content that people love so we’ll see. Reed Hastings And while the Marvel series is global, the Disney Pay 1 is just U.S. and Canada, so it’s not a global deal. Scott Devitt Great. Thank you. Doug Mitchelson From my end for Reed over the past few months, it seems like we’ve had a number of important executives depart Netflix Chief Product Officer, Neil Hunt; Chief Talent Officer, Tawni Cranz; VP, Global Television, Sean Carey; seems like an unusual number of departures usually you’re the one taking other companies executives. Any comment you want to make around this dynamic? Reed Hastings It is unusual. I mean, the last time we had an officer leave Netflix was 2012. So it’s quite a while ago. We’ve got to search on the Chief Talent Officer insiders and outsiders. And then we’re fortunate to have Greg Peters take over for Neil Hunt. Greg has been a long-term Netflix veteran really knows the organization and excited about taking it forward and that transition will happen in about three months from now. Doug Mitchelson And so no particular signal that investors should take from this. It just happened to line up this way? Reed Hastings That’s correct. Doug Mitchelson Thank you. Ted, you mentioned last quarter that it would be a second-half weighted content slate this year. Can you give us more of a sense of why you feel this way obviously 2Q looks pretty big with both House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. Is the second-half going to be even bigger? Ted Sarandos Well, we’re introducing a lot of new brands in the second-half of the year, including some of our more aggressive moves into the movie business. Bright actually will be in the fourth quarter, which is our big Will Smith film that we think will kind of give consumers and everyone who watches this space a better idea of the kind of things we’re up to in the movie space, which is those movies that you would see in the theaters. But they’re available to you day in day out on Netflix and that they look and feel like movies of that scale. Doug Mitchelson I’m sure you’d love to expand on this topic in detail for the press. Any thoughts on the writers’ strike? Ted Sarandos Look, we’re keeping an eye on it like everybody else and like everybody else our productions would be impacted if it happens. We may be impacted a little bit less, because we’re not on such a rigid production schedule, where we’re not producing for the fall in the summer, we’re in year round production. But some of our productions would be held up in the event of a strike, which our fingers are crossed that, that won’t happen. Doug Mitchelson And the last thing I did want to follow-up, because I think I’ll let you get away with not giving us an update on the usage trends. You guys willing to make any comment on whether usage is still growing and in the U.S. and overseas, and what level is that? Reed Hastings Correct. We said that viewing is strong, growing, healthy, but we haven’t given specific numbers. Doug Mitchelson Okay. I missed that nuance again. So, Ted, are you want to? Ted Sarandos I did tell you - we did tell you that our subscribers have spent about a 0.5 billion hours watching Adam Sandler movies since Ridiculous 6 launched. Doug Mitchelson And I assume that’s a good thing. And I think that Ted for you, is the originals as a percentage of spend and as a percentage of hours is fairly consistent. Is there an inconsistency there? Anything strategically that you’re focused on in that dynamic? Ted Sarandos No, pretty consistent into the investment and the hours of spent watching. That’s why we’ve said before that the investment in original programming has been efficient, that’s what we mean relative to what else you’d spend the money on versus the hours of viewing. So and there we’re not driving towards a target of a percent of original programming versus not. We’re just trying to find the great things for people to watch that move our business and grow the subscriber base. Scott Devitt Great. Thanks. And I’m going to try to help Doug get an answer on the viewing question. I think there was a disclosure in January 250 million hours of movie and TV in a single day in January, and the last prior disclosure to that was 125 million, which seemed to be like a run rate. And just wondering if that 250 million was an outlier, or if that is more of a run rate currently? Reed Hastings It’s really not the total aggregate viewing as opposed to the median viewing by country is not something internally that’s in our metrics pack. And so we don’t even track it that closely, it’s not that relevant. What we do track on a country by country basis is how median viewing at different lifetime slices is, and we continue to see good things in that, continue to see that grow as we have more content. David Wells And Scott, I’d add, just like Reed. These are milestones or convenient sort of PR milestones in terms of announcing it, and some of that growth is by launching new territories. And now, we’re more focused on growing each individual user within that territory than we are in terms of the big aggregate number, as Reed said. Reed Hastings If we can help you out, I remember that, YouTube announced there were 1 billion a day and when we looked it up and we’re a little over 1 billion a week. So we’ve got a long way to go to catch up to YouTube. Scott Devitt Thanks. And then downloading is also a fairly new phenomenon within Netflix, speak a little bit more about that, how it’s being adopted within accounts? Also, any changes from a technology architecture standpoint that have needed to be done to produce that? Reed Hastings It’s pretty small impact. I mean, you’re not on airplanes or cars that much of your life, so it’s really nice to have when you use it. But at least in Western and more well-off markets, where networks are strong and relatively inexpensive, it’s a modest feature. I think in Asia it’s a little bigger, because the networks you’re off of an inexpensive network a lot of the time. But again, as networks get more modern, I think, we’ll see that downloading the need for it will go down and down, because basically you want to be able to just click and watch. You don’t want to have to think in advance outside of a couple of narrow scenarios like an airplane. Scott Devitt And has the reencoding that was discussed at Mobile World Congress, is that now complete? Reed Hastings No, we’re still - there is no complete when you get to encoding, just keep getting better and better and better. And so we’re continuing on all of that work, so that you can get an incredible picture quality on a very modest data plan on a phone. Scott Devitt Thank you. Doug Mitchelson So I’m going to switch to competition and Amazon, specifically. Amazon’s gone after a David Russell drama series with Robert De Niro producing the next series for Matt, these are sort of big tickets, big prices, very talented producers, actors and directors. Reed, when you look at the competitive landscape, anything at all that that makes you nervous, or that you feel like you have to accommodate, Ted, the fight for talent in Hollywood, any issues with Amazon ramping its originals and David on the cost side, could this influence the cost of originals higher than you’d like? Reed Hastings Like at one level, Amazon is an amazing company and doing so many different things, it’s really incredible. And then you think of Jeff Bezos in addition to all of Amazon doing a Washington Post and Blue Origin Rocket. So, I will say, we do think about all of that and their tremendous track record. On the other hand, they’re doing great programming and they’ll continue to do that. But I’m not sure if it will really affect us very much, because the market is just so vast. Think about it when you watch a show from Netflix and you get addicted to it, you stay up late at night. You’re really - we’re competing with sleep on the margin. And so it’s a very large pool of time. And a way to see that numerically is that, we’re a competitor to HBOs and yet over 10 years we’ve grown to 50 million, and they’ve continued modestly growing, they haven’t trunk. And so if you think about it as we’re not really affecting them, the answer is, well, why? And that’s because we’re like two drops of water in the ocean of both time and spending for people. And so Amazon can do great work and it would be very hard for it to directly affect us. It’s just home entertainment is not a zero sum game. And again, HBO success, despite our tremendous success is a good way to illustrate that. Ted Sarandos I would just add there are 500 cable channels, nearly every one of them have a original programming being produced every day. So it’s great that there’s a - it’s an incredible opportunity for producers to have multiple buyers for their programming and a great opportunity for consumers to have a lot more opportunity to find new shows that they’re going to love. David Wells And to Ted’s points, I mean, there’s more than just Amazon competing for those shows. So even if the show were lowering cost, we would have more content. You wouldn’t necessarily would make the decision, I don’t think to reduce the content level. We’re already growing operating margin. We were able to grow us margin over the last four or five years and now we’re switching to growing global operating margin. So, we’re already delivering that and also growing the content. So I think, sure I’d love to have shows less expensive, but honestly we’re more competing with the quality of the show and trying to push and improve the cinematic quality of that show, which is driving - has more of an influence on the cost of that than the individual competition within the market. Doug Mitchelson Absolutely. And Ted, to follow-up with your aspect of this, how is your relationship with Hollywood versus a year ago? How would you describe it? Does this dynamic come into play where at some point there’ll be a backlash from Hollywood we always talk about? The media companies ultimately looking at Netflix as a competitor competing on online video platform versus them supplying you with content and making a lot of money off? But have you seen a change in that dynamic at with any of the studios? Ted Sarandos Well, this is probably the most dynamic time of change in the television - in the history of the television industry and how everybody navigates, it feels really important obviously. But we are on top of being a competitor for projects and a competitor for attention, where an enormous customer of all the studios who would license us their content, sell us their content, who produce content - original content for us. So I think, the content evolution of the relationship is finding a balance between being a great supplier and a competitor. And the networks and the studios have navigated those waters since the beginning of television. Doug Mitchelson They have, but Hollywood goes for fits and starts and cycles. And right now, we’ve got writers agitating for more money, the talents getting a greater share, you’ve got a lot of cable networks that aren’t licensing syndicated content like they used to. There’s definitely a lot of change taking place and a lot of folks on Hollywood trying to figure out how exactly to wrestle with. But I guess, to your point, as you said, things are fine right now. Ted Sarandos Yes, we’re 10 years in and those fits and starts have started on day one and continue today. Doug Mitchelson Well, Ted, I think you would also say that one of the fundamental changes is the globalization of TV. So I think that, that is playing through Hollywood, and I think it’s playing through each one of the talent sections of Hollywood in terms of trying to understand what the value of content that’s now applicable to a double the audience globally say? Reed Hastings Correct and who do you compete with today when in the U.S., with - incredible success with our Spanish language original Ingobernable and also with our Portuguese language original from Brazil 3%. So the pool of people who are competing for the attention of viewers and ultimately the attention of buyers, it’s never been bigger. Doug Mitchelson Great. Thanks. Scott Devitt Speaking of studios, it seems like your initiatives with Netflix studio produced original content seem to be quite unique relative to others, or some recent media attention, Ted, I think you were quoted as suggesting spending several billion dollars in terms of allowing talent to be home when they actually create content. Ted Sarandos Yes. Scott Devitt Could you speak a little bit more about that, how you think that differentiates yourselves relative to competitors? Ted Sarandos Yes, look, it’s - think about it as an extension of our talent-friendly commitments, but also in terms of our commitment to quality. And what we have found in our own business is that, if we create a great working environment for employee, they do the best work of their lives. And I think in the case of production, a lot of that comes off in the performance, which comes off in the screen. So where we want to invest in our talent the way we invest in our talent inside of Netflix and create the best shows on television. One way of doing that is not having people travel all around to chase a tax credit. And one - in that article that I had referred to this, it was suggesting that perhaps the state of California could be more effective in building - investing n infrastructure versus and setting individual productions, because if you give people a great place to work, they’re going to have - they’re going to come to - come work in your state. Scott Devitt And there’s also I believe some job postings at least Netflix studio and the cloud and, it’s been discussed also in terms of differentiating and infusing technology into the studio to create content in different ways. Can you expand on that a bit? Ted Sarandos It goes along the same lines, we’re just giving people tools, right? We’re giving the people the right - the best tools to work with. So when you’re producing for Netflix - the Netflix studio that you have the most state-of-the-art tools at your disposal to create content and not get stuck in old technology. So we’re trying to innovate on things that matter to consumers, but also things that matter to creators. Scott Devitt Does - and I don’t know that this is connected to studio or not. But does the current infrastructure that you have in place does allow you to do live and near-live productions? Ted Sarandos It would - we have to invest in technology to do it. It’s not - there’s nothing that would prevent it from happening. But it’s - our desire is to continue to double down on our consumer proposition of on demand. I think it is that kind of freedom that the consumer receives from Netflix of watching what they want whenever they want is part of the value proposition. And live is back to the kind of the old paradigm of appointment television. Scott Devitt Thank you. Doug Mitchelson Can we shift to sort of on that Amazon topic and the international topic combined. I guess, Ted, for you. Amazon is building out local content pretty aggressively, particularly India, Japan. India, there’s talk of them starting up a studio. And you’ve, I think for the last couple of years really espouse this Hollywood strategy of Hollywood content’s global in nature and that can drive subscriptions globally. But you also believe on the studio here in the United States to pursue that more aggressively, does it make sense for you to more aggressively build out local studios overseas? And what capacity does the company have to even do that at this point? Ted Sarandos Well, we’re definitely already building our production capabilities outside of the United States. Today - we’re today filming local shows in 13 different countries, including India, including Japan. So we’re doing it simultaneously. We think it’s going to be the combination of the big global interest in original programming, complemented with a growing number of local language original series in each country. So we’re operating all over the world. We’re producing all over the world, because that’s where our customers are. Reed Hastings And, Ted, maybe you could just talk a little as an example in those of Terrace House, Death Note and Secret Games to illustrate that. Ted Sarandos Well, the different - the various versions of it obviously would be something like producing - something that would be more on the quality level that you’re used to seeing from Hollywood in India, a new series that we’re producing coming up called Sacred Games. In Japan, we have a show called Terrace House, it’s incredibly popular more in the unscripted mode as more consistent with the things you see every day on television in Japan. And then a movie Death Note that we’re producing today is epic piece of Japanese manga and anime that we’re remaking and reimagining that storyline for the world with more of a Western spin. So those - the different takes on content from around the world opens up the world to a world of storytellers, and that’s what’s really exciting about doing it. David Wells Doug, I think it’s worth, sorry, Doug. I think it’s work noting too that from our perspective this isn’t a change. You’re - what you’re seeing is the fulfillment of pipeline that’s been building for two, two-and-a-half years. And the fact that we’re operating in more territories. So I think, Ted, you would say this, this has been plans and works for a while. This isn’t really a change from what we’ve been talking about. Ted Sarandos Absolutely. Yes, we’re deep in production in Spain, Italy, Germany for shows that we’ll launch this year and we’re going to continue to grow in that. Our Ingobernable was our second major series for Mexico, we’ll have four from Brazil. So we’re continuing to grow it out and grow up that capability domestically and internationally. Doug Mitchelson And do you think 20% local, 80% sort of Hollywood U.S. content is the ratio that still looks good to you today, or do you think that 20% is rising as the international markets? Ted Sarandos I’d say that’s the right picture, that’s the right picture globally, Doug, and not to say that some countries won’t be some variance of that. But I’m not seeing a reversal of it in any territory. Doug Mitchelson The second topic I want to discuss was mobile, and I think, Neil Hunt before he retired talked about that since you’ve launched the rest of the world mobile usage of Netflix has really soared, and that there’s a lot that you’re thinking about in terms of customizing content for mobile, or even operationally, any more details on mobile that any of the three of you are going to share? Reed Hastings Well, at first, Neil is still with us for the next couple of months. Second is, they’re very experimental, just trying to figure out aspect ratio. So if you think of there were movies originally were very widescreen. When they showed on televisions that were 4:3 Technology developed pan and scan to be able to make that picture look a little better on a 4:3 screen. And so we’re just experimenting with variations of that of trying to figure out how to zoom in to be able to basically have faces be larger. But it’s super experimental. It’s a neat idea about how to adapt to the future. Ted Sarandos What we do know too is that the next 100 million subscribers are going to be far more likely to be watching content on mobile than the first 100 million, whether or not they want to watch anything differently, we’re going to find out. Reed Hastings Let’s get one question more from each of you guys. Doug Mitchelson So why don’t I take the next one, because Scott and I agreed that he would get the last. I’ll say for fun, Reed, how much longer to get the next 100 million subscribers if it took 10 years to get the first 100? Reed Hastings Well, to more than 10 million how you count the streaming shorter than the first 10, for sure. Scott… Scott Devitt And then, Reed for you, if you were to like in your current global dominance in global streaming to any army in the history of the globe, what would that be today? Reed Hastings I got the invitation to go visit Albania. So I may - you may see some summer photographs from me with members of the Albanian army. But remember that that’s all in fun and that Jeff Bewkes has been a great partner for us. So we do get him and he deserves that. But he really has been a great partner, and we think they will continue to be under AT&T for that matter. Again that comes back to the non-zero sum nature of entertainment. And the more we can all do great content, the better many different providers, including HBO, including Netflix will prosper. So it’s up to us just to figure out how to provide the best entertainment possible. Thank you, everyone. Scott Devitt Thanks. David Wells Thank you. Ted Sarandos Thank you.

Steve Shindler Thank you, Tahmin. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. As you know, following a disappointing year in 2013 our goal is to generate better operational and financial results for 2014. We are working to deliver on that goal and we are starting to see progress in some key areas, including positive trends in our 3G subscriber growth in Brazil. Our results for the first quarter also reflect the impact of problems in other areas of the business, including continuing difficulty and attracting and retaining customers in Mexico, and the negative impact on our revenues of iDEN customers in Brazil switching to lower rate plans on our iDEN network. We are taking actions that we believe will address these challenges but it will take time for those actions to drive meaningful improvements in our results. We believe that the launch of our 3G networks in Brazil and Mexico have positioned us to compete more effectively. In Brazil, we have seen how our new 3G capabilities are making a difference. During the first quarter we saw significant improvement in customer loading on our 3G network, but we have also learned from our network deployment in Mexico that launching 3G services alone is not the answer if the overall user experience doesn’t meet our customers’ expectation. As a result, we are faced with rebuilding customers’ confidence in our services in Mexico and convincing them that the Nextel brand continues to stand for quality service and a superior customer experience. So our priorities for this year are straight forward. We must stabilize our operations in Mexico, invest widely in growth in Brazil and consistently execute across our operations. We continue to believe the best way to create long-term value for our business is to invest in initiatives to generate subscriber growth. However, given our need to preserve liquidity, we will strive to strike the right balance between driving growth and managing our use of cash. Finally, as we announced on our last results call, we are continuing to evaluate strategic alternatives and other actions we can take to address our liquidity challenges that we discussed in our 10-K and in the 10-Q we filed this morning. We have not yet arrived in any decision and we will update you when it is appropriate to do so. Now, I will turn the call over to Gokul Hemmady, our Chief Operating Officer. Gokul Hemmady Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, we are making some progress in certain areas of our business, but still have some challenges to overcome. We are continuing to make investments to support our growth strategy and we are starting to see some of the benefits of those investments as consolidated gross adds increased 6% from last quarter. However, even with the better subscriber growth on our 3G networks, we are continuing to have difficulty retaining iDEN customer, evidenced by our year-over-year increase in consolidated churn to 3.42%. We have not been able to stop the deterioration of our revenues, which has been impacted by declining customer base as we generated net subscriber losses of 52,000 for the quarter. Consolidated ARPU decline 8% from last quarter due to lower local currency exchange rates and the continuing decline in lower local currency ARPU in Brazil as our iDEN customers who remained on iDEN moved to lower price rate plan. The resulting smaller revenue base coupled with the investments we are making to grow the business continue to pressure consolidated adjusted OIBDA, which declined $28 million compared to the fourth quarter. We are taking steps to stabilize our local currency ARPU, return to growth in Mexico and reverse the declining OIBDA trend, which I will discuss in greater detail later, but overall we are starting to feel about where the business is heading. We believe that Brazil return to subscriber growth, shows that our business model can work and that we can replicate that trend in Mexico, making us more confident that we can take advantage of the significant opportunity there. Now I would like to give you a brief update on the operations in our core markets starting with Brazil. Nextel Brazil generated 171,000 net adds for the quarter, a four-fold increase compared to the first quarter of last year and more than doubled the net adds in the fourth quarter, driven by the strength of 3G gross adds, but partially offset by higher churn in our iDEN base. Overall, customer churn remained stable at 2.4%, which is comparable both year-over-year and sequentially. Demand for our 3G services drove 3G gross adds of 281,000 for the quarter, a sequential increase of 149,000. During the first quarter, Nextel Brazil use its 3G capabilities to drive subscriber growth, while delivering better performance on other key metrics like CPGA and churn. We are continuing to invest in initiatives designed to drive growth and transform the image of our company, so that customers understand that we are a nationwide 3G operator. We expect those initiatives including our marketing program, the launch of new distribution channel, the implementation of new back office systems and the deployment of LTE networks to drive subscriber growth during 2014. We also extended the reach of our 3G network in the State of Rio during the quarter and now provide 3G coverage to about 59 million POPs in Brazil. We are using advantages available to us under the Mobile Termination Rates Settlement rules in Brazil to offer attractive plans to grow and retain customers. We are combining these plans with our high-quality service and unexpanded device portfolio that includes 13 3G smartphones to change the perception of our brand and services, and drive customer growth. We are seeing some evidence of the success of this strategy. For example, 3G gross adds have increased each consecutive month from October 2013 to March 2014, resulting in two times the level of gross adds in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Our customers in Brazil are also recognizing the value of what we offer as we receive the number one net promoter score for business customers and the number two net promoter score for consumers in the markets we serve. We are also moving forward with the launch of LTE services in Rio during the summer as part of our effort to maintain the best customer experience in the market and to support our subscriber growth goals for this year and beyond. We are focused on 3G subscriber growth because we anticipate that an improved revenue and margin profile will come with that growth as we gain scale on our new networks. To-date, despite a much stronger 3G subscriber growth trajectory in Brazil, we have not yet been able to stop the erosion of our revenue base due to the continued pressure on ARPU. This pressure gas resulted from a substantial number of iDEN customers switching to lower price rate plans on that platform, a trend toward larger bucket plans that are resulting in lower overage fees and to a lesser extent the deactivation of higher ARPU customers. We have been continuing to see improvements in loading ARPU from new 3G customers and we are planning to increase prices on our iDEN rate plans to help stabilize ARPU. While we are pleased with the progress we have made in driving 3G gross adds in Brazil, our success in doing that has also resulted in some operational challenges in our business. We are working to improve our logistics and fulfillment processes to improve our ability to deliver handsets to customers at various points of presence. We’re also experiencing a spike in calls to our customer service center, which is pressuring our response times and operating costs. We are closely monitoring our operations to make sure we identify these types of issues early and resolve them quickly. Now turning to Mexico. Nextel Mexico’s operational results include net subscriber losses of 212,000 compared to 16,000 net adds during the first quarter of 2013, primarily as a result of a year-over-year increase in churn from 2.1% to 4.3%. We generated 172,000 3G gross adds in the first quarter which was comparable to what we reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. We continue to face issues around customer retention in Mexico with net subscriber losses during the first quarter similar to the fourth quarter after removing the impact of prepaid subscriber adjustment we recognized late last year. It’s critical that we addressed the factor underlying this problem and improved the performance of our sales organization to stabilize our operations in Mexico so that we are in a better position to return to subscriber growth in the second half of the year. Our market research in Mexico shows that our brand is still seen as aspirational but subscriber retention continues to be an issue because of the damage to our reputation that we experienced last year. In other words, we need to regain the confidence of our customers. We believe that our decision to rush our 3G network in the service and aggressively migrate customers to the new network in response to Sprint’s shut down of its iDEN network last year was a significant driver of this loss of confidence. To address this event, we have invested to improve our 3G network quality and customer experience, building over 2000 additional sell sites in 2013 and over 300 more this quarter. In addition, we launched an indoor coverage program to go along with the improvements we've made in our roaming and PTT capabilities last year. These investments have resulted in improvements in customer’s opinion of the quality of our service in Mexico with independent studies indicating that our network quality is number one or number two in most of the regions where we offer our service. As in Brazil, we are using our 3G network in Mexico to offer significant value to customers and improve our competitive position. For example, our recently launched 600 rate plan provide 6x the amount of data available under comparably priced offers by our competitors. During the first quarter, we also launched our iPhone in Mexico and we planned to launch LTE services in the number of cities in that market later this year. We are taking these actions to create a strong value proposition on our data platform, which we believe will differentiate our services and give customers another reason to choose us. We are also making changes designed to improve the productivity of our distribution channel, enhance the capabilities of our IT systems and increase the efficiency of our handset fulfillment process. For example, we are improving our ability to run credit checks at our retail stores and improving inventory distribution to ensure we have the right handsets at the right locations to better meet our customers’ needs and improve their experience with us. Looking more broadly at the situation in Mexico, I think we have addressed the number of the problems that created negative perception of our services last year. But it will take some time to regain the confidence of our customers and position our Mexican business to return to subscriber growth. So as I look at our operations across our markets, I see progress in a number of important areas but there is still much work to do. We must drive better execution across a number of initiatives including stabilizing our operations in Mexico, halting the declining ARPU trend in Brazil and reversing the trend of declining consolidated revenue and adjusted OIBDA. We must also make investments in LTE, find and capture CapEx efficiencies and take advantage of the improving regulatory landscape in Mexico. We must execute on all these fronts if we are to be successful.  Now I'll turn the call over to Juan Figuereo, our Chief Financial Officer to discuss our results. Juan Figuereo Thank you, Gokul. I’ll start by providing an overview of our financial results for the period. Then I would like to give you an update on our current liquidity position including a review of our unusually high cash burn during the quarter. Finally, I will share additional details on our capital investment program for 2014. Now to the consolidated numbers for the first quarter. We generated consolidated operating revenues of $970 million, down 27% from $1.3 billion in the first quarter of last year due to the combined effect of weaker local currency ARPU and a smaller average subscriber base. ARPU was $29, down $10 from the first quarter of 2013 driven by lower ARPU levels in Brazil and Mexico and weaker foreign currency exchange rates. Our consolidated adjusted OIBDA loss of $84 million compared to positive adjusted OIBDA of $228 million in the first quarter of 2013, reflects the combined impact of lower revenues, higher operating costs associated with our 3G network and increased customer acquisition and migration costs associated with growing our 3G customer base. Excluding the impact of lower local market exchange rates, our operating revenues for the quarter would have been 60% lower than the first quarter of 2013 and adjusted OIBDA would have been higher by $68 million. We remain on track to capture estimated annual savings in excess of $59 million associated with Project Accelerate. We have reduced the combined headcount in Mexico, Brazil and headquarters by approximately 12% since we started our headcount reduction initiatives in 2012. We invested $118 million in total capital expenditures during the period, with Nextel Mexico and Nextel Brazil accounting for almost all of the investment. We spent over 90% of our total capital expenditures on our 3G deployment efforts. Turning to our markets. During the quarter, Nextel Brazil delivered improving 3G subscriber growth but revenues continue to decline as a result of declining ARPU and weaker foreign currency exchange rates. We generated operating revenues of $461 million in Brazil, down 27% from $636 million in the first quarter of 2013 due to lower ARPU which offset the impact of a larger average subscriber base. ARPU of $31 was down $16 year-over-year due to the combined impact of iDEN customers switching to lower rate plan and weaker foreign currency exchange rates. However demand for our 3G services is growing and we expect that the 3G customers will generate a better ARPU profile. Segment losses were $29 million compared to $158 million in segment earnings in the first quarter of 2013, resulting from the combined impact of lower revenues, incremental 3G investments and operating expenses and the impact of higher gross adds on customer acquisition costs. Excluding the impact of lower local market exchange rates, our operating revenues in Brazil would have been 14% lower than the first quarter of 2013 and segment earnings would have been higher by $34 million. CapEx spend was $68 million and includes the launch of coverage of an additional 2 million POPs in real estate and relatively small investments related to our planned launch of LTE services later this year. Turning to Mexico, Nextel Mexico's quarterly performance reflects the challenges that we continue to face in that market. As Gokul mentioned, we have taken a number of steps to improve our competitors, but we expect that Nextel Mexico will continue to report subscriber losses through the first half of the year with the goal of returning to subscriber growth later in the year. Our first quarter operating revenues of $382 million in Mexico were down 26% from $514 million in the first quarter last year, as a result of a smaller average subscriber base and the reduction in ARPU. ARPU was $35, down $3 from the first quarter of 2013 due to the combined impact of lower local currency ARPU and weaker local currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of lower local market exchange rate, our operating revenues would have been lower by 22% compared to the first quarter of 2013. Segment losses for the quarter were $13 million, down from $101 million in segment earnings in the first quarter of 2013. Resulting from the combined impact of lower revenues, incremental 3G investments and higher migration costs as customers transitioned from iDEN to 3G services. While CPGA improved during the quarter compared to the fourth quarter 2013, it is still short of our expectations. We are focused on lowering customer acquisition costs with a higher mix of gross adds being generated through our lower-cost retail channels as well as increased focus on lower-cost customer segments. CapEx spend was $39 million, down from $52 million in the first quarter of 2013. Now briefly turning to our other markets, Nextel Argentina had subscriber losses for the first time in many years, reporting a net subscriber loss of $26,000 for the period, mainly due to higher prepaid churn related to deteriorating economic conditions. Additionally, segment earnings dropped to $27 million from $52 million in the prior year period, primarily due to weakening local currency exchange rates and changes in the regulatory environment, including a change in billing rules from third minute to per second. Despite limited investments through the period, Nextel Chile continued to grow its customer base. In Chile, we added 15,000 net subscribers, while using less cash. Segment losses minus CapEx decreased by about 33% compared to the first quarter of 2013. Turning to our balance sheet, at quarter end, we had $1.7 billion in cash and investments Total debt including the current portion was $5.9 billion, resulting in net debt of $4.2 billion, an increase of $789 million compared to the year end 2013, reflecting a significant use of cash during the quarter, as well as non-cash borrowings under our equipment financing facility in Mexico. There were a number of factors that contributed to the higher than normal use of cash. The primary use of cash during the quarter was for working capital of $320 million, driven by few significant items. We paid about $135 million in annual spectrum fees in Mexico, which have been paid historically during the second quarter. We increased handset inventories by approximately $68 million, as we expanded the portfolio in Brazil and prepared for the iPhone launch in Mexico. And we paid $53 million more in net VAT taxes in Brazil due to CapEx and handset purchases. In addition, we paid $182 million in cash for capital expenditures and $162 million in interest. Lastly, as you know, our adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was a negative $84 million, driven by customer acquisition costs, 3G network costs and other factors described earlier. Based on our current sources of liquidity, we believe we have enough cash to last through this year and continue into early 2015. As Steve mentioned, we are continuing to evaluate incremental actions we can take to address our liquidity challenges. We continue to believe that investing to support subscriber and revenue growth is the best path to value creation for this business. And I would like to provide some insights into how we plan to invest the $607 million to $700 million in CapEx spend we projected for this year. Of our network related investments, we plan to spend 10% on iDEN and 80% on our 3sG networks, which represents an estimated 1,400 new 3G sites to improve quality, add capacity and increased indoor coverage. We plan to spend the remaining 10% of our network CapEx to deploy LTE in both Mexico and Brazil later this year. We also expect to spend the portion of our CapEx on non-network based assets to increase our retail presence, improve productivity and lower customer acquisition costs. As you know, we're still looking at strategic options, including opportunities relating sto our operations in Chile and Argentina. And while efforts are ongoing, we don’t have anything to report at this time. Also, during the quarter, we announced that we’ve hired strategic advisors to help us evaluate the best path forward to address our liquidity challenges. We continued to work on parallel paths with UBS and Rothschild to look at strategic and capital structure options. Finally, I would like to note that we are in active discussions with the lenders of our local loans in Brazil and supplier financing facilities in Brazil and Mexico to address the covenant issues we noted last quarter. We will update you when we have further information to report. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Steve. Steve Shindler Thank you, Juan. During the quarter, Nextel Brazil continued the trend of increasing gross adds on our 3G network, making further progress in our transformation to a 3G data company in the eyes of the marketplace. Nextel Mexico took many important steps towards stabilizing operations and improving the perception of our service offering. The next important phase for us in Brazil is to turn subscriber momentum into revenue growth. And the next critical phase for us in Mexico is to see the operational and process improvements take hold to bring us back to positive net adds. Really, our cash investments during the first quarter were significant. But necessary to get us back on a sustainable growth path. Going forward, we will balance our use of cash as we continue to step towards completing our operational turnaround, while finding a broader solution to our liquidity and capital structure challenges. We appreciate your support and interest in our company and we will keep working to improve our results. Tahmin Clarke Operator, before we take questions, I want to confirm that we will not be able to respond to questions on the strategic and balancing alternatives that we are evaluating. We will update you on the developments in those areas when it’s appropriate to do so. But we will not provide additional information on these topics today. Operator, we are now ready to take our first question. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James Thanks. Good morning. Steve Shindler Good morning. Juan Figuereo Good morning. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James Couple of questions. One, on the active discussions with the corporate financing in Brazilian banks, can you talk us through just structurally, how does it work? You have a June 30th measurement date, when do they actually do the measurement, when would you need the covenant relief, just try and help us understand the timeline of what's involved? Juan Figuereo Yes. Sure, Ric. This is Juan. The measurement date as you -- the next measurement date as we pointed out is in June and we have to report in 60-days after the measurement date, so we will be looking at 60 days after June 30. And so, typically, the way that would work is, we would wait until then, we report, and then we have to review the conversation. In this case, because we expect that we will not be in compliance at the next measurement date, we started the discussions with the banks fairly early, almost as soon as we informed you on the previous call. And I would tell you that at least with regards to the Brazilian banks, we’ve had preliminary conversations. The story of Brazil, if you think about it, if you’re creditor in the local market, it’s not about story, it’s you’re looking for more room in your covenants because your business is growing and the growth in our industry is expensive. So we fully expect that the banks will work with us, but of course we will know that only when we are done in conversations with them. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James Okay. And second question is, the tower sale, I think you still have about ballpark $90 million worth of outstanding towers that haven’t sold to [Market] (ph). What are you thoughts as far as -- will there be the full sale, what kind of timeframe because every $90 million, $100 million counts? Juan Figuereo Yes, you are right, Rick. We still -- we closed, I should say, 3400 towers and we received proceeds of $720 million. So there is about $80 million to $90 million more to go based on our original estimate. We are working on the paperwork to complete and close those towers, and we expect to do it later this year. We will announce it when it happens. It’s just that the tail of any transaction is usually the ones that are more difficult to get you documentation ready. Incidentally, I don’t remember if we mention previously, but the tax leakage and the ones that we did close was only about 5% of the purchase price. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James Okay. And then my question is, on the LTE aspects, you mentioned launching in Rio in the summertime and then in Mexico I think later ’14. Are the handsets that you’re selling capable of using LTE, or do you need to have a whole another set of handsets deployed out there? And remind us again, you said iPhone in Mexico was in 1Q, where does it stand in Brazil? Steve Shindler Yes, so, Rick, this is Steve. We are deploying the LTE networks in select cities in Mexico and Rio, as you heard, from Gokul, and all of the handsets that we would deploy on that network are compatible. We would use the existing spectrum we have in Mexico on the AWS band and the 1.8 in Brazil. All of those bands are compatible with what’s already offered in the marketplace. So there will be an abundance of possible sales of SIM cards. We have that available to us in Brazil today on the 3G side but not in Mexico. So that will be a nice change for us once we get the LTE deployed. Gokul Hemmady And, Rick, we did launch iPhone in Brazil in late January, and we are seeing good traction not only with the sales of the iPhone but also the overall perception of rather 3G operations. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James So not expecting too much more handset inventory ramp up then as we look into 2Q given what we saw in 1Q? Steve Shindler I would say that is fair -- that’s fair. I think we did take position in Brazil as well as somewhat in Mexico, but certainly in Brazil where we front-loaded some of our purchase of handsets, not just the iPhone but across the board, and I would expect that that certainly is much lower as we along here. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question is from the line of Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead, sir. Walter Piecyk - BTIG Thanks. Just want to follow up on the first question about the preliminary discussions. I think you used the similar kind of language three months ago on the preliminary discussion. So given that’s kind of coming up on June 30 pretty quickly here. I wonder if you could give a little bit more details about when we should expect something to happen there. And if nothing does happen, does that force you then to make a decision on whether you’re making the interest payments on June 30. And then just again this is all one question but finally on the June 30 payment, is it like a 30-day grace period before you are in default on making those payments? Thanks. Juan Figuereo So let me see how I would take that. First, the early discussions with the local banks were different from the discussions we’re having today. The initial discussions were kind of to inform and give them a hint that we could be having some challenges when it came -- the measurement date came around. The more recent discussions are about we’re not going to make it come the measurement date, but here is the story, here is the business plan. And so based upon what they have seen in the business plan, I think it would be fair to say that the banks want to work us, they want to take their time to review the business plan. And they also, I think as would be expected, want to see how we’re going to address our overall liquidity issues, because addressing just one market doesn’t solve the bigger problem right since we fund from the parent company the markets. But generally, I would say we have been very open with the banks. We have shown them our business plan and the reception has been positive. So we fully expect that we should have some kind of understanding, and I don’t want to use agreements because I don't know if we will have something signed, but we will have some kind of understanding with the banks way before the measurement date. Walter Piecyk - BTIG And the measurement date is June 30? Juan Figuereo It is June 30, yes. Walter Piecyk - BTIG Sorry to be particular about this, but it’s May 12, so this is kind of we are at way before June 30. Juan Figuereo Yes. So I know you understand right when you’re having conversations with the banks, it’s up to them, not up to you. So I can tell you that the conversations are ongoing. This is a process. They are receptive again because it’s a good story. If you are bank sitting in Brazil, it’s a story of growth, I see the business picking up momentum. We heard from Gokul that we are having number one, number two position in the markets from a Net Promoter Score, leading share of net adds in our markets for several months in a row now. So the banks like what they are hearing and they are working with us, but they will take their time. Walter Piecyk - BTIG And then just procedurally on your senior debt payments that are due, can you just walk us through what the obligations are and what leeway you have in and isn’t there like a 30-day period as far as making those exact payments? I am just trying to understand what the facts are and when you have to make payments and what timeline that gives you on evaluating your strategic possibilities, I guess, if they are any? Thanks. Juan Figuereo Yes. So first on the 30-day grace period, it is correct, there is a grace period. The next significant payment is in August, it’s August 15. And like our approach with the banks, we would like to have a definitive answer on which path we are going to take on the options in front of us before we have to face that big payment in August. Walter Piecyk - BTIG Can you comment today whether you are actually going to be making those June 30 payments, or are you just not commenting on that at this point? Juan Figuereo We are not commenting on that at this point. Walter Piecyk - BTIG Got it. Thank you. Operator Our next question is from the line of Ron Consiglio with UBS. Please go ahead. Ron Consiglio - UBS Could you give us some update on what you’re seeing in Brazil and Mexico through April? Juan Figuereo So I think I will -- we’ve had a very good first quarter in Brazil as part of Project Accelerate that we’ve talked about in the past. We’ve said that we’re introducing some great plans which offer great value to our consumers. We’ve been investing in distribution channels in media in range of devices. And all that, as you can see, has paid off in the first quarter. But in Brazil, sequentially, we’ve increased gross adds 30% and got significant traction on 3G, which is now about 60% of our overall loading, which we expect to increase as we move along here. Now without giving you any exact numbers on April, I would say that that traction is continuing. But having said that, as part of Project Accelerate, I would also say that the kinds of plans that we started offering are kind of entry level plans and that over time we expect to make fine-tuning changes to kind of change the price value equation, so that we start increasing margins on those plans. So that is an ongoing process that we’ll continue. So I think we’re seeing good traction as we go into April. Now with reference to Mexico, you’ve heard us say that we’ve introduced a similar kind of thought process with the 600 peso rate plan, which offers great value in the marketplace. Initial traction is very good in that plan. We feel very good about it. But again, the philosophy is similar. This is, as part of Accelerate, an entry level plan, which we will start making changes to as we move along and start increasing the margins. Ron Consiglio - UBS So when would you expect to get back to positive net adds in Mexico? And in Brazil, I guess, more specifically, you mentioned that you had increasing net adds from October forward. Would we see a continued growth in net adds in the subsequent months? Gokul Hemmady I think that a some amount of seasonality that’s going to happen with the world cup coming up in June here and then into July. But absent that, I would say that number one, the focus has been on subscriber growth. And as we move along here, as you heard both me, Steve, and Juan, say, the focus is now on really translating that subscriber growth into revenue growth and then profitability. And that is really the next area of focus for us in terms of making sure that the ARPU is expanded. We have much more stability in ARPU that we address things like stimulating usage, making sure that the migration from higher rate plans to lower rate plans are effectively addressed, and those kinds of things. So that’s really the focus while making sure that we have a good growth in subscribers. Ron Consiglio - UBS Okay. And then, can you give us some color… Steve Shindler This is Steve. I’m just going to add some color on the Mexico piece. As I mentioned in my closing remarks, we’ve done a lot to stabilize the processes and the operational components to get ourselves back into the growth mode and the next critical phase for us is to turn that into subscriber growth. We have the tools now in place that we didn’t have before the 3G network is complete. We’ve got the wider portfolio of devices, the nationwide coverage. The success that we’re seeing in Brazil gives us the confidence that we can do the same in Mexico. We’ve taken the steps to address the issues that led to a loss in customer confidence. The most important, which is a significant improvement in network performance, where we’re ranked number one or number two in all of the independent studies. So combined that with the focus of the efforts we have on sales channel optimization and improving productivity, we’ve done all the thing necessary to get us back into growth mode. Ron Consiglio - UBS Excellent. And then if you wouldn't mind, could you give us a sense for the types of customers that you are now attracting primarily with iDEN, it seems you are very focused on the business customer. Have you been able to hold onto those types of customers and how far down market have you gone? Gokul Hemmady So I think this is a very important question in Brazil. A lot of our loading is really -- all of our gross adds are postpaid, that’s number one. Number two, even within postpaid, I would say that we -- our concentration is much more on the higher end portion of the postpaid. So our 99 real plan is getting significant traction and therefore substantial portion of our gross add loading is 99 real plan.  I would say about 35%, 40% of our loading is businesses and the balance is consumers and pretty well balanced between Rio and Sao Paulo. And I would say it’s similar in Mexico, although some of the introduction of those plans are a little bit early. We have little more history in Brazil but early indications are that it’s similar in Mexico. Ron Consiglio - UBS That’s great. Thank you. Gokul Hemmady Thank you. Operator Our next question is from the line of Jacob Steinfeld with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead sir. Jacob Steinfeld - J.P. Morgan Hi, good morning. Steve Shindler Good morning. Jacob Steinfeld - J.P. Morgan I have a bit of a follow-up on the timing question in terms of your decision. So what’s the minimum amount of cash you feel you need to meet the needs at your foreign subsidiary level going forward? Juan Figuereo So we have said in the past and this is back, I think when we still own Peru that we would like to keep about $1 billion on the balance sheet. That was not an expression of the minimum cash required. It was what we thought we would like to have. If you look at strictly from a minimum cash standpoint, we have commitment both in Mexico and Brazil to keep about $100 million down in the local market in the operation. That’s not the minimum we need to operate the business but that’s the minimum that we need given the contractual commitments with lenders. Jacob Steinfeld - J.P. Morgan It is $100 million in each, Mexico and Brazil? Juan Figuereo Yes. Jacob Steinfeld - J.P. Morgan And then but on top of that, you have around $150 million in Argentina. So, I guess I'm just trying to understand pretty soon, you are running into a cash crunch and you mentioned you are looking at strategic options in Chile and Argentina. But in both of those countries to the extent you enter into a cell, I would presume you need regulatory approval and you will need to wait for that cash. So how are you thinking about the timing around those alternatives given the tight cash position? Juan Figuereo Okay. So let me tell you about the cash and Steve can talk a little bit about this strategic alternatives process. So the cash that we have in Argentina is essentially trapped cash. If we could move to cash freely out of Argentina, we would just keep the fraction of what is there now. But under the current environment in the country, we cannot repatriate the cash. We are unable to pay ourselves intercompany dividends and so our ability to move the cash is really limited. For all intents and purposes, we don’t have easy access to that cash. In Chile, we don’t keep any cash. We basically fund the business as required. And will let Steve comment on the process. Steve Shindler Yeah. So obviously, we understand certainly the pressure that we have on the liquidity product across the entire company. And in the markets that you pointed out, there is been discussions and then we’ve been in pursuit for quite sometime to find solutions to the liquidity issues, particularly related to the smaller markets of Argentina and Chile. There is nothing at this time that we have to report other than to confirm that. We continue to pursue aggressively in light of our understanding of the liquidity pressures that we face. Jacob Steinfeld - J.P. Morgan Okay. Great. Thank you. My last question was -- is the fact that you have negative equity now on the balance sheet a concern or does that have any implications? Juan Figuereo The concern is around the liquidity and I believe there are no triggers of anything on the negative equity. But of course, we are concerned about having enough liquidity, enough runway to complete the business plan, that's really is what striving our thinking right now. Jacob Steinfeld - J.P. Morgan Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Tahmin Clarke Operator, we’ve hit our 9:15 window. Operator Very good. Back to you, sir with your closing remarks. Steve Shindler Okay. Well, this is Steve and once again, we appreciate your interest and support of our company and thank you for joining us on the call this morning. Operator Thank you.

The story of Brazil, if you think about it, if you’re creditor in the local market, it’s not about story, it’s you’re looking for more room in your covenants because your business is growing and the growth in our industry is expensive. So we fully expect that the banks will work with us, but of course we will know that only when we are done in conversations with them. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James Okay. And second question is, the tower sale, I think you still have about ballpark $90 million worth of outstanding towers that haven’t sold to [Market] (ph). What are you thoughts as far as -- will there be the full sale, what kind of timeframe because every $90 million, $100 million counts? Juan Figuereo Yes, you are right, Rick. We still -- we closed, I should say, 3400 towers and we received proceeds of $720 million. So there is about $80 million to $90 million more to go based on our original estimate. We are working on the paperwork to complete and close those towers, and we expect to do it later this year. We will announce it when it happens. It’s just that the tail of any transaction is usually the ones that are more difficult to get you documentation ready. Incidentally, I don’t remember if we mention previously, but the tax leakage and the ones that we did close was only about 5% of the purchase price. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James Okay. And then my question is, on the LTE aspects, you mentioned launching in Rio in the summertime and then in Mexico I think later ’14. Are the handsets that you’re selling capable of using LTE, or do you need to have a whole another set of handsets deployed out there? And remind us again, you said iPhone in Mexico was in 1Q, where does it stand in Brazil? Steve Shindler Yes, so, Rick, this is Steve. We are deploying the LTE networks in select cities in Mexico and Rio, as you heard, from Gokul, and all of the handsets that we would deploy on that network are compatible. We would use the existing spectrum we have in Mexico on the AWS band and the 1.8 in Brazil. All of those bands are compatible with what’s already offered in the marketplace. So there will be an abundance of possible sales of SIM cards. We have that available to us in Brazil today on the 3G side but not in Mexico. So that will be a nice change for us once we get the LTE deployed. Gokul Hemmady And, Rick, we did launch iPhone in Brazil in late January, and we are seeing good traction not only with the sales of the iPhone but also the overall perception of rather 3G operations. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James So not expecting too much more handset inventory ramp up then as we look into 2Q given what we saw in 1Q? Steve Shindler I would say that is fair -- that’s fair. I think we did take position in Brazil as well as somewhat in Mexico, but certainly in Brazil where we front-loaded some of our purchase of handsets, not just the iPhone but across the board, and I would expect that that certainly is much lower as we along here. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question is from the line of Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead, sir. Walter Piecyk - BTIG Thanks. Just want to follow up on the first question about the preliminary discussions. I think you used the similar kind of language three months ago on the preliminary discussion. So given that’s kind of coming up on June 30 pretty quickly here. I wonder if you could give a little bit more details about when we should expect something to happen there. And if nothing does happen, does that force you then to make a decision on whether you’re making the interest payments on June 30. And then just again this is all one question but finally on the June 30 payment, is it like a 30-day grace period before you are in default on making those payments? Thanks. Juan Figuereo So let me see how I would take that. First, the early discussions with the local banks were different from the discussions we’re having today. The initial discussions were kind of to inform and give them a hint that we could be having some challenges when it came -- the measurement date came around. The more recent discussions are about we’re not going to make it come the measurement date, but here is the story, here is the business plan. And so based upon what they have seen in the business plan, I think it would be fair to say that the banks want to work us, they want to take their time to review the business plan. And they also, I think as would be expected, want to see how we’re going to address our overall liquidity issues, because addressing just one market doesn’t solve the bigger problem right since we fund from the parent company the markets. But generally, I would say we have been very open with the banks. We have shown them our business plan and the reception has been positive. So we fully expect that we should have some kind of understanding, and I don’t want to use agreements because I don't know if we will have something signed, but we will have some kind of understanding with the banks way before the measurement date. Walter Piecyk - BTIG And the measurement date is June 30? Juan Figuereo It is June 30, yes. Walter Piecyk - BTIG Sorry to be particular about this, but it’s May 12, so this is kind of we are at way before June 30. Juan Figuereo Yes. So I know you understand right when you’re having conversations with the banks, it’s up to them, not up to you. So I can tell you that the conversations are ongoing. This is a process. They are receptive again because it’s a good story. If you are bank sitting in Brazil, it’s a story of growth, I see the business picking up momentum. We heard from Gokul that we are having number one, number two position in the markets from a Net Promoter Score, leading share of net adds in our markets for several months in a row now. So the banks like what they are hearing and they are working with us, but they will take their time. Walter Piecyk - BTIG And then just procedurally on your senior debt payments that are due, can you just walk us through what the obligations are and what leeway you have in and isn’t there like a 30-day period as far as making those exact payments? I am just trying to understand what the facts are and when you have to make payments and what timeline that gives you on evaluating your strategic possibilities, I guess, if they are any? Thanks. Juan Figuereo Yes. So first on the 30-day grace period, it is correct, there is a grace period. The next significant payment is in August, it’s August 15. And like our approach with the banks, we would like to have a definitive answer on which path we are going to take on the options in front of us before we have to face that big payment in August. Walter Piecyk - BTIG Can you comment today whether you are actually going to be making those June 30 payments, or are you just not commenting on that at this point? Juan Figuereo We are not commenting on that at this point. Walter Piecyk - BTIG Got it. Thank you. Operator Our next question is from the line of Ron Consiglio with UBS. Please go ahead. Ron Consiglio - UBS Could you give us some update on what you’re seeing in Brazil and Mexico through April? Juan Figuereo So I think I will -- we’ve had a very good first quarter in Brazil as part of Project Accelerate that we’ve talked about in the past. We’ve said that we’re introducing some great plans which offer great value to our consumers. We’ve been investing in distribution channels in media in range of devices. And all that, as you can see, has paid off in the first quarter. But in Brazil, sequentially, we’ve increased gross adds 30% and got significant traction on 3G, which is now about 60% of our overall loading, which we expect to increase as we move along here. Now without giving you any exact numbers on April, I would say that that traction is continuing. But having said that, as part of Project Accelerate, I would also say that the kinds of plans that we started offering are kind of entry level plans and that over time we expect to make fine-tuning changes to kind of change the price value equation, so that we start increasing margins on those plans. So that is an ongoing process that we’ll continue. So I think we’re seeing good traction as we go into April. Now with reference to Mexico, you’ve heard us say that we’ve introduced a similar kind of thought process with the 600 peso rate plan, which offers great value in the marketplace. Initial traction is very good in that plan. We feel very good about it. But again, the philosophy is similar. This is, as part of Accelerate, an entry level plan, which we will start making changes to as we move along and start increasing the margins. Ron Consiglio - UBS So when would you expect to get back to positive net adds in Mexico? And in Brazil, I guess, more specifically, you mentioned that you had increasing net adds from October forward. Would we see a continued growth in net adds in the subsequent months? Gokul Hemmady I think that a some amount of seasonality that’s going to happen with the world cup coming up in June here and then into July. But absent that, I would say that number one, the focus has been on subscriber growth. And as we move along here, as you heard both me, Steve, and Juan, say, the focus is now on really translating that subscriber growth into revenue growth and then profitability. And that is really the next area of focus for us in terms of making sure that the ARPU is expanded. We have much more stability in ARPU that we address things like stimulating usage, making sure that the migration from higher rate plans to lower rate plans are effectively addressed, and those kinds of things. So that’s really the focus while making sure that we have a good growth in subscribers. Ron Consiglio - UBS Okay. And then, can you give us some color… Steve Shindler This is Steve. I’m just going to add some color on the Mexico piece. As I mentioned in my closing remarks, we’ve done a lot to stabilize the processes and the operational components to get ourselves back into the growth mode and the next critical phase for us is to turn that into subscriber growth. We have the tools now in place that we didn’t have before the 3G network is complete. We’ve got the wider portfolio of devices, the nationwide coverage. The success that we’re seeing in Brazil gives us the confidence that we can do the same in Mexico. We’ve taken the steps to address the issues that led to a loss in customer confidence. The most important, which is a significant improvement in network performance, where we’re ranked number one or number two in all of the independent studies. So combined that with the focus of the efforts we have on sales channel optimization and improving productivity, we’ve done all the thing necessary to get us back into growth mode. Ron Consiglio - UBS Excellent. And then if you wouldn't mind, could you give us a sense for the types of customers that you are now attracting primarily with iDEN, it seems you are very focused on the business customer. Have you been able to hold onto those types of customers and how far down market have you gone? Gokul Hemmady So I think this is a very important question in Brazil. A lot of our loading is really -- all of our gross adds are postpaid, that’s number one. Number two, even within postpaid, I would say that we -- our concentration is much more on the higher end portion of the postpaid. So our 99 real plan is getting significant traction and therefore substantial portion of our gross add loading is 99 real plan.  I would say about 35%, 40% of our loading is businesses and the balance is consumers and pretty well balanced between Rio and Sao Paulo. And I would say it’s similar in Mexico, although some of the introduction of those plans are a little bit early. We have little more history in Brazil but early indications are that it’s similar in Mexico. Ron Consiglio - UBS That’s great. Thank you. Gokul Hemmady Thank you. Operator Our next question is from the line of Jacob Steinfeld with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead sir. Jacob Steinfeld - J.P. Morgan Hi, good morning. Steve Shindler Good morning. Jacob Steinfeld - J.P. Morgan I have a bit of a follow-up on the timing question in terms of your decision. So what’s the minimum amount of cash you feel you need to meet the needs at your foreign subsidiary level going forward? Juan Figuereo So we have said in the past and this is back, I think when we still own Peru that we would like to keep about $1 billion on the balance sheet. That was not an expression of the minimum cash required. It was what we thought we would like to have. If you look at strictly from a minimum cash standpoint, we have commitment both in Mexico and Brazil to keep about $100 million down in the local market in the operation. That’s not the minimum we need to operate the business but that’s the minimum that we need given the contractual commitments with lenders. Jacob Steinfeld - J.P. Morgan It is $100 million in each, Mexico and Brazil? Juan Figuereo Yes. Jacob Steinfeld - J.P. Morgan And then but on top of that, you have around $150 million in Argentina. So, I guess I'm just trying to understand pretty soon, you are running into a cash crunch and you mentioned you are looking at strategic options in Chile and Argentina. But in both of those countries to the extent you enter into a cell, I would presume you need regulatory approval and you will need to wait for that cash. So how are you thinking about the timing around those alternatives given the tight cash position? Juan Figuereo Okay. So let me tell you about the cash and Steve can talk a little bit about this strategic alternatives process. So the cash that we have in Argentina is essentially trapped cash. If we could move to cash freely out of Argentina, we would just keep the fraction of what is there now. But under the current environment in the country, we cannot repatriate the cash. We are unable to pay ourselves intercompany dividends and so our ability to move the cash is really limited. For all intents and purposes, we don’t have easy access to that cash. In Chile, we don’t keep any cash. We basically fund the business as required. And will let Steve comment on the process. Steve Shindler Yeah. So obviously, we understand certainly the pressure that we have on the liquidity product across the entire company. And in the markets that you pointed out, there is been discussions and then we’ve been in pursuit for quite sometime to find solutions to the liquidity issues, particularly related to the smaller markets of Argentina and Chile. There is nothing at this time that we have to report other than to confirm that. We continue to pursue aggressively in light of our understanding of the liquidity pressures that we face. Jacob Steinfeld - J.P. Morgan Okay. Great. Thank you. My last question was -- is the fact that you have negative equity now on the balance sheet a concern or does that have any implications? Juan Figuereo The concern is around the liquidity and I believe there are no triggers of anything on the negative equity. But of course, we are concerned about having enough liquidity, enough runway to complete the business plan, that's really is what striving our thinking right now. Jacob Steinfeld - J.P. Morgan Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Tahmin Clarke Operator, we’ve hit our 9:15 window. Operator Very good. Back to you, sir with your closing remarks. Steve Shindler Okay. Well, this is Steve and once again, we appreciate your interest and support of our company and thank you for joining us on the call this morning. Operator Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Ma’am, you may begin. Kris Newton Hello and thank you for joining us on our Q4 fiscal year 2017 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today’s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2018 and our expectations regarding future revenue growth, improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including the macroeconomic and IT spending environments and our ability to successfully innovate in the growth areas of the market, gain market share, expand our operating margin and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q, our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2016 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. I will now turn the call over to George. George Kurian Thanks, Kris and good afternoon everyone. The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to fiscal 2017 for NetApp. Our continued focus and disciplined execution yielded yet another quarter of solid results on the top and bottom lines. Revenue for the fourth quarter was at the high end of our guidance range with both operating margin and earnings per share above our guidance. We have returned the company to revenue growth with improved profitability and earnings. By innovating to redefine traditional markets, bring enterprise-grade technology to emerging areas of the market and meet the evolving needs of our growing customer base, we are creating new opportunities for NetApp, gaining market share and expanding our addressable market. When I became CEO, I set 3 priorities for the business: pivot to the growth areas of the market; reduce the cost structure of the company; maintain a robust capital allocation program. This intense focus has helped us systematically improve our execution and drive efficiency through the business and ultimately meet or beat our goals. We have successfully delivered against each priority and have effectively completed the first phase of our transformation. I’ll provide more detail on this first phase and then share some perspective on the focus areas for the next. Consistent with the plan we’ve laid out, the headwinds from mature solutions, add-on hardware, OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode are lessening. In Q4, product revenue from mature solutions declined 7% year-over-year. Going into FY ‘18, the transition from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP is largely behind us, and we have a renewed focus on hardware and software OEM opportunities. These both will further moderate the decline in mature solutions. Strategic solutions, which position us to lead in the new era of IT, was 70% of net product revenue, up 24% year-over-year. By emphasizing our Data Fabric strategy and our flash-enabled cloud integrated strategic solution, we’ve driven a re-acceleration of the business. Our success in pivoting to the growth areas of the market is evident not only in the shift of our product revenue to strategic solutions, but also in the mix of our systems business, the majority of which now comes from products in the high-growth all-flash array market. We are in the early innings of the movement to flash and have a significant growth opportunity ahead as we penetrate our installed base and displace competitors’ installations with our all-flash solutions. Clustered ONTAP allows customers to modernize their infrastructure by replacing stand-alone silos of storage and monolithic frame arrays with a scale-out, software-defined, shared storage platform, delivering seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk, public and private clouds. We have successfully migrated over 50% of the capacity and almost 50% of the FAS systems in our large installed base to clustered ONTAP. In Q4, clustered ONTAP was deployed on 95% of FAS systems shipped. And as I noted earlier, the transition from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP is now behind us. NetApp leads the industry in the transition to flash with cloud-integrated solutions that provide unrivaled efficiency, speed, scale and data management. We strengthened our number two position in calendar year 2016 and our growth continues to outpace the market and competitors, both large and small. We have entered into an agreement to acquire Plexistor, a company with technology and expertise in ultra-low latency persistent memory. This differentiated intellectual property will help us further accelerate our leadership position and capture new application types and emerging workloads. For customers looking to modernize existing data centers, All Flash FAS deployed as both FAS engineered systems and FlexPod converged infrastructure solutions is the clear choice. We have been very successful replacing legacy frame array solutions from our competitors in Tier 1 SAN deployments, accessing a new market for us by disrupting it with flash. In 2016, NetApp was the fastest-growing of the leading SAN suppliers, a clear indicator that we are moving outside of our traditional installed base and expanding our opportunity. In Q4, our all-flash array business grew almost 140% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $1.7 billion, inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services. We are winning with flash and expanding our intellectual property in this market, positioning us for success in the multiyear transition from disk to flash. The all-flash FlexPod and our momentum in the channel helped to strengthen our #2 position in the converged infrastructure market and contributed to the 44% year-over-year growth of FlexPod revenue reported in IDC’s quarterly converged systems tracker for calendar Q4 2016. We also recently acquired Immersive Partner Solutions, a cloud-based converged infrastructure monitoring and compliance company. We will integrate this intellectual property into our FlexPod solutions to help customers further simplify and automate life cycle management and enhance our leadership in the converged infrastructure market. We are growing the SolidFire business at an accelerating pace through continued innovation and expanded reach. The FY ‘17 revenue performance with SolidFire was in line with the expectations we laid out at the time of acquisition, and SolidFire was significantly less dilutive to our overall operating results than we expected. On our last earnings call, we announced that we are further leveraging our SolidFire investment and expanding our growth potential by developing the next generation of hyper-converged infrastructure. Development is on track and we look forward to sharing more details later this quarter. Enterprises, cloud service providers and partners choose NetApp, because we enable their hybrid cloud strategies through our Data Fabric architecture. The NetApp Data Fabric delivers consistent and integrated data management services and applications for data insight, access, control, protection and security, enabling customers to unleash the full power of their data. We displaced Dell/EMC as a cloud service provider with our all-flash FlexPod solution for its SAP HANA implementation. The customer chose NetApp because of our value and industry leading functionality. We helped a leading wine producer and distributor, realize their hybrid cloud strategy with the all-flash NetApp private storage for cloud, ONTAP Cloud and OnCommand Insight to manage it all. Key requirements of this transaction were a cloud strategy and the ability to manage complex migrations. OnCommand Insight allows customers to look at disparate storage environments in their data center and increasingly in the hybrid cloud to make decisions about where they want to optimize resources. The strength and focus of OnCommand Insight allows us to displace legacy competitive solutions and it is now the leader in the storage and device management market. Ron will go into the details about our cost reductions, but I am pleased to announce that we overachieved in our goal of delivering a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million in OpEx and cost of sales. More importantly, we have made good progress towards focusing the business, driving disciplined portfolio management and systematically generating more efficiencies while setting a high bar for execution. Our capital allocation program includes the balance of shareholder returns and investment in the business. In FY ‘17, we returned over $900 million to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Additionally, we made organic and inorganic investments to support the long-term growth of the business, like the development of our ACI solution and continued innovation in all-flash arrays and hybrid cloud solutions. Having successfully completed the first phase of our transformation, we will now drive the second phase delivering sustained growth in the fast growing parts of the market while maintaining a focus on margins and productivity. Again, we will focus on three priorities; first, we will expand our total addressable market by growing our portfolio and the ways we deliver it, strengthening our leadership position in all-flash arrays and converged infrastructure markets, continuing to push into Tier 1 SAN opportunities, introducing our ACI solution as well as new cloud services and partnerships, reinvigorating our OEM program and addressing new buyers in new ways. Second, we will continue to make fundamental changes to drive productivity, enabling further investment in the business while continuing to expand our operating margins. And third, we will continue our robust capital allocation program, which includes the combination of shareholder returns and investment for the long-term growth of the business. FY ‘17 was a pivotal year for NetApp. We started the year with bold commitments and we delivered against all of them. We did what many said could not be done; return the company to growth while simultaneously expanding operating margins. With each successful step in our transformation, my confidence in our ability to create new opportunities and execute against those opportunities grows. As an independent player of scale, our openness creates a unique opportunity to partner broadly for successful customer outcomes. The mix of our business is weighted more towards the fastest growing parts of the market than our traditional competitors and we have significantly greater technology differentiation, customer relationships and scale in those growth areas than the new players who are trying to address them. As we enter FY ‘18, we are building on a strong foundation and are without question, the best positioned and the best executing in the industry. I will now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q4 and fiscal year 2017 financial performance and go-forward expectations. Ron? Ron Pasek Thanks George and good afternoon everyone. As a reminder, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today, unless otherwise noted. NetApp delivered a strong finish to fiscal 2017. Our results clearly demonstrate the substantial progress we are making toward transforming the business, driving sustained growth and addressing the rapidly changing market. Before discussing our full year results and future expectations, I will provide detail on our performance in the fourth quarter. Q4 net revenues were at the high end of our guidance at $1.48 billion. As we anticipated, the growth of our strategic solutions more than offset the declines in our mature solutions and started driving net revenue growth in the second half of 2017. The year-over-year Q4 net revenue growth of more than 7% is clear evidence of this dynamic. Product revenue of $852 million grew over 12% year-over-year, led by flash and the continued strength of our strategic solutions. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues increased 1% year-over-year. Gross margin of 62.5% was 1 point better than Q3 and above our guidance range. Product gross margin of 48.9% increased about 3 points sequentially and 2 points year-over-year, reflecting improved sales discipline, fewer promotions and lower reserves [ph]. Software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat sequentially and increased just over 1 point on a year-over-year basis. Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin decreased over 1 point sequentially, but increased over 2 points year-over-year, reflecting the benefits from our transformation initiatives. Operating expenses of $619 million increased 7% sequentially, reflecting higher variable compensation due to the higher than expected revenue growth. Despite slightly higher operating expenses, our operating margin of 20.7% was above our guidance range. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.1%, an increase of 3.5 points sequentially, reflecting a higher mix of U.S. profits. We ended the quarter with 278 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. EPS of $0.86 exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.02 as a result of higher revenue and higher gross margin. Cash and balance sheet metrics remained healthy in the quarter. Our cash conversion cycle improved 13 days year-over-year, reflecting 24 days of combined improvement in DSO and DPO from our transformation initiatives, partially offset by a 10-day increase in DIO. Additionally, cash flow from operations grew 6% year-over-year to $365 million. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue declined 1% year-over-year due to lower ASPs and to a lesser extent, execution issues within renewals. Free cash flow grew 5% year-over-year to $327 million. Inventory turns decreased by 9 turns on a year-over-year basis, reflecting increased flash inventory and timing. To reiterate, we are confident that we have secured adequate NAND supply to meet anticipated demand for the remainder of this calendar year. We have a unique advantage through our deep business and technical partnerships with our NAND and SSD suppliers. We partnered to help them bring their new technologies to market faster and consequently maximize our continuity of supply. We repurchased $129 million of NetApp shares and paid $51 million in cash dividends during the quarter. Finally, we ended the year with approximately $4.9 billion in cash and short-term investments, with roughly 9% held by our domestic entities. Now turning to our full year 2017 results, net revenues of $5.52 billion were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2016. Gross margin of 62.3% was relatively flat compared to the previous year and was within our guidance range. Operating margin of 17.2% improved almost 4 points versus fiscal 2016 and was above our guidance range of 15% to 17%. In fiscal 2017, we took important and in some cases, difficult steps that were necessary to lower our cost structure and improve the alignment of our resources to our strategy. We committed to reducing our cost structure across both cost of sales and OpEx, yielding a net annualized run rate savings of $130 million after investment in SolidFire and other growth areas of the business. I am pleased to report that we exceeded this commitment, achieving annualized net run rate savings of approximately $140 million despite the impact of higher variable compensation in Q4. Our effective tax rate was 19.2% and 1.5 points above expectations, reflecting the higher mix of U.S. profits. EPS of $2.73 for the full year increased 28% from 2016. We continued to deliver on our capital allocation strategy through a combination of dividends and share repurchases in excess of $900 million. We returned over 110% of free cash flow to shareholders this year. Additionally, we have completed over $1.7 billion of a $2.5 billion repurchase program we announced in February of 2015. We remain firmly committed to delivering shareholder value and are on track to complete the remaining $800 million by the end of May 2018. Today, I am pleased to announce a 5% increase in our next cash dividend to $0.20 per share, which will be paid on July 26, 2017. Now to guidance. I am confident that we are making the right investments to compete and win not only in the market segments where we are strong today, but also in the new high-growth areas of the market. We are making tough decisions in key investments to expand our TAM and drive strong financial performance over the long term. Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect moderated revenue growth to ramp throughout the year, consistent with our normal seasonal trends. We are forecasting a gross margin range of 62% to 63% and expect operating margin in the range of 18% to 20%. We are committed to delivering low double-digit EPS growth and expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 19% to 20%. Additionally, we expect to continue generating meaningful free cash flow in the range of 17% to 19% of revenues, enabling us to invest in growth as well as continue to return significant capital to our shareholders in fiscal 2018. With that in mind, I would like to take a moment to remind you of seasonal trends relating to our operating margin. We typically build momentum through the fiscal year. As such, Q1 is generally our softest quarter for operating margin, reflecting seasonally lower Q1 revenue as well as seasonally higher operating expenses mainly from salary adjustments. That said, now on to guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We are forecasting a revenue range of $1.24 billion to $1.39 billion. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 2%. We expect gross margins of approximately 62% to 63%. We are targeting Q1 operating margins of 13.5% to 14.5%, reflecting the seasonality I just discussed. We expect EPS to be between $0.49 and $0.57. This implies a 15% growth year-over-year at the midpoint, which is consistent with our typical Q1 contribution to full year EPS and consistent with the long-term model of low double-digit EPS growth that I shared with you at our recent Analyst Day. In closing, I am very pleased with NetApp’s performance in fiscal 2017. We have sharpened our focus, accelerated our innovation and are shifting the investments toward the fastest-growing parts of the market while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value through improved profitability and cash flow. The substantial progress we have made drives my confidence in NetApp’s growth potential and future. With that, I will hand it back to Kris to open the call for question-and-answer session. Kris? Kris Newton We’ll now open the call for question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Andrew Nowinski Alright, thanks for taking the question and great quarter again. So your product gross margin improved nicely again this quarter, and I think you mentioned fewer promotions. Can you just give us any color on the promotion that you are no longer using and then maybe even a color on how you are competing against Dell/EMC as it relates to pricing? Thanks. Ron Pasek Sure. I think we hinted at this at our Analyst Day. There was a cDOT promotion we had run for quite some time, and we were very clear that it pretty much ran its course and it, in fact, did. That definitely helped. As well, I think there were a couple other things that contributed, including better sales execution and discipline, and we didn’t have the charge we had in Q3 of ‘17 as well. George Kurian We have also introduced a new class of high-value products and ONTAP 9.1 software that continues to differentiate our portfolio. So, overall, strong new products differentiation there, continued sales force discipline and execution as well as removing the clustered ONTAP migration program now that the majority of the migrations are done. With regard to EMC, as we said, we have competitive programs in place and we see continued momentum from those competitive programs. In Q4, we accelerated the rate of EMC take-outs for 2 – 1 a day, and we mentioned that it was once every few days at the Analyst Day. I think in Q4, we have accelerated that to once per day, representing the fact that we have got the best all-flash array portfolio in the market. Andrew Nowinski Great. Thanks a lot. Kris Newton Thanks, Andy. Next question? Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian White with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open. Brian White Hi, yes. George, could you talk a little bit about the trends you are seeing in the U.S. public spending vertical for the quarter and maybe for orders moving forward? I know one of the big OEMs highlighted weakness in that vertical over the past week. Thank you. George Kurian We had a good quarter in public sector, representing both market share gains as well as execution by our field organizations. I would tell you that the outlook for public sector depends on the budget that the new administration passes. I think we have a broad book of business in the public sector market. So my sense is that it’s too early to tell, but defense is probably strengthened and civilian is probably hampered a little bit by the – if the budget passes the way it’s shaped. We have got a broad book of business, and we continue to demonstrate leadership and execution in that market. Brian White Great. Thanks. Kris Newton Thanks, Brian. Next question? Operator And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri Scribner Hi, thanks. Ron, you mentioned that you expect revenue growth to moderate – I think you said moderate, moderating revenue growth through the year. Can you talk a little bit about what that means exactly? I think you are – the midpoint of your guidance is just 1.6% revenue growth. Is revenue going to accelerate as we go through the year? Or is it going to be kind of in the same levels? How are you thinking about that as we progress through the year? Thanks. Ron Pasek Yes, what I tried to say, Sherri, is coming off of Q4, where we grew 7%, down to Q1, where we are seeing a roughly 2% year-over-year growth. We do expect that to accelerate through the year. Sherri Scribner Thank you. Kris Newton Thanks, Sherri. Next question? Operator And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers Yes thank you. At the Analyst Day, you talked a little bit about the penetration rate of your customer base that shifted to all-flash. I am curious if you could give us an update with regard to that and how we should think about that looking out over the next 12 months. Where do you think that possibly could go? George Kurian I think we are in the early innings of the transition to all-flash. I would tell you our total opportunity is not only within our installed base where all-flash systems are less than 10% of our large and growing installed base, but also in displacing competitor frame arrays and legacy storage environments. So we are in the early stages of a multiyear transition from disk to flash, and we feel very well positioned to capitalize on that market transition. We are the fastest-growing vendor in the all-flash array market. It’s outpacing our competitors, large and small. I think if you look at our numbers, we are up 140% year-over-year as compared to others who are in the 30% range. And if you look quarter-on-quarter, we are up 24% as opposed to them down sequentially in the same range. So we feel very, very good about our portfolio. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Jayson Noland Okay great. I wanted to ask on the revenue guidance. You mentioned accelerate through the year. Can you grow product revenue for FY ‘18? Ron Pasek Well, yes, coming off the quarter in Q4 where we did, yes, absolutely. That is the plan. Jayson Noland For the full year F ‘18 over F ‘17, no? George Kurian Absolutely. Jayson Noland Okay, thank you. Kris Newton Thanks, Jayson. Next question? Operator And our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kulbinder Garcha Thank you for the questions. I guess given where you are guiding, it looks like operating margin for the first quarter you have to exit the year probably at peak levels in the low-20s, I think is the other trajectory we should think about or is there more of a step-up sooner in the year? Thanks. Ron Pasek Well, Kulbinder, as you saw this year, we started out quite low as well and accelerated from 12% in Q1 of ‘17 to over 20% in Q4 of ‘17. So yes, that is the seasonality I was addressing in my prepared remarks, so absolutely. Kris Newton Next question? Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Simona Jankowski Hi. Thank you. Just a couple of follow-ups from that also, in terms of the out-performance in product gross margins in the quarter, is an element of that driven by increasing prices to pass-through some of the NAND cost increases. And then Ron, for the first quarter, you talked about the OpEx seasonality, is there a seasonality relative to gross margin you would point us to or a mix impact. And then finally, from a long-term perspective, what is the natural product gross margin that you think is realistic for you guys, can you get back to the low-50s range? Thank you. Ron Pasek Yes. So the first part of your question Simona, so yes, I think what we had indicated is that we did raise prices in many of our flash products as a result of NAND prices increasing to us. And so in many cases, we did pass that along. The only seasonality you will see in gross margin relates sometimes to Q2 on a product basis. We see year end public sector revenue and margin go up. Otherwise, it’s not that cyclical. I would hesitate to give a long-term guide on product margin. It is certainly our intent and I mentioned this at the Analyst Day that we should be doing better than we are and that is part of our AOP, or annual operating plan, for FY ‘18. Simona Jankowski Thank you. Kris Newton Thanks Simona. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Maynard Um Hi. Thanks. Can you just talk about the change in your go-to-market that you talked about at your Analyst Day, how much have you done and any qualitative or quantitative thoughts you can share on what you are seeing. And then similarly, with the compensation structure changes, have you seen any disruptions or any kind of turnover in sales that have been outside the norm? Thanks. George Kurian I think first of all, the confidence in our employees, customers and reseller partners is exceptionally good. I think the turnaround has been seen positively by everybody and we are attracting the world’s best talent to NetApp. I think in terms of the compensation plan, the coverage model and some of the things that we talked about at the Financial Analyst Day, we recently implemented that at the start of May, which is the plan for the new fiscal year, fiscal ‘18. And so we are going to play that out through the course of this year. I think we entered the year with a really strong capacity number in terms of quota bearing heads, which is what we had said that as part of transformation, we are going to redeploy investments from non-quota bearing roles to quota bearing roles and we feel really good. The momentum in the product portfolio demonstrated market share gains and the right amount of capacity to execute our game plan for this year. And as I mentioned, we intend to grow product revenue year-on-year this year, accelerating through the course of the year. Maynard Um Great. Thank you. Kris Newton Thank you, Maynard. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Alex Kurtz Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I apologize if you have already touched on this, but when you look at your all-flash growth, can you help us quantify how much of that’s coming from the installed base refresh over maybe the last nine months or so and how much of that is net new customer growth? George Kurian We are gaining new customers, new workloads and existing customers. And the two of them are represented by the fact that we are based on public market data from IDC, for example, the fastest growing major SAN vendor, fiber channel storage vendor, which is a net new market for NetApp. We have converted a small percentage, as I mentioned less than 10% of our install base to all-flash arrays. So the majority of our growth is coming from outside our installed base. Alex Kurtz Okay, alright. Thank you. Kris Newton Thank you, Alex. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox Thanks. Good afternoon. I am just a little confused on the gross margin guidance, so you are talking about doing 62% to 63% in the first quarter and then also for the full year even though you are talking about accelerating sales growth, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes between Q1 and say the full year guidance? Thanks. Ron Pasek I mean so we generally see Q1 as fairly flat to Q4. We have a little higher mix of services revenues, which usually helps gross margin. However, we do have NAND costs still increasing, so that’s a little bit of a headwind. As I mentioned at Analyst Day, I think that will start to dissipate later in the year and certainly into next year. We are maintaining a fairly conservative range for the year, where we are trying some new things with compensation in the sales force. And we want to see them take hold. We will see how that goes. I think it can only be upside. Steven Fox Great. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Mark Kelleher Great. Thanks for taking the question. You talked about reinvigorating your OEM program, can you maybe talk a little bit about what your plans are there? George Kurian I think it’s too early to comment. I think we do see the opportunity to access new markets and new geographies using both software as well as hardware. So we have succeeded in some of the smart city projects that are going on in Asia Pacific – in the Asia Pacific region, using a new type of integrator that combines NetApp storage with other components of a broad based smart city solution. That’s one example. We will communicate more through the course of the year as news becomes available. But in the broad context, the combination of software assets from NetApp, like ONTAP Select or SolidFire software as well as the opportunity to create new solutions through new pathways makes us believe that OEM is no longer a place which declines, but rather flattens out or starts to grow moderately. Mark Kelleher Okay. Thanks. Kris Newton Thanks Mark. Next question? Operator And our next question comes from the line of Jim Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is now open. James Kisner That’s James, not Jim, to make sure. So on the – just a quick clarification, my next sort of question, on – you mentioned, I think the excess and obviously the inventory helping product margin, I want to make sure that that was still up, helping non-GAAP product margin and maybe you could quantify how much that helped. And then just separately, on just the – congrats on the minus 7% better mature solutions declines, are there any particular pieces in that business that outperformed that really helped you with that, I guess, you said differently, what’s the product line that did the best year-over-year that drove that result? Thanks. Ron Pasek So on the – I was really trying to point out is we had that as a headwind in Q3. It certainly wasn’t there in Q4. The main pieces of benefit were of course better sales execution and the removal of the promo for cDOT. George Kurian I think with regard to the mature solutions, I think first of all, we had said that as – the three components of mature solutions were add-on storage, OEM and 7-Mode. And they are increasingly becoming a smaller part of our overall business. So the year-on-year declines in them are frankly, smaller than they would be. The preponderant majority of that business is OEM and add-on storage at this point. And therefore, those will not be, as I said subject to the same rate of declines. 7-Mode is now a much, much smaller percentage of our business. If you think about the shipments out of the factory, they are 95% clustered ONTAP. And so we think that mature overall, as we had said many times, will be a place of stability or modest – very modest decline going forward. James Kisner Thanks very much. Kris Newton Thank you, James. Next question? Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. David Ryzhik Hi. Thanks so much. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini. Your anticipation for accelerating product growth throughout the year, does that include new products such as hyper-converged ramping. And the second part of my question is regarding cDOT migration, what is the strategy with legacy 7-Mode installations given that you are kind of signaling that your – that it’s behind us, what is the strategy, if any? Thanks. Ron Pasek So with respect to ramp of new products yes, in fact SolidFire continues to ramp in the year and some other new products that will come along. George Kurian So we feel good about the portfolio we have to-date that have – we have just finished a very strong quarter. We think that many of the solutions that we saw this quarter have expanded potential and we will continue to demonstrate additive innovations to the portfolio over the course of the year, stay tuned. With regard to the customer base and the partner channel on clustered ONTAP, we have migrated a substantial percentage of that customer base as we have communicated, 2 clustering from 7-Mode. We have also trained our partner channel and trained our customers to achieve those migrations themselves. So we have given them tools, methodologies and allowed them to shadow us as we help them do the migrations. The remainder of those migrations will happen at the pace that customers take on IT projects. They will be a part of the broader IT agenda of customers. And so we feel very good. We have got the big percentage of our installed base migrated. We have seen real success with both clustered ONTAP and all-flash clustered ONTAP, called All Flash FAS and we think that we have established a compelling value proposition for customers to migrate over the remainder of the installed base. David Ryzhik Great. Thank you. Kris Newton Thank you. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Srini Nandury with Summit Redstone. Your line is now open. Srini Nandury Alright. Thank you for taking my questions. Congratulations on a good quarter. You mentioned on the call that you are taking out EMC once a day. What products are you displacing? Are those primarily Dell products or EMC or both? George Kurian We are displacing the EMC products, primarily VMAXs and VNXs as we tear out old SAN environments and replace them with All Flash FAS. We are also looking forward to displacing old Isilon environments with ONTAP 9.2. So we... Srini Nandury Alright. Thank you, George. Kris Newton Thank you, Srini. Next question? Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Katy Huberty Thanks. Good afternoon. Ron, how should we think about operating expense trend for the full year fiscal ‘18 in light of R&D for adjacent markets and some of the go-to-market investments you talked about at the Analyst Day? Ron Pasek Yes. So what I mentioned at Analyst Day for the 3-year period, it would be roughly flat. I also mentioned we would see a slight bump in ‘18 as we will see given we need to give people raises. But other than that, it’s really pretty much flat to what we would have expected. Just to clarify one additional thing, Katy, what we are clear was that we are just continuing to do transformation that we would be using that as a tool to disinvest and reinvest in the business so that the reinvestment is not all incremental. Kris Newton Thanks, Katy. Next question? Operator And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani Thanks a lot, guys. I guess just a question on the component shortages. And maybe I missed this, but could you quantify what headwind did component shortages or price increases have for you in the April quarter and how do you think of that headwind in July? And if I understand the structure of your – securing the NAND supply dynamic properly, is it fair to think you have secured the supply, but pricing could still fluctuate and still could have a margin impact? Ron Pasek That’s right. I was hinting at that last quarter. We do secure the supply for the remainder of the calendar year, but we only do pricing for the next 90 days in advance. So it was about 1 point headwind in the Q4 quarter. It was about 0.5 point as we enter Q1. Kris Newton Alright. Thanks, Amit. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Rod Hall Yes, thanks for the question. I just wanted to check on the competitive dynamic, a couple of questions actually on this. One is Dell/EMC significantly increased their channel program at the beginning of the year, especially focused on storage. So I wonder if you could comment on whether you have seen any impacts from that and just kind of how that’s playing out in the market? And then I also wanted to talk a little about these price increases. Do you expect others to do the same? And what do you think the impact on market demand is going to be, your customers going to pause spending as we get toward the back end of this year as they think about NAND eventually clearing and pricing coming back down or do you think people will keep that ongoing? And then lastly, on NAND, I just want to ask that again. I mean, the data points in the quarter suggest that stabilization is not going to happen in the back end of this year as people have thought. Most – at least some of the suppliers are now pushing out supply/demand breakeven into middle or even into next year. So I wonder if you are thinking that things are going to stabilize at the end of the year. Maybe it’s a little bit optimistic. I would just like to get your comments on that. George Kurian Okay, that’s a lot of questions, but let me take them in sequence. With regard to EMC channel programs, we have a strong group of channel partners that do a lot of business with NetApp that are focused on NetApp. I think the success of our All Flash FAS products, the success of our competitive programs, the success of FlexPod in an all-flash configuration are all indications of the strength of our channels and the focus that we have. I think EMC may sweep up some of the marginal partners, but they are not the core focus of our channel program. The second is with regard to the pricing dynamics in customers, we are uniquely positioned with clustered ONTAP to enable customers to move workloads between an all-flash configuration and a hybrid flash configuration that combines flash with disk seamlessly. So, we are able to provide customers a choice of both. We did see strength in our hybrid flash platforms this quarter as well, but it’s too early to tell whether that was a reflection of pricing. It would be remiss of me to speculate on what other people would do. I think we felt that it was important for us to stay consistent to prior practice and future practice that we pass through to customers the increases in component costs as well as the decreases in component cost as they happen. Ron Pasek And then with respect to NAND supply, remember, we have strategic relationships with suppliers that allow us and afford us different dynamics than perhaps other people in the marketplace. So what I said today and previously are still consistent. So, we see our supply being in good shape and should free up later in the year and into next year. Rod Hall Okay, thank you. Kris Newton Thanks, Rod. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is now open. Nehal Chokshi Thank you. The driver on the pullback of the year-over-year growth for the July quarter, I mean, you had 7% year-over-year growth for the April quarter and you are guiding at a midpoint of 2%. Is there a story behind why you are guiding for that pullback on that growth? And I do have a follow-up as well. Ron Pasek Nothing other than what we indicated at the Analyst Day. So, we really are giving realistic and in some cases conservative estimates and we want to make sure we meet or beat every commitment we made, as we have the last four quarters. Nehal Chokshi Okay. Is it possible that the year ago comps is a lot easier than it was for the April quarter and that’s one of the things that’s going into that conservatism as well? Ron Pasek Actually, the year ago Q1 – Q1 of ‘17 was actually a pretty good quarter. It really was flat for product revenue. It was down slightly on services only, because we had a 13-week quarter versus 14 the year before. So, if anything, it’s a more difficult compare. Nehal Chokshi That’s what I meant, okay, sorry. And then my follow-up is that it looks like revenue from direct pathways took a step back in terms of the year-over-year growth profile while indirect accelerated. So, is there a story behind what seems to be two different tales for these two different pathways for market? George Kurian No, nothing substantive there. I think it’s just mix and transactions, timing of transactions. I don’t think there is anything systematic. I think we have had a good progress with our channel partners and we have seen strength in terms of total product revenue growth across both. FlexPod, in particular, we had a really strong year and second half of the year in particular with FlexPod through the FlexPod Advantage and All Flash FAS programs. So I would say that it probably reflects more the strength of the indirect channel through that model. Nehal Chokshi Okay, thank you. Kris Newton Thank you, Nehal. Next question? Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Simon Leopold Great, thank you. First, I just wanted to clarify within the guidance, I think it seems to imply your operating expenses rise sequentially. And just looking at prior years, sales and marketing sometimes moves up, sometimes moves down on what is typically a seasonally lower revenue quarter. Could you help us understand any of the moving parts that might be influencing OpEx in your July guidance? And then in terms of the broader question, I wanted to ask about the longer term strategy in terms of all flash because you’ve got hyper-converged product coming to market in three different all flash platforms. Is there some thought about trying to consolidate those platforms or looking for more synergies or are there synergies there and just not well appreciated? Thank you. Ron Pasek Yes. So on the walk on OpEx from Q4 to Q1, it’s simply the fact that we are giving people raises. We are down in Q1 ‘18 versus Q1 a year ago. And again, we are doing some disinvestments and reinvestments. So that is the really simple explanation. That’s it. George Kurian With regard to your second question, I would say we had very clear swim lanes and use cases that we described for our all-flash array platforms. And that allows customers to make ongoing purchase decisions with confidence in these roadmaps. With regard to offerings of both ONTAP and SolidFire, I would just tell you we have had a tradition of making ONTAP and SolidFire available as standalone systems as part of converged infrastructure, software and as a service model. And what you will see with SolidFire is its offering in a hyper-converged form factor. So it’s consistent with practice. Our customers like the fact that they can operate a storage environment across all of these use cases. It gives them a huge return on both training as well as automation and management and monitoring infrastructure, unlike our competitors who have a different operating system for every single use case. Simon Leopold Great. Thank you. That’s very helpful. Kris Newton Thanks Simon. Next question? Operator And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open. Mark Moskowitz Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just want to build off of Rod’s question from earlier regarding competitive dynamics, it seems like it could be more than just Dell EMC if we are not mistaken in terms of Pure Storage starting to gain momentum of FlashBlade and also HP Enterprise acquiring Nimble, it just seems like NetApp now is in the crosshairs of a lot of different targets, you are a bull’s eye of some of these other players out there, is this part of the reason why you are being a little more cautious on the guide and not really providing a full year revenue outlook, because you could have a lot more vectors hurting you? George Kurian Not at all, I think we feel real confident, right. If you look at the strategic portfolio, it accelerated through the year both in terms of its size as a percentage of our business as well as growth rates. Just take a look, last quarter, it was up 22% on product revenue; strategic product revenue this quarter, 24%. Last year, it was 14% at this time. So we feel real good about the product portfolio. I think it’s – there is two things, right. I think one is we want to make sure that when we give you guidance, we can achieve those estimates and it’s really that. And then the second is we continue to watch the macro. And as we get more color through the course of the year, we will certainly give you a better outlook as it becomes available. But it has got nothing to do with competitive dynamics. If you look at our market share numbers in all-flash arrays, we are outpacing all these guys. I would tell you that some of the competitor moves are desperation moves to catch us rather than us feeling worried about them. Kris Newton Thank you, Mark. Next question? Operator And our next question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Your line is now open. Eric Martinuzzi Yes. I may have missed this earlier, but what was the headcount – what did you finish the headcount with for FY ‘17 and what’s your expectation for headcount for FY – sorry, finish for FY ‘17 and your expectation for FY ‘18? Ron Pasek So we do not plan to add any net new headcount in FY ‘18. We finished the year at 10,103 employees. Eric Martinuzzi Got it. Thanks. Kris Newton Thanks Eric. Next question? Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP. Your line is now open. Erik Suppiger Yes. Can you just expand on the Plexistor acquisition, how big was that? George Kurian It’s a small number of employees. It is factored into the operating margin guidance that we gave you. So it will not be dilutive to operating margins. And at this point, we are not disclosing the terms of the transaction. Erik Suppiger Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton Thanks Erik. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Jim Suva Thank you very much. Maybe I am doing my math wrong or something, but can you help me out, is your EPS guidance range bigger now than it has been historically in the past and if my math is correct, can you help us understand why bigger range? Ron Pasek Yes. What we did last year was had a bigger range to revenue, but it wasn’t mirrored in EPS. So all I did was make them equal, so that it’s more in line with the broader range we had established for revenue. Jim Suva Got it. Thank you so much. Operator Thank you. And your next question comes from John Lucia with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. John Lucia Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify on the revenue growth acceleration throughout FY ‘18, is that total revenue, product revenue or both? Ron Pasek Both. John Lucia Okay. And just to be clear again, you are expecting acceleration every single quarter so that Q4 has the highest growth rate, correct? Ron Pasek That would be our – well, not necessarily growth rate, but it would have our highest – it would be our highest revenue quarter for the year and that would be our traditional seasonal pattern, yes. John Lucia Okay. And then with respect to the NAND supply, you said that NetApp is well positioned because you have the ability to sell the hybrid and bring the price down given the HCD components, are customers really adjusting their purchasing decisions, because of a slightly – a slight price increase, it seems like if a customer settles on an all-flash solution, it’s kind of a long-term strategic decision that wouldn’t be influenced or changed to go to a hybrid solution by short-term pricing increases, so if you could elaborate on that, that would be helpful? George Kurian Yes. Flash still has – even with an increase in the cost of an SSD on $1 per gigabyte basis, flash still has compelling advantages from a total cost of ownership, right, density, power consumption, operational benefits. So there is a lot of other reasons why people would continue to choose flash. I think what we find is, we continued to have this benefit that when we position our solution to customers, they can buy into an architecture that ensures them against material moves in the price, right. Unlike our competitors who only have an all-flash storage system, we can go ahead and tell a customer, buy our clustered ONTAP architecture. And you know what, if the price of flash goes up substantially for a period of time, you can deployed a disk-based solution or a hybrid solution for those discretionary workloads that absolutely do not need an all-flash environment, right. And that’s really how we position it. Flash continues to have material advantages over disk from a total cost of ownership perspective. That needs to be factored into the calculations. John Lucia Okay. Thank you very much. Kris Newton Thanks John. Next question? Operator Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan Yes. Thanks. Ron, sorry if I missed this, but can you just comment on the OpEx seasonality through the course of the year? Thanks. Ron Pasek Yes. I mean as I said, we see a little bump up in Q1 simply because we are giving people raises. Absent that, what you tend to see is it follow essentially variable comp, which would be higher in the second half of the year and that’s really about it. Again, we are in a net zero headcount growth environment, so you shouldn’t see any growth in headcount causing any cyclicality in OpEx. Wamsi Mohan Okay. Thanks. Kris Newton Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Wamsi. I will turn it back to George for closing comments. George Kurian Thanks Kris. We successfully completed the first phase of our transformation. We delivered against all our commitments for fiscal year ‘17 and returned the company to growth with expanded earnings growth. We are well positioned for sustained growth going forward. The majority of our systems business is in the high growth all-flash array market and the market is in the early days of the shift from disk to flash. Our compelling hyper-converged infrastructure solution will leapfrog the first generation HCI products by bringing HCI to the enterprise with cloud integration and the ability to run multiple workloads on a shared infrastructure. And we continue to expand our opportunity through organic and inorganic innovation. Entering the next phase of our transformation, we will focus on three priorities; expanding our opportunity with continued emphasis on the growth areas of the market, the way we deliver our solutions and reaching new buyers, making fundamental changes to enable reinvestment in the business while continuing to drive the expansion of our operating margins, as we have demonstrated this year and continuing our robust and balanced capital allocation program. Thank you to all our partners and shareholders for supporting us during this period of transition. And I want to say a special thank you to the NetApp team for leading into transformation and accelerating our turnaround. I am proud of our progress and especially of you, our world class team. I look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference call. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Andrew Nowinski Alright, thanks for taking the question and great quarter again. So your product gross margin improved nicely again this quarter, and I think you mentioned fewer promotions. Can you just give us any color on the promotion that you are no longer using and then maybe even a color on how you are competing against Dell/EMC as it relates to pricing? Thanks. Ron Pasek Sure. I think we hinted at this at our Analyst Day. There was a cDOT promotion we had run for quite some time, and we were very clear that it pretty much ran its course and it, in fact, did. That definitely helped. As well, I think there were a couple other things that contributed, including better sales execution and discipline, and we didn’t have the charge we had in Q3 of ‘17 as well. George Kurian We have also introduced a new class of high-value products and ONTAP 9.1 software that continues to differentiate our portfolio. So, overall, strong new products differentiation there, continued sales force discipline and execution as well as removing the clustered ONTAP migration program now that the majority of the migrations are done. With regard to EMC, as we said, we have competitive programs in place and we see continued momentum from those competitive programs. In Q4, we accelerated the rate of EMC take-outs for 2 – 1 a day, and we mentioned that it was once every few days at the Analyst Day. I think in Q4, we have accelerated that to once per day, representing the fact that we have got the best all-flash array portfolio in the market. Andrew Nowinski Great. Thanks a lot. Kris Newton Thanks, Andy. Next question? Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian White with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open. Brian White Hi, yes. George, could you talk a little bit about the trends you are seeing in the U.S. public spending vertical for the quarter and maybe for orders moving forward? I know one of the big OEMs highlighted weakness in that vertical over the past week. Thank you. George Kurian We had a good quarter in public sector, representing both market share gains as well as execution by our field organizations. I would tell you that the outlook for public sector depends on the budget that the new administration passes. I think we have a broad book of business in the public sector market. So my sense is that it’s too early to tell, but defense is probably strengthened and civilian is probably hampered a little bit by the – if the budget passes the way it’s shaped. We have got a broad book of business, and we continue to demonstrate leadership and execution in that market. Brian White Great. Thanks. Kris Newton Thanks, Brian. Next question? Operator And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri Scribner Hi, thanks. Ron, you mentioned that you expect revenue growth to moderate – I think you said moderate, moderating revenue growth through the year. Can you talk a little bit about what that means exactly? I think you are – the midpoint of your guidance is just 1.6% revenue growth. Is revenue going to accelerate as we go through the year? Or is it going to be kind of in the same levels? How are you thinking about that as we progress through the year? Thanks. Ron Pasek Yes, what I tried to say, Sherri, is coming off of Q4, where we grew 7%, down to Q1, where we are seeing a roughly 2% year-over-year growth. We do expect that to accelerate through the year. Sherri Scribner Thank you. Kris Newton Thanks, Sherri. Next question? Operator And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers Yes thank you. At the Analyst Day, you talked a little bit about the penetration rate of your customer base that shifted to all-flash. I am curious if you could give us an update with regard to that and how we should think about that looking out over the next 12 months. Where do you think that possibly could go? George Kurian I think we are in the early innings of the transition to all-flash. I would tell you our total opportunity is not only within our installed base where all-flash systems are less than 10% of our large and growing installed base, but also in displacing competitor frame arrays and legacy storage environments. So we are in the early stages of a multiyear transition from disk to flash, and we feel very well positioned to capitalize on that market transition. We are the fastest-growing vendor in the all-flash array market. It’s outpacing our competitors, large and small. I think if you look at our numbers, we are up 140% year-over-year as compared to others who are in the 30% range. And if you look quarter-on-quarter, we are up 24% as opposed to them down sequentially in the same range. So we feel very, very good about our portfolio. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Jayson Noland Okay great. I wanted to ask on the revenue guidance. You mentioned accelerate through the year. Can you grow product revenue for FY ‘18? Ron Pasek Well, yes, coming off the quarter in Q4 where we did, yes, absolutely. That is the plan. Jayson Noland For the full year F ‘18 over F ‘17, no? George Kurian Absolutely. Jayson Noland Okay, thank you. Kris Newton Thanks, Jayson. Next question? Operator And our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kulbinder Garcha Thank you for the questions. I guess given where you are guiding, it looks like operating margin for the first quarter you have to exit the year probably at peak levels in the low-20s, I think is the other trajectory we should think about or is there more of a step-up sooner in the year? Thanks. Ron Pasek Well, Kulbinder, as you saw this year, we started out quite low as well and accelerated from 12% in Q1 of ‘17 to over 20% in Q4 of ‘17. So yes, that is the seasonality I was addressing in my prepared remarks, so absolutely. Kris Newton Next question? Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Simona Jankowski Hi. Thank you. Just a couple of follow-ups from that also, in terms of the out-performance in product gross margins in the quarter, is an element of that driven by increasing prices to pass-through some of the NAND cost increases. And then Ron, for the first quarter, you talked about the OpEx seasonality, is there a seasonality relative to gross margin you would point us to or a mix impact. And then finally, from a long-term perspective, what is the natural product gross margin that you think is realistic for you guys, can you get back to the low-50s range? Thank you. Ron Pasek Yes. So the first part of your question Simona, so yes, I think what we had indicated is that we did raise prices in many of our flash products as a result of NAND prices increasing to us. And so in many cases, we did pass that along. The only seasonality you will see in gross margin relates sometimes to Q2 on a product basis. We see year end public sector revenue and margin go up. Otherwise, it’s not that cyclical. I would hesitate to give a long-term guide on product margin. It is certainly our intent and I mentioned this at the Analyst Day that we should be doing better than we are and that is part of our AOP, or annual operating plan, for FY ‘18. Simona Jankowski Thank you. Kris Newton Thanks Simona. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Maynard Um Hi. Thanks. Can you just talk about the change in your go-to-market that you talked about at your Analyst Day, how much have you done and any qualitative or quantitative thoughts you can share on what you are seeing. And then similarly, with the compensation structure changes, have you seen any disruptions or any kind of turnover in sales that have been outside the norm? Thanks. George Kurian I think first of all, the confidence in our employees, customers and reseller partners is exceptionally good. I think the turnaround has been seen positively by everybody and we are attracting the world’s best talent to NetApp. I think in terms of the compensation plan, the coverage model and some of the things that we talked about at the Financial Analyst Day, we recently implemented that at the start of May, which is the plan for the new fiscal year, fiscal ‘18. And so we are going to play that out through the course of this year. I think we entered the year with a really strong capacity number in terms of quota bearing heads, which is what we had said that as part of transformation, we are going to redeploy investments from non-quota bearing roles to quota bearing roles and we feel really good. The momentum in the product portfolio demonstrated market share gains and the right amount of capacity to execute our game plan for this year. And as I mentioned, we intend to grow product revenue year-on-year this year, accelerating through the course of the year. Maynard Um Great. Thank you. Kris Newton Thank you, Maynard. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Alex Kurtz Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I apologize if you have already touched on this, but when you look at your all-flash growth, can you help us quantify how much of that’s coming from the installed base refresh over maybe the last nine months or so and how much of that is net new customer growth? George Kurian We are gaining new customers, new workloads and existing customers. And the two of them are represented by the fact that we are based on public market data from IDC, for example, the fastest growing major SAN vendor, fiber channel storage vendor, which is a net new market for NetApp. We have converted a small percentage, as I mentioned less than 10% of our install base to all-flash arrays. So the majority of our growth is coming from outside our installed base. Alex Kurtz Okay, alright. Thank you. Kris Newton Thank you, Alex. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox Thanks. Good afternoon. I am just a little confused on the gross margin guidance, so you are talking about doing 62% to 63% in the first quarter and then also for the full year even though you are talking about accelerating sales growth, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes between Q1 and say the full year guidance? Thanks. Ron Pasek I mean so we generally see Q1 as fairly flat to Q4. We have a little higher mix of services revenues, which usually helps gross margin. However, we do have NAND costs still increasing, so that’s a little bit of a headwind. As I mentioned at Analyst Day, I think that will start to dissipate later in the year and certainly into next year. We are maintaining a fairly conservative range for the year, where we are trying some new things with compensation in the sales force. And we want to see them take hold. We will see how that goes. I think it can only be upside. Steven Fox Great. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Mark Kelleher Great. Thanks for taking the question. You talked about reinvigorating your OEM program, can you maybe talk a little bit about what your plans are there? George Kurian I think it’s too early to comment. I think we do see the opportunity to access new markets and new geographies using both software as well as hardware. So we have succeeded in some of the smart city projects that are going on in Asia Pacific – in the Asia Pacific region, using a new type of integrator that combines NetApp storage with other components of a broad based smart city solution. That’s one example. We will communicate more through the course of the year as news becomes available. But in the broad context, the combination of software assets from NetApp, like ONTAP Select or SolidFire software as well as the opportunity to create new solutions through new pathways makes us believe that OEM is no longer a place which declines, but rather flattens out or starts to grow moderately. Mark Kelleher Okay. Thanks. Kris Newton Thanks Mark. Next question? Operator And our next question comes from the line of Jim Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is now open. James Kisner That’s James, not Jim, to make sure. So on the – just a quick clarification, my next sort of question, on – you mentioned, I think the excess and obviously the inventory helping product margin, I want to make sure that that was still up, helping non-GAAP product margin and maybe you could quantify how much that helped. And then just separately, on just the – congrats on the minus 7% better mature solutions declines, are there any particular pieces in that business that outperformed that really helped you with that, I guess, you said differently, what’s the product line that did the best year-over-year that drove that result? Thanks. Ron Pasek So on the – I was really trying to point out is we had that as a headwind in Q3. It certainly wasn’t there in Q4. The main pieces of benefit were of course better sales execution and the removal of the promo for cDOT. George Kurian I think with regard to the mature solutions, I think first of all, we had said that as – the three components of mature solutions were add-on storage, OEM and 7-Mode. And they are increasingly becoming a smaller part of our overall business. So the year-on-year declines in them are frankly, smaller than they would be. The preponderant majority of that business is OEM and add-on storage at this point. And therefore, those will not be, as I said subject to the same rate of declines. 7-Mode is now a much, much smaller percentage of our business. If you think about the shipments out of the factory, they are 95% clustered ONTAP. And so we think that mature overall, as we had said many times, will be a place of stability or modest – very modest decline going forward. James Kisner Thanks very much. Kris Newton Thank you, James. Next question? Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. David Ryzhik Hi. Thanks so much. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini. Your anticipation for accelerating product growth throughout the year, does that include new products such as hyper-converged ramping. And the second part of my question is regarding cDOT migration, what is the strategy with legacy 7-Mode installations given that you are kind of signaling that your – that it’s behind us, what is the strategy, if any? Thanks. Ron Pasek So with respect to ramp of new products yes, in fact SolidFire continues to ramp in the year and some other new products that will come along. George Kurian So we feel good about the portfolio we have to-date that have – we have just finished a very strong quarter. We think that many of the solutions that we saw this quarter have expanded potential and we will continue to demonstrate additive innovations to the portfolio over the course of the year, stay tuned. With regard to the customer base and the partner channel on clustered ONTAP, we have migrated a substantial percentage of that customer base as we have communicated, 2 clustering from 7-Mode. We have also trained our partner channel and trained our customers to achieve those migrations themselves. So we have given them tools, methodologies and allowed them to shadow us as we help them do the migrations. The remainder of those migrations will happen at the pace that customers take on IT projects. They will be a part of the broader IT agenda of customers. And so we feel very good. We have got the big percentage of our installed base migrated. We have seen real success with both clustered ONTAP and all-flash clustered ONTAP, called All Flash FAS and we think that we have established a compelling value proposition for customers to migrate over the remainder of the installed base. David Ryzhik Great. Thank you. Kris Newton Thank you. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Srini Nandury with Summit Redstone. Your line is now open. Srini Nandury Alright. Thank you for taking my questions. Congratulations on a good quarter. You mentioned on the call that you are taking out EMC once a day. What products are you displacing? Are those primarily Dell products or EMC or both? George Kurian We are displacing the EMC products, primarily VMAXs and VNXs as we tear out old SAN environments and replace them with All Flash FAS. We are also looking forward to displacing old Isilon environments with ONTAP 9.2. So we... Srini Nandury Alright. Thank you, George. Kris Newton Thank you, Srini. Next question? Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Katy Huberty Thanks. Good afternoon. Ron, how should we think about operating expense trend for the full year fiscal ‘18 in light of R&D for adjacent markets and some of the go-to-market investments you talked about at the Analyst Day? Ron Pasek Yes. So what I mentioned at Analyst Day for the 3-year period, it would be roughly flat. I also mentioned we would see a slight bump in ‘18 as we will see given we need to give people raises. But other than that, it’s really pretty much flat to what we would have expected. Just to clarify one additional thing, Katy, what we are clear was that we are just continuing to do transformation that we would be using that as a tool to disinvest and reinvest in the business so that the reinvestment is not all incremental. Kris Newton Thanks, Katy. Next question? Operator And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani Thanks a lot, guys. I guess just a question on the component shortages. And maybe I missed this, but could you quantify what headwind did component shortages or price increases have for you in the April quarter and how do you think of that headwind in July? And if I understand the structure of your – securing the NAND supply dynamic properly, is it fair to think you have secured the supply, but pricing could still fluctuate and still could have a margin impact? Ron Pasek That’s right. I was hinting at that last quarter. We do secure the supply for the remainder of the calendar year, but we only do pricing for the next 90 days in advance. So it was about 1 point headwind in the Q4 quarter. It was about 0.5 point as we enter Q1. Kris Newton Alright. Thanks, Amit. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Rod Hall Yes, thanks for the question. I just wanted to check on the competitive dynamic, a couple of questions actually on this. One is Dell/EMC significantly increased their channel program at the beginning of the year, especially focused on storage. So I wonder if you could comment on whether you have seen any impacts from that and just kind of how that’s playing out in the market? And then I also wanted to talk a little about these price increases. Do you expect others to do the same? And what do you think the impact on market demand is going to be, your customers going to pause spending as we get toward the back end of this year as they think about NAND eventually clearing and pricing coming back down or do you think people will keep that ongoing? And then lastly, on NAND, I just want to ask that again. I mean, the data points in the quarter suggest that stabilization is not going to happen in the back end of this year as people have thought. Most – at least some of the suppliers are now pushing out supply/demand breakeven into middle or even into next year. So I wonder if you are thinking that things are going to stabilize at the end of the year. Maybe it’s a little bit optimistic. I would just like to get your comments on that. George Kurian Okay, that’s a lot of questions, but let me take them in sequence. With regard to EMC channel programs, we have a strong group of channel partners that do a lot of business with NetApp that are focused on NetApp. I think the success of our All Flash FAS products, the success of our competitive programs, the success of FlexPod in an all-flash configuration are all indications of the strength of our channels and the focus that we have. I think EMC may sweep up some of the marginal partners, but they are not the core focus of our channel program. The second is with regard to the pricing dynamics in customers, we are uniquely positioned with clustered ONTAP to enable customers to move workloads between an all-flash configuration and a hybrid flash configuration that combines flash with disk seamlessly. So, we are able to provide customers a choice of both. We did see strength in our hybrid flash platforms this quarter as well, but it’s too early to tell whether that was a reflection of pricing. It would be remiss of me to speculate on what other people would do. I think we felt that it was important for us to stay consistent to prior practice and future practice that we pass through to customers the increases in component costs as well as the decreases in component cost as they happen. Ron Pasek And then with respect to NAND supply, remember, we have strategic relationships with suppliers that allow us and afford us different dynamics than perhaps other people in the marketplace. So what I said today and previously are still consistent. So, we see our supply being in good shape and should free up later in the year and into next year. Rod Hall Okay, thank you. Kris Newton Thanks, Rod. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is now open. Nehal Chokshi Thank you. The driver on the pullback of the year-over-year growth for the July quarter, I mean, you had 7% year-over-year growth for the April quarter and you are guiding at a midpoint of 2%. Is there a story behind why you are guiding for that pullback on that growth? And I do have a follow-up as well. Ron Pasek Nothing other than what we indicated at the Analyst Day. So, we really are giving realistic and in some cases conservative estimates and we want to make sure we meet or beat every commitment we made, as we have the last four quarters. Nehal Chokshi Okay. Is it possible that the year ago comps is a lot easier than it was for the April quarter and that’s one of the things that’s going into that conservatism as well? Ron Pasek Actually, the year ago Q1 – Q1 of ‘17 was actually a pretty good quarter. It really was flat for product revenue. It was down slightly on services only, because we had a 13-week quarter versus 14 the year before. So, if anything, it’s a more difficult compare. Nehal Chokshi That’s what I meant, okay, sorry. And then my follow-up is that it looks like revenue from direct pathways took a step back in terms of the year-over-year growth profile while indirect accelerated. So, is there a story behind what seems to be two different tales for these two different pathways for market? George Kurian No, nothing substantive there. I think it’s just mix and transactions, timing of transactions. I don’t think there is anything systematic. I think we have had a good progress with our channel partners and we have seen strength in terms of total product revenue growth across both. FlexPod, in particular, we had a really strong year and second half of the year in particular with FlexPod through the FlexPod Advantage and All Flash FAS programs. So I would say that it probably reflects more the strength of the indirect channel through that model. Nehal Chokshi Okay, thank you. Kris Newton Thank you, Nehal. Next question? Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Simon Leopold Great, thank you. First, I just wanted to clarify within the guidance, I think it seems to imply your operating expenses rise sequentially. And just looking at prior years, sales and marketing sometimes moves up, sometimes moves down on what is typically a seasonally lower revenue quarter. Could you help us understand any of the moving parts that might be influencing OpEx in your July guidance? And then in terms of the broader question, I wanted to ask about the longer term strategy in terms of all flash because you’ve got hyper-converged product coming to market in three different all flash platforms. Is there some thought about trying to consolidate those platforms or looking for more synergies or are there synergies there and just not well appreciated? Thank you. Ron Pasek Yes. So on the walk on OpEx from Q4 to Q1, it’s simply the fact that we are giving people raises. We are down in Q1 ‘18 versus Q1 a year ago. And again, we are doing some disinvestments and reinvestments. So that is the really simple explanation. That’s it. George Kurian With regard to your second question, I would say we had very clear swim lanes and use cases that we described for our all-flash array platforms. And that allows customers to make ongoing purchase decisions with confidence in these roadmaps. With regard to offerings of both ONTAP and SolidFire, I would just tell you we have had a tradition of making ONTAP and SolidFire available as standalone systems as part of converged infrastructure, software and as a service model. And what you will see with SolidFire is its offering in a hyper-converged form factor. So it’s consistent with practice. Our customers like the fact that they can operate a storage environment across all of these use cases. It gives them a huge return on both training as well as automation and management and monitoring infrastructure, unlike our competitors who have a different operating system for every single use case. Simon Leopold Great. Thank you. That’s very helpful. Kris Newton Thanks Simon. Next question? Operator And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open. Mark Moskowitz Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just want to build off of Rod’s question from earlier regarding competitive dynamics, it seems like it could be more than just Dell EMC if we are not mistaken in terms of Pure Storage starting to gain momentum of FlashBlade and also HP Enterprise acquiring Nimble, it just seems like NetApp now is in the crosshairs of a lot of different targets, you are a bull’s eye of some of these other players out there, is this part of the reason why you are being a little more cautious on the guide and not really providing a full year revenue outlook, because you could have a lot more vectors hurting you? George Kurian Not at all, I think we feel real confident, right. If you look at the strategic portfolio, it accelerated through the year both in terms of its size as a percentage of our business as well as growth rates. Just take a look, last quarter, it was up 22% on product revenue; strategic product revenue this quarter, 24%. Last year, it was 14% at this time. So we feel real good about the product portfolio. I think it’s – there is two things, right. I think one is we want to make sure that when we give you guidance, we can achieve those estimates and it’s really that. And then the second is we continue to watch the macro. And as we get more color through the course of the year, we will certainly give you a better outlook as it becomes available. But it has got nothing to do with competitive dynamics. If you look at our market share numbers in all-flash arrays, we are outpacing all these guys. I would tell you that some of the competitor moves are desperation moves to catch us rather than us feeling worried about them. Kris Newton Thank you, Mark. Next question? Operator And our next question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Your line is now open. Eric Martinuzzi Yes. I may have missed this earlier, but what was the headcount – what did you finish the headcount with for FY ‘17 and what’s your expectation for headcount for FY – sorry, finish for FY ‘17 and your expectation for FY ‘18? Ron Pasek So we do not plan to add any net new headcount in FY ‘18. We finished the year at 10,103 employees. Eric Martinuzzi Got it. Thanks. Kris Newton Thanks Eric. Next question? Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP. Your line is now open. Erik Suppiger Yes. Can you just expand on the Plexistor acquisition, how big was that? George Kurian It’s a small number of employees. It is factored into the operating margin guidance that we gave you. So it will not be dilutive to operating margins. And at this point, we are not disclosing the terms of the transaction. Erik Suppiger Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton Thanks Erik. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Jim Suva Thank you very much. Maybe I am doing my math wrong or something, but can you help me out, is your EPS guidance range bigger now than it has been historically in the past and if my math is correct, can you help us understand why bigger range? Ron Pasek Yes. What we did last year was had a bigger range to revenue, but it wasn’t mirrored in EPS. So all I did was make them equal, so that it’s more in line with the broader range we had established for revenue. Jim Suva Got it. Thank you so much. Operator Thank you. And your next question comes from John Lucia with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. John Lucia Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify on the revenue growth acceleration throughout FY ‘18, is that total revenue, product revenue or both? Ron Pasek Both. John Lucia Okay. And just to be clear again, you are expecting acceleration every single quarter so that Q4 has the highest growth rate, correct? Ron Pasek That would be our – well, not necessarily growth rate, but it would have our highest – it would be our highest revenue quarter for the year and that would be our traditional seasonal pattern, yes. John Lucia Okay. And then with respect to the NAND supply, you said that NetApp is well positioned because you have the ability to sell the hybrid and bring the price down given the HCD components, are customers really adjusting their purchasing decisions, because of a slightly – a slight price increase, it seems like if a customer settles on an all-flash solution, it’s kind of a long-term strategic decision that wouldn’t be influenced or changed to go to a hybrid solution by short-term pricing increases, so if you could elaborate on that, that would be helpful? George Kurian Yes. Flash still has – even with an increase in the cost of an SSD on $1 per gigabyte basis, flash still has compelling advantages from a total cost of ownership, right, density, power consumption, operational benefits. So there is a lot of other reasons why people would continue to choose flash. I think what we find is, we continued to have this benefit that when we position our solution to customers, they can buy into an architecture that ensures them against material moves in the price, right. Unlike our competitors who only have an all-flash storage system, we can go ahead and tell a customer, buy our clustered ONTAP architecture. And you know what, if the price of flash goes up substantially for a period of time, you can deployed a disk-based solution or a hybrid solution for those discretionary workloads that absolutely do not need an all-flash environment, right. And that’s really how we position it. Flash continues to have material advantages over disk from a total cost of ownership perspective. That needs to be factored into the calculations. John Lucia Okay. Thank you very much. Kris Newton Thanks John. Next question? Operator Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan Yes. Thanks. Ron, sorry if I missed this, but can you just comment on the OpEx seasonality through the course of the year? Thanks. Ron Pasek Yes. I mean as I said, we see a little bump up in Q1 simply because we are giving people raises. Absent that, what you tend to see is it follow essentially variable comp, which would be higher in the second half of the year and that’s really about it. Again, we are in a net zero headcount growth environment, so you shouldn’t see any growth in headcount causing any cyclicality in OpEx. Wamsi Mohan Okay. Thanks. Kris Newton Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Wamsi. I will turn it back to George for closing comments. George Kurian Thanks Kris. We successfully completed the first phase of our transformation. We delivered against all our commitments for fiscal year ‘17 and returned the company to growth with expanded earnings growth. We are well positioned for sustained growth going forward. The majority of our systems business is in the high growth all-flash array market and the market is in the early days of the shift from disk to flash. Our compelling hyper-converged infrastructure solution will leapfrog the first generation HCI products by bringing HCI to the enterprise with cloud integration and the ability to run multiple workloads on a shared infrastructure. And we continue to expand our opportunity through organic and inorganic innovation. Entering the next phase of our transformation, we will focus on three priorities; expanding our opportunity with continued emphasis on the growth areas of the market, the way we deliver our solutions and reaching new buyers, making fundamental changes to enable reinvestment in the business while continuing to drive the expansion of our operating margins, as we have demonstrated this year and continuing our robust and balanced capital allocation program. Thank you to all our partners and shareholders for supporting us during this period of transition. And I want to say a special thank you to the NetApp team for leading into transformation and accelerating our turnaround. I am proud of our progress and especially of you, our world class team. I look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference call. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect.

Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Nuance's Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there'll be an opportunity for your questions, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. With us today from Nuance are Chairman and CEO, Paul Ricci; CFO, Dan Tempesta; EVP of Corporate Strategy and Development, Bruce Bowden; and Director of Investor Relations, Christine Marchuska. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Marchuska. Please go ahead. Christine Marchuska - Nuance Communications, Inc. Thank you. Before we begin, I remind, everyone, our discussion this afternoon includes predictions, estimates, expectations, and other forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause material differences in our actual results. Please refer to our recent SEC filings for a discussion of these risks. All references to income statement results are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated, and as noted in our press release, we issued a set of prepared remarks in advance of this call, which are available on our website. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments and we will not repeat them here. I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Good afternoon, everyone. Before taking your questions, I'd like to address several highlights from our earnings report. We continued our momentum from the first fiscal quarter to deliver robust results in the second quarter across all of our financial metrics. Net new bookings grew more than 30% year-over-year, sustaining our overperformance of bookings in the first quarter of 2017. We reported non-GAAP revenue of $511.1 million and of particular note, returned to organic revenue growth. Importantly, our recurring revenues achieved 75% in the quarter, up 300 basis points from the same quarter last year, and cloud and hosting revenues reached 40% of total revenues in the quarter. Our gross margins and operating margins exceeded our internal expectations owing to our revenue performance and continued focus on expense management and productivity. EPS is $0.43, exceeded our guidance, reflecting our revenue performance and cost discipline. Finally, cash flows remained strong at $125.4 million. In summary, we're pleased with the financial performance for the second quarter and the first half of the fiscal year. In addition to our financial results, we're especially pleased with the robust pipeline for our advanced solutions, including our Enterprise omni-channel offerings, which use conversational artificial intelligence to deliver superior customer service. The demand among automotive manufactures for our AI capabilities remains unabated. In the pipeline for our Dragon Medical cloud solutions now augmented with real-time analytics to support the physician, continues to be exceptionally strong. Overall, the increased adoption of these advanced offerings in key verticals and the continued demand for our domain expertise contributed to another robust net new bookings quarter, and provided a very full pipeline for the second half of the year. Therefore, we are raising our guidance for net new bookings growth from the previous target range of 2% to 6% for the full-year FY 2017 to a revised range of 6% to 10%. Based on our revenue performance for the first half and the increased composition of recurring revenues. We've also raised the midpoint of our full-year revenue guidance. This improved bookings and revenue guidance is based on confidence in our sustained performance, including our expectations as we noted in our comments last quarter that our Healthcare and Mobile segments have the potential for overperformance for the full fiscal year, offset in part by a continuation of the sluggish results we've seen in Imaging year-to-date. Margin and earnings in our first two quarters also benefited from expense discipline and our ongoing focus on our transformation program. Although some of the benefits of this discipline will carry into the second half, we should note that our overperformance in bookings this fiscal year carries with it additional sales and commission of expenses of about $0.02 per share. Additionally, we will need to materially increase our head count in our Automotive business in the second half to serve the robust Automotive bookings this year and to ensure that we can serve our customer commitments and address the pipeline of opportunities for fiscal year 2018. We're also adding expenses in this half, such as cloud infrastructure, which will allow us to achieve additional transformation savings in FY 2018. In closing, let me comment that we will continue our transformation program throughout the remainder of fiscal 2017 and into fiscal 2018 with the twin goals of improving our efficiency and redirecting expenditures towards our highest growth businesses. As we've indicated previously, we expect to reinvest most of these ongoing savings towards further growth in order to sustain our organic growth this year and to further improve our growth rate in FY 2018, as we previously guided. With that we'd be pleased to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. And our first question will come from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Go ahead, please. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Paul, in the prepared remarks you talked a bit about strength in a few different Enterprise product categories. But clearly, it's been the segment that's had the strongest organic growth really now for four more quarters. And I guess, maybe if you can dig into some of the detail of what the demand drivers there are and how sustainable you think this level of organic growth could be? And then a quick financial question on the guidance. I think for the full year you indicated CapEx of $50 million to $60 million, which is a bit back half weighted. And so I guess my question is, is that conservatism or is that also part of the spending in Auto or elsewhere to support some of the growth that you expect in 2018? Thanks. Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Okay. With respect to the Enterprise question first, what's driving the performance in our Enterprise business is a combination of our differentiation in self-service and the breadth of our vision in serving omni-channel solutions. I think that is a durable differentiation for us. And I think it's serving a durable demand. We're seeing success across the product line, including our on-premise solutions, our voice biometrics solutions, and our digital omni-channel cloud solutions. Customers are going through a transformation of their customer service operations to fully embrace this omni-channel vision, and we're in the early innings of that vision. So I think the opportunity in the market remains large, and our position is distinct. So I think it is a sustainable opportunity for us. With respect to the capital question, I think it's a reasonable estimate for the amount of capital expenditures this year. Capital expenditures may pick-up a bit in the second half, including investments in our cloud infrastructure for fiscal 2018, very important. And investments in some – process automation investments that we're also making. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. And, Dan, if I read correctly, so that the change in the accrued non-GAAP tax rate has no impact on cash flow from operations. So even though the guidance for cash flow from ops as a percentage of non-GAAP net income is higher, the actual guidance for cash flow from operations is similar or the same? Is that the right way to think about it? Daniel David Tempesta - Nuance Communications, Inc. Yes. That's actually, Tavis, that's a good way to think about it. So but since you asked and I assume others may have questions as well, let me take this opportunity to address the question more broadly. So beginning in the quarter, we are changing our method of calculating our non-GAAP tax provision, while it will impact the reported non-GAAP net income and earnings per share. I do want to stress the point you just raised that there'll be no change in the cash or tax economics of the business. So, historically, we have utilized a cash tax method to derive our non-GAAP earnings. We felt this approach best informed investors of our tax economics, given our large U.S. NOLs, and the fact that we have not been a U.S. federal tax payer because of these NOLs. Now, based on the most recent interpretations from the SEC, we will show a non-GAAP tax provision that is based on our non-GAAP profits. So effectively, we'll be adding back any non-tax – any tax effect from the non-GAAP adjustments, and we will also assume, we will enjoy the – not enjoy the benefits of the NOLs. So, this approach will result in a higher tax rate in our non-GAAP earnings. For example, under the approach, the new approach will have approximately 31% in 2017, and that compares to a tax rate of 5% to 6% under the old cash tax rate. So, we've incorporated some of these tables in the prepared remarks to help you understand that. And as we look forward over the next three years, we would assume a 31% tax rate under the new method and a rate of 6% to 7% on a cash tax basis. So a little bit higher than the 5% to 6% that we've reported historically, due to some additional revenue that we've been talking about in Brazil and in China as well, but still a 6% to 7% over the foreseeable future. And the last... Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Sorry, can you remind me what the actual dollar amount of the tax loss carryforward is at present? Daniel David Tempesta - Nuance Communications, Inc. Sure, at the end of 2016, it was around $630 million. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thanks. Daniel David Tempesta - Nuance Communications, Inc. And then, the last thing I'll mention is, we're going to keep on reporting cash taxes on a supplemental basis. So, we're not going to include that, in the actual earnings calculation in the net income calculation. We will include that in the narrative, because there are a number of analysts and investors that use that in their models. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Ian Strgar with UBS. Please, go ahead. Ian Strgar - UBS Securities LLC Hey, guys thanks for taking my questions. Paul, can you update us on how the search for a new CEO is going, for when you're retiring, I believe in early 2018? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Yes, the board has formed a search committee, and it's really only in its preliminary activity, so we have no significant progress to report, but we will keep you appraised as the board complete this work. Ian Strgar - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Got it. And operating margins came in really strong for the quarter, can you maybe just elaborate a little bit on what led to being able to get over 30% operating margins? And then, maybe would you give us what you think your long-term target for where Nuance can get for operating margins in 2018 and beyond? I mean is this some mid-30s% operating margin business over the long-term? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Let's see, a couple of questions, let me take them in turn. Our operating margins enjoyed the benefit of some overachievement in our gross margins, the benefit, of course, of our overachievement in revenues, and good cost discipline up and down our operating expense lines. The second part of your question, what we have said previously is that, first, we expect margins to be in the range of 28% to 29% this year. We've confirmed that in today's comments. And we've previously suggested that we'll see a modest increase in operating margins as we look ahead to next year. Reminding investors that we have significant cost savings engineered into our business in 2017 and in 2018. But that it is our intention to direct the preponderance of those savings towards growth opportunities with the goal of continuing to lift our organic growth rate in 2018 and then again in 2019. So I think you should think of it as modest margin improvement as we look ahead over the next three years with focus on improving the top line and growth. Ian Strgar - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Got it. And if I could just squeeze one more in, the sales reorg in Imaging, can you guys just talk about where that's at? And how quickly we might expect the growth rates in Imaging to bounce back? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Well, they've done a lot of work in Imaging during the second quarter. It made a lot of progress. I think we're going to see the benefits of that progress in the second half. Revenues could be relatively flat in the second half, and bookings performance, I believe, will look up from where it's been in the first half. So I think we've turned a corner. But it will take some time to work the effect of those changes through the system. So I think this is a year in which we should expect to see the remediation with the goal of stabilization and setting up for growth next year based on additional sales investments we're making over the second half of this year and product investments we're also making in the business over the second half of this year. Ian Strgar - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for the color, guys. I appreciate it. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead. Josh Baer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. This is Josh on for Sanjit. You talked about a material increase in head count in Automotive. Wondering if you could expand a little more on where you're investing there? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. We're investing significantly in our services – Automotive services organization in order to fulfill on the bookings that we've seen in the later half of 2016 and have seen in 2017 and expect to see – continue to see throughout 2017. We simply have to – we simply have a greater – need a greater capacity in our Automotive business to serve customer obligations that we've been fortunate enough to win. We're also investing in R&D to accelerate the evolution of the Automotive product plan, in the desire to serve the vision we have of the connected car in 2020. Josh Baer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. And when you talk about a return to growth in FY 2018 in Healthcare segment, is that on a reported or organic basis? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. We're referring to organic. Josh Baer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. We'll go next to Nandan Amladi with Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead. Nandan G. Amladi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thanks for taking my question. So, Paul, what has changed in the quality and the close rates of the pipeline relative to sort of this time last year, when bookings have been a lot softer? Is it that the demand environment has changed? Is it that your product is now more competitive? Can you characterize what might be helping that? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Well, with as varied a set of markets as we have, one would have to answer that question specifically in each market. But I think if we try to look generally across the company, I think that the overall interest in the kind of intelligence solutions we build, has grown as visibility around the opportunity and the potential of those solutions, has increased. I think our investments in our go-to-market approaches, beginning in the latter half of last year, has paid dividend for us. And I do think our product investments are allowing us to effectively target opportunities, a good example of that, of course, would be the robust perception around Dragon Medical One, which has only been in the market for, I think, 15 months – 12 months to 18 months now. Nandan G. Amladi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. And the sort of related question, specific to Healthcare. As you look at the product mix that you're selling today, how much of the contribution is coming from new products on the Clintegrity and CDI side relative to, are you just mentioned Dragon Medical has had the pretty strong uptick. So if you think about new versus upsell into the base, what does that mix look like today versus a year ago? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. I don't have a precise number for what the relative contribution of new versus installed of existing customer is compared to a year ago, I apologize, I do know that we're doing quite well in cultivating new customers in that business. And I think that's part of what's contributing to the quality of the pipeline we have in Healthcare, which although I had not commented on specifically is really extraordinary pipeline right now for us. Nandan G. Amladi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. Please, go ahead. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Great. Thanks for taking my question. Paul, as it relates to, I guess start with the Auto side, obviously, you're working on your models, but just any changes in win rates at this point? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. No. We've been very fortunate and customer support for our solutions, and we win a very strong majority of solutions and that has been true for some time and continues to be so. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC And then with respect to Dragon, how far are we – I think you suggested in the commentary we're kind of through the bulk of this transition to a recurring model from new sales? I'm just curious specific to the installed premise customers, what kind of dataset have you built so far in terms of being able to convert them from maintenance payers to actually full-paying subscription users on the new offering? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. I don't have the percentage of that at the top of my head. We – I think our comments were meant to suggest that the downward pressure on revenues from the Dragon transition is significantly behind us, it's mostly behind us at this point. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Okay. And then I guess lastly on the handset side. It sounded as though that is one of the areas where you're calling out the declines are over, or at least the worse of them are over. Can you just talk about both the rev rec and the sequential improvement in revenues there? And then also bookings, just a little bit of an overview on what's going on the Auto or the handset space? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Well, of course the Mobile numbers we published are composite of the Automotive, handset and smartphone and IoT and the mobile operators segment. And the handset, the smartphone business is in decline as we've discussed now for some time and we expect that particular sub-segment to continue to decline. It is going to be offset by the growth of IoT opportunities we've mentioned such as smart home, but that's a relatively small business today, but the performance of that business has been driven by the other two sub-segments, Automotive and mobile operators. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Right. Understood. And then, lastly, Paul, any even modest tweaks at the edges in terms of likely uses of capital? You're obviously generating some great cash flows here and getting better. Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. No. I think, we've indicated in over several quarters now that we have a balanced agenda of share buybacks, debt reduction, and modest acquisitions. And I think, that remains our approach. Daniel David Tempesta - Nuance Communications, Inc. Hey Jeff, let me just remind you too. We did – with the recent convert we did, we raised – we bought back $100 million, which matched our plan for the year. And with the capital – the earlier capital transactions, we will have – once we settle the convert that's due in November, we would have taken down our debt balances by about $150 million. So that really is supporting what we've talked about. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please, go ahead. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. I joined a few minutes late, so apologies if these were already asked. Maybe first for you, Dan, in the prepared remarks we called out the Cablevision and Roku wins in the quarter. Can you talk to whether those benefited the Mobile business or Mobile revenues at all here in the second quarter? And just maybe broadly speaking, can you remind us how the revenue models for these types of customers in that smart home vertical work mechanically? Daniel David Tempesta - Nuance Communications, Inc. Sure. I think those two were just bookings, and they didn't contribute to the revenues this quarter. The smart home can work in a number of ways. It can work with an active user per month. And so if a person uses the system, then we'll get paid per month for that usage. It can work on a per device approach. So but it's usually transactional based on usage. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe for my follow-up for you, Paul. Paul, you mentioned in response to another question the strong performance in Dragon Medical One. We certainly see it in the bookings commentary in Healthcare. Can you just talk qualitatively about where this is coming from? I mean we've got such dominant share in that vertical – in that market. So is the success with Dragon Medical One coming from winning new customers, is it taking share, maybe upgrading existing customers? How do you think about the robust performance there? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. I think we are converting existing customers around a broader vision of integrated clinical documentation based on cloud platform. I think we are winning new customers, some of whom are competitive customers. And I think we are expanding more successfully into the middle market. I think it's a combination of those three things. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc. Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks very much, guys. Operator Thank you. We now have a question from Tom Roderick with Stifel. Please, go ahead. Tom Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hey, guys. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. So, Paul, I've got a two-part question for you here related to acquisitions. The first year, can you just help us understand what sort of contributions TouchCommerce is having on the Enterprise business there? I mean, it looks like the organic growth has been great, both with and without TouchCommerce over the last four quarters. I know you've only had them for a few quarters of that. So talk about how that's impacting the numbers? And then if you wouldn't mind giving us a sense of sort of what to expect in that segment organically as you lap that? I know the comps will get tougher. And then the second part of the question here is, it looks like there's a $50 million use of cash for acquisitions in the quarter. I think the mCarbon Tech deal was reported back in February. Can you talk a little bit about what you got there? And how you expect that to contribute to the business for the remainder of this year? Thanks. Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Last year when we bought TouchCommerce, I believe we gave an indication that TouchCommerce would contribute about $70 million in this year's financial plan. And it is on target to achieve that number. And so that's a reasonable number for you to work with. I think the mCarbon contribution over the course of this year is immaterial. Tom Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Daniel David Tempesta - Nuance Communications, Inc. Yes. And the $50 million that you related to is not related to mCarbon, it was – mCarbon was a small piece of that. We also did a purchase of some IP. Tom Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Perfect. Okay. That's helpful. A much bigger picture question here for you, Paul, as you think about the Automotive segment. I know it's much too early to expect any contribution to that business from the autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicle segment. But how do you think about how you want to see the business invest in that opportunity over the next 12 months to 24 months? Do you think about that as a big opportunity for Nuance if you look out three years to five years? Or is it too early to even consider making investments on the R&D side there? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Well, it's not our plan to join a very crowded field in the technologies associated directly with autonomous driving. But the automotive manufacturers, as you know, see a transformation going on in the vision of the automobile in the near to medium future that includes a far more robust connected car, in part to enjoy the benefits of more autonomous driving. And we do participate in that vision of a connected car and that, I think, relates to the investments I was referring to earlier. We're doing very well in that business and it remains a major focus of growth for us as we look out over the three-year horizon. Tom Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Excellent. Thank you for the detail. Appreciate it. Operator Thank you. And, our final question will come from David Hynes with Canaccord. Go ahead, please. David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Yeah. Hey. Thanks. Just one from me. Paul, you outlined some of the reactive expense growth, right, commission support infrastructure. The business has really been kind of in expense management mode here for the last couple of years, curious kind of what the – with the improved bookings growth environment and I'm sure, you're going to start thinking about budgeting for 2018 soon? I mean, does this at all change kind of how you're thinking about maybe proactive spends, growth investments to kind of sustain what we're seeing? Or do you think you can kind of keep up with the bookings growth guidance, kind of, at the expense levels that you're running the business now? How are you thinking about that longer term? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Yeah. It's a good question and we were careful in our prepared remarks and reiterated in my opening comments that we are having to lay expenses into the business to ensure that we take advantage of the opportunities that are in front of us. And our strength in our bookings performance only confirms for us the wisdom of pursuing those investments. And we said earlier this year that we were going to pursue growth investments and that if we saw positive reinforcement from that, that we would continue to do that and that is the plan we're on. David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator Okay. Thank you. Please, go ahead with any closing remarks. Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Okay.

And our first question will come from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Go ahead, please. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Paul, in the prepared remarks you talked a bit about strength in a few different Enterprise product categories. But clearly, it's been the segment that's had the strongest organic growth really now for four more quarters. And I guess, maybe if you can dig into some of the detail of what the demand drivers there are and how sustainable you think this level of organic growth could be? And then a quick financial question on the guidance. I think for the full year you indicated CapEx of $50 million to $60 million, which is a bit back half weighted. And so I guess my question is, is that conservatism or is that also part of the spending in Auto or elsewhere to support some of the growth that you expect in 2018? Thanks. Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Okay. With respect to the Enterprise question first, what's driving the performance in our Enterprise business is a combination of our differentiation in self-service and the breadth of our vision in serving omni-channel solutions. I think that is a durable differentiation for us. And I think it's serving a durable demand. We're seeing success across the product line, including our on-premise solutions, our voice biometrics solutions, and our digital omni-channel cloud solutions. Customers are going through a transformation of their customer service operations to fully embrace this omni-channel vision, and we're in the early innings of that vision. So I think the opportunity in the market remains large, and our position is distinct. So I think it is a sustainable opportunity for us. With respect to the capital question, I think it's a reasonable estimate for the amount of capital expenditures this year. Capital expenditures may pick-up a bit in the second half, including investments in our cloud infrastructure for fiscal 2018, very important. And investments in some – process automation investments that we're also making. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. And, Dan, if I read correctly, so that the change in the accrued non-GAAP tax rate has no impact on cash flow from operations. So even though the guidance for cash flow from ops as a percentage of non-GAAP net income is higher, the actual guidance for cash flow from operations is similar or the same? Is that the right way to think about it? Daniel David Tempesta - Nuance Communications, Inc. Yes. That's actually, Tavis, that's a good way to think about it. So but since you asked and I assume others may have questions as well, let me take this opportunity to address the question more broadly. So beginning in the quarter, we are changing our method of calculating our non-GAAP tax provision, while it will impact the reported non-GAAP net income and earnings per share. I do want to stress the point you just raised that there'll be no change in the cash or tax economics of the business. So, historically, we have utilized a cash tax method to derive our non-GAAP earnings. We felt this approach best informed investors of our tax economics, given our large U.S. NOLs, and the fact that we have not been a U.S. federal tax payer because of these NOLs. Now, based on the most recent interpretations from the SEC, we will show a non-GAAP tax provision that is based on our non-GAAP profits. So effectively, we'll be adding back any non-tax – any tax effect from the non-GAAP adjustments, and we will also assume, we will enjoy the – not enjoy the benefits of the NOLs. So, this approach will result in a higher tax rate in our non-GAAP earnings. For example, under the approach, the new approach will have approximately 31% in 2017, and that compares to a tax rate of 5% to 6% under the old cash tax rate. So, we've incorporated some of these tables in the prepared remarks to help you understand that. And as we look forward over the next three years, we would assume a 31% tax rate under the new method and a rate of 6% to 7% on a cash tax basis. So a little bit higher than the 5% to 6% that we've reported historically, due to some additional revenue that we've been talking about in Brazil and in China as well, but still a 6% to 7% over the foreseeable future. And the last... Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Sorry, can you remind me what the actual dollar amount of the tax loss carryforward is at present? Daniel David Tempesta - Nuance Communications, Inc. Sure, at the end of 2016, it was around $630 million. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thanks. Daniel David Tempesta - Nuance Communications, Inc. And then, the last thing I'll mention is, we're going to keep on reporting cash taxes on a supplemental basis. So, we're not going to include that, in the actual earnings calculation in the net income calculation. We will include that in the narrative, because there are a number of analysts and investors that use that in their models. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Ian Strgar with UBS. Please, go ahead. Ian Strgar - UBS Securities LLC Hey, guys thanks for taking my questions. Paul, can you update us on how the search for a new CEO is going, for when you're retiring, I believe in early 2018? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Yes, the board has formed a search committee, and it's really only in its preliminary activity, so we have no significant progress to report, but we will keep you appraised as the board complete this work. Ian Strgar - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Got it. And operating margins came in really strong for the quarter, can you maybe just elaborate a little bit on what led to being able to get over 30% operating margins? And then, maybe would you give us what you think your long-term target for where Nuance can get for operating margins in 2018 and beyond? I mean is this some mid-30s% operating margin business over the long-term? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Let's see, a couple of questions, let me take them in turn. Our operating margins enjoyed the benefit of some overachievement in our gross margins, the benefit, of course, of our overachievement in revenues, and good cost discipline up and down our operating expense lines. The second part of your question, what we have said previously is that, first, we expect margins to be in the range of 28% to 29% this year. We've confirmed that in today's comments. And we've previously suggested that we'll see a modest increase in operating margins as we look ahead to next year. Reminding investors that we have significant cost savings engineered into our business in 2017 and in 2018. But that it is our intention to direct the preponderance of those savings towards growth opportunities with the goal of continuing to lift our organic growth rate in 2018 and then again in 2019. So I think you should think of it as modest margin improvement as we look ahead over the next three years with focus on improving the top line and growth. Ian Strgar - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Got it. And if I could just squeeze one more in, the sales reorg in Imaging, can you guys just talk about where that's at? And how quickly we might expect the growth rates in Imaging to bounce back? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Well, they've done a lot of work in Imaging during the second quarter. It made a lot of progress. I think we're going to see the benefits of that progress in the second half. Revenues could be relatively flat in the second half, and bookings performance, I believe, will look up from where it's been in the first half. So I think we've turned a corner. But it will take some time to work the effect of those changes through the system. So I think this is a year in which we should expect to see the remediation with the goal of stabilization and setting up for growth next year based on additional sales investments we're making over the second half of this year and product investments we're also making in the business over the second half of this year. Ian Strgar - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for the color, guys. I appreciate it. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead. Josh Baer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. This is Josh on for Sanjit. You talked about a material increase in head count in Automotive. Wondering if you could expand a little more on where you're investing there? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. We're investing significantly in our services – Automotive services organization in order to fulfill on the bookings that we've seen in the later half of 2016 and have seen in 2017 and expect to see – continue to see throughout 2017. We simply have to – we simply have a greater – need a greater capacity in our Automotive business to serve customer obligations that we've been fortunate enough to win. We're also investing in R&D to accelerate the evolution of the Automotive product plan, in the desire to serve the vision we have of the connected car in 2020. Josh Baer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. And when you talk about a return to growth in FY 2018 in Healthcare segment, is that on a reported or organic basis? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. We're referring to organic. Josh Baer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. We'll go next to Nandan Amladi with Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead. Nandan G. Amladi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thanks for taking my question. So, Paul, what has changed in the quality and the close rates of the pipeline relative to sort of this time last year, when bookings have been a lot softer? Is it that the demand environment has changed? Is it that your product is now more competitive? Can you characterize what might be helping that? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Well, with as varied a set of markets as we have, one would have to answer that question specifically in each market. But I think if we try to look generally across the company, I think that the overall interest in the kind of intelligence solutions we build, has grown as visibility around the opportunity and the potential of those solutions, has increased. I think our investments in our go-to-market approaches, beginning in the latter half of last year, has paid dividend for us. And I do think our product investments are allowing us to effectively target opportunities, a good example of that, of course, would be the robust perception around Dragon Medical One, which has only been in the market for, I think, 15 months – 12 months to 18 months now. Nandan G. Amladi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. And the sort of related question, specific to Healthcare. As you look at the product mix that you're selling today, how much of the contribution is coming from new products on the Clintegrity and CDI side relative to, are you just mentioned Dragon Medical has had the pretty strong uptick. So if you think about new versus upsell into the base, what does that mix look like today versus a year ago? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. I don't have a precise number for what the relative contribution of new versus installed of existing customer is compared to a year ago, I apologize, I do know that we're doing quite well in cultivating new customers in that business. And I think that's part of what's contributing to the quality of the pipeline we have in Healthcare, which although I had not commented on specifically is really extraordinary pipeline right now for us. Nandan G. Amladi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum. Please, go ahead. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Great. Thanks for taking my question. Paul, as it relates to, I guess start with the Auto side, obviously, you're working on your models, but just any changes in win rates at this point? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. No. We've been very fortunate and customer support for our solutions, and we win a very strong majority of solutions and that has been true for some time and continues to be so. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC And then with respect to Dragon, how far are we – I think you suggested in the commentary we're kind of through the bulk of this transition to a recurring model from new sales? I'm just curious specific to the installed premise customers, what kind of dataset have you built so far in terms of being able to convert them from maintenance payers to actually full-paying subscription users on the new offering? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. I don't have the percentage of that at the top of my head. We – I think our comments were meant to suggest that the downward pressure on revenues from the Dragon transition is significantly behind us, it's mostly behind us at this point. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Okay. And then I guess lastly on the handset side. It sounded as though that is one of the areas where you're calling out the declines are over, or at least the worse of them are over. Can you just talk about both the rev rec and the sequential improvement in revenues there? And then also bookings, just a little bit of an overview on what's going on the Auto or the handset space? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Well, of course the Mobile numbers we published are composite of the Automotive, handset and smartphone and IoT and the mobile operators segment. And the handset, the smartphone business is in decline as we've discussed now for some time and we expect that particular sub-segment to continue to decline. It is going to be offset by the growth of IoT opportunities we've mentioned such as smart home, but that's a relatively small business today, but the performance of that business has been driven by the other two sub-segments, Automotive and mobile operators. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Right. Understood. And then, lastly, Paul, any even modest tweaks at the edges in terms of likely uses of capital? You're obviously generating some great cash flows here and getting better. Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. No. I think, we've indicated in over several quarters now that we have a balanced agenda of share buybacks, debt reduction, and modest acquisitions. And I think, that remains our approach. Daniel David Tempesta - Nuance Communications, Inc. Hey Jeff, let me just remind you too. We did – with the recent convert we did, we raised – we bought back $100 million, which matched our plan for the year. And with the capital – the earlier capital transactions, we will have – once we settle the convert that's due in November, we would have taken down our debt balances by about $150 million. So that really is supporting what we've talked about. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please, go ahead. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. I joined a few minutes late, so apologies if these were already asked. Maybe first for you, Dan, in the prepared remarks we called out the Cablevision and Roku wins in the quarter. Can you talk to whether those benefited the Mobile business or Mobile revenues at all here in the second quarter? And just maybe broadly speaking, can you remind us how the revenue models for these types of customers in that smart home vertical work mechanically? Daniel David Tempesta - Nuance Communications, Inc. Sure. I think those two were just bookings, and they didn't contribute to the revenues this quarter. The smart home can work in a number of ways. It can work with an active user per month. And so if a person uses the system, then we'll get paid per month for that usage. It can work on a per device approach. So but it's usually transactional based on usage. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe for my follow-up for you, Paul. Paul, you mentioned in response to another question the strong performance in Dragon Medical One. We certainly see it in the bookings commentary in Healthcare. Can you just talk qualitatively about where this is coming from? I mean we've got such dominant share in that vertical – in that market. So is the success with Dragon Medical One coming from winning new customers, is it taking share, maybe upgrading existing customers? How do you think about the robust performance there? Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. I think we are converting existing customers around a broader vision of integrated clinical documentation based on cloud platform. I think we are winning new customers, some of whom are competitive customers. And I think we are expanding more successfully into the middle market. I think it's a combination of those three things. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc. Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks very much, guys. Operator Thank you. We now have a question from Tom Roderick with Stifel. Please, go ahead. Tom Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hey, guys. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. So, Paul, I've got a two-part question for you here related to acquisitions. The first year, can you just help us understand what sort of contributions TouchCommerce is having on the Enterprise business there? I mean, it looks like the organic growth has been great, both with and without TouchCommerce over the last four quarters. I know you've only had them for a few quarters of that. So talk about how that's impacting the numbers? And then if you wouldn't mind giving us a sense of sort of what to expect in that segment organically as you lap that? I know the comps will get tougher. And then the second part of the question here is, it looks like there's a $50 million use of cash for acquisitions in the quarter. I think the mCarbon Tech deal was reported back in February. Can you talk a little bit about what you got there? And how you expect that to contribute to the business for the remainder of this year? Thanks. Paul A. Ricci - Nuance Communications, Inc. Last year when we bought TouchCommerce, I believe we gave an indication that TouchCommerce would contribute about $70 million in this year's financial plan. And it is on target to achieve that number. And so that's a reasonable number for you to work with. I think the mCarbon contribution over the course of this year is immaterial. Tom Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Daniel David Tempesta - Nuance Communications, Inc. Yes. And the $50 million that you related to is not related to mCarbon, it was – mCarbon was a small piece of that. We also did a purchase of some IP. Tom Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Perfect. Okay. That's helpful. A much bigger picture question here for you, Paul, as you think about the Automotive segment. I know it's much too early to expect any contribution to that business from the autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicle segment. But how do you think about how you want to see the business invest in that opportunity over the next 12 months to 24 months? Do you think about that as a big opportunity for Nuance if you look out three years to five years? Or is it too early to even consider making investments on the R&D side there? Paul A.

But the automotive manufacturers, as you know, see a transformation going on in the vision of the automobile in the near to medium future that includes a far more robust connected car, in part to enjoy the benefits of more autonomous driving. And we do participate in that vision of a connected car and that, I think, relates to the investments I was referring to earlier. We're doing very well in that business and it remains a major focus of growth for us as we look out over the three-year horizon. Tom Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Excellent. Thank you for the detail. Appreciate it. Operator Thank you. And, our final question will come from David Hynes with Canaccord. Go ahead, please. David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Yeah. Hey. Thanks. Just one from me. Paul, you outlined some of the reactive expense growth, right, commission support infrastructure. The business has really been kind of in expense management mode here for the last couple of years, curious kind of what the – with the improved bookings growth environment and I'm sure, you're going to start thinking about budgeting for 2018 soon?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jeff Palmer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Jeff Palmer Great thank you, Skyler, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors' third quarter 2016 earnings call. With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer, NXP's President and CEO, and Dan Durn, our CFO. If you've not obtained a copy of our third quarter 2016 earnings press release, it can be found at our Company Web site under the Investor Relations section at nxp.com. As most of you have likely see the Qualcomm and NXP press release this morning, and we appreciate your patience and waiting for our earnings call to begin. Our earnings call today we’ll keep to our prepared remarks to the key points so we can quickly get to your question. This call is being recorded and will be available for reply from our corporate Web site. Our call today will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please be reminded, NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements. For a full disclosure on forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release. Additionally, during the call today, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to Regulation G, NXP has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our third quarter 2016 press release, which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K and is available on the NXP Web site. I'd like to now turn the call over to Rick. Rick Clemmer Thanks, Jeff. And welcome everyone to our earnings call today. As Jeff mentioned, we're very excited about the transaction we announced this morning. In lieu of time, we want to provide a summary of our Q3 results and provide you with guidance for Q4. We will keep our comments brief, but we're prepared to address any questions you may have concerning the quarterly performance throughout the day. NXP finished Q3 with very good performance. Revenue was up just over 4% sequentially with all business lines delivering results in line with our guidance. We drove strong non-GAAP operating margins due to a combination of solid execution by the business and operations teams, which drove better than planned non-GAAP gross margin, when combined with strong operating expense control. Taken together, this resulted in very strong non-GAAP free cash flow. Looking at the specifics, revenue in Q3 was $2.47 billion, an increase of just over 4% versus the prior quarter, and up 62% versus the year ago period. Looking at the HPMS segment, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of just over 4% from the prior quarter and up 80% from Q3 2015. From an operating segment perspective, the results are as follows. Automotive, revenue was $853 million, down 1% quarter-on-quarter, but up 177% from the year ago period. In terms of product line trends, Auto MCU advanced Analog and Sensors were all slightly better than planned, with infotainment down modestly. In Secure Connected Devices, revenue was $592 million, up 15% sequentially and up 87% year-on-year. With our mobile transaction group, we experienced strong seasonal improvements as a result of both our largest smartphone customer, as well as good traction on new models with Korean and Chinese OEMs. Progress with deploying our mobile mass transit solution in China is going very well. Mobile transit or mass mobile payments, or mass transit is a perfect intersection of secure payments and high throughput mass transit; all delivered on a mobile device. And China’s six out of this ten initial largest cities are up and running with our mobile transit solutions, and eight OEMs have launched this solution. Initial activation rates are very good, and post activation top-offs are showing promising trend. In the MCU group, revenue was up sequentially as we saw very good demand for 32-bit ARM based MCUs and solid demand for our i.MX apps processors that was offset by roll-off of legacy MCUs. Lastly, we experienced solid demand in our mobile audio business as new products have gained solid tractions with Chinese Android handset OEMs. Within SI&I our Interface and Communications Infrastructure Group, revenue was $476 million, up 8% sequentially and up 76% year-on-year. In the Interface Group demand was strong and slightly ahead of plan due to the seasonal handset trends, similar to what we saw in the mobile transactions group. In the RF Power group, revenue declined sequentially as anticipated. At this stage, we believe the wireless base station markets will continue to be relatively soft over the intermediate term. Given the supply chain model in the base station market, we continue to have difficulties determining accurate in-market demand trend. In the Digital Networking market, we experienced flattish demand as anticipated, and believe the business has began to bottom-out. We are somewhat encouraged, as we are seeing composite trends in terms of design win, and particularly in the enterprise wireless access and switching space. Within SIS, revenue was $178 million, down 11% sequentially, and down 34% from year-ago. This was essentially in line with our inline our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. We do not see growth in this business in the near-term, as China banking continues to be weak and there is no incremental benefit to NXP from the U.S. contact EMD market based on the current market and competitive dynamics that we’ve mentioned in the past. At this point in time, the trends within the e-gabbing transit and access in- market with some improvements are not sufficient to offset the decline in the banking revenue. As our fourth quarter guidance reflects, we’re guiding for further stepdown in this business. We think over the intermediate term, revenue will hover around $150 million per quarter, although Q1s are typically seasonally weak, and our Q1 could be this time. Turning now to the Standard Products segment, revenue was $320 million, slightly better than our expectations, reflecting an increase to 6% from the prior quarter and down 2% from the year ago period. Turning to our distribution channel performance. The total months of inventory in the distribution channel held steady at 2.5, with absolute dollars of the inventory, increasing $45 million on a sequential basis. In summary, Q3 was a solid quarter with the strong financial performance, a positive reflection on the progress towards our committed goal. We view the overall stemming market as being next. In certain end market, like auto and SBD business trends are very encouraging. However, the market trends in the SIS, RF Power, digital networking, continued to create headwinds for the overall business. We believe we found a bottom in both SIS and digital networking, the two most challenged business in our portfolio. Now, I'd like to pass the call to Dan for a review of our financial performance. Dan? Daniel Durn Thanks, Rick, and good morning to everyone on today's call. To get your questions as quickly as possible, I’m going to read in an abbreviated version of my script today, hitting on what we believe are the key points. We will post the complete script on the IR Web site after the call. We delivered strong financial performance in Q3 with key highlights being: we delivered revenue that was above the midpoint of guidance; our strong operational execution drove non-GAAP gross margins above the plan; we tightly controlled our operating expenses, resulting in better fall-through and stronger non-GAAP operating margin; we generated excellent cash flow in the quarter and deployed over $0.5 billion in share repurchases; specifically, we delivered revenue of $2.47 billion in Q3, up 4% sequentially and the non-GAAP gross margin toward the high-end of our guidance at 50.5%. Total NXP non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 was at the high end of our guidance at 28%, which is up 240 basis-points sequentially, and up 470 basis-points in the last two quarters alone. This strong margin improvement demonstrates great progress in driving synergy capture well ahead of plan. As we have said in the past, the best way to measure our success in capturing merger synergies is to look at the progression of our non-GAAP operating margin. Since the merger closed, we have successfully driven 54 basis-points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion. On a $10 billion revenue run rate, this 540 basis-points of margin improvement, which suggests that we have already exceeded the $500 million synergy run-rate target within the first three quarters post close and more than a full-year ahead of the schedule communicated at the time we announced the merger. In terms of capital allocation, during the quarter, we repurchased 6.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $555 million or $86.3 per share. This brings our total year-to-date share repurchases to just over $1.2 billion, or 14.9 million shares at an average price of $81.62 per share. I would now like to provide our outlook for the fourth quarter. We currently anticipate Q4 revenue will be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. At the midpoint, we expect revenue to be about $2.44 billion in Q4. We expect the following trends in the business during that quarter. Auto is expected to be flat, which is well ahead of normal seasonality and much better than Q4 from the year ago period. Secure Connected Devices is expected to be down modestly in the low single-digit range. Secure Interface & Infrastructure is expected to be down modestly in the low single-digit range. Secure Identification Solutions is expected to be down in the mid-teens percentage range sequentially. Standard Products is expected to be flat sequentially. We anticipate revenue from manufacturing, corporate and other to be approximately $52 million. At the midpoint, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 50.7% and non-GAAP operating margin to be 28.3%. Lastly, our Q4 guidance contemplates about $12 million of IP license revenue. It is unclear how the pending acquisition will impact our IP revenue pipeline going margin. And finally, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the status of the Standard Products divestiture. We've received all the regulatory approvals associated with the divestiture. The disentanglement process is going very well and we're on track to close the divesture in Q1 of 2017. From a financial model perspective, post the divestiture, NXP will drive top-line growth in the range of 5% to 7% CAGR over the 2016 to 2019 timeframe. Post divestiture, NXP will have a superior profit margin profile with our long-term non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 53% to 57%. We will tightly control our non-GAAP OpEx spend envelope into a range of 14% to 16% for R&D, and 6% to 8% for SG&A. Taken together, we anticipate our long-term non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 31% to 34% for NXP. From a timing perspective, as we discussed in our Analyst Day earlier this year, we believe we can enter the lower band of our long-term margin ranges exiting '17. This means total Company non-GAAP gross margin should be about 53%, and non-GAAP operating margin should be about 31% as we exit 2017. To be clear, this is an exit rate, not a full-year 2017 number. Our long-term margin progression guidance assumes we continue strong execution on synergy capture, and we minimize the impact to stranded costs from the divestiture throughout 2017. In terms of the use of proceeds, NXP will net $2.3 billion from the divestitures. We will use the proceeds to reduce our gross debt and achieve our 2-times net leverage target. We plan to redeem three tranches of debt. First, we will redeem the $390 million term loan due in 2017. Second, we will redeem the $500 million, 5.75% senior notes due in 2021. And lastly, we will pay-down approximately $1 billion of the term loans due in 2020. Post redemptions, gross debt will be approximately $7.5 billion with a weighted cost of debt at 3.6%, and an annual interest expense of approximately $275 million. Putting this together with the Q4 cash balance and adjusted EBITDA, that is consistent with Q3 where we saw net leverage of 2-time]. The ultimate amount of pay-down of the 2020 term loans may vary up or down depending on what is required to achieve the 2-times net leverage target. Lastly, we anticipate that our cash taxes in 2017 will be about $30 million to $35 million per quarter. With that, I would now like to turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. John Pitzer I just want to go back to the channel inventory. It looks like it was up sequentially in the September quarter. What do you think drove that? And as you looking cautiously your December quarter guidance. What would you expect channel inventory to look like exiting the December quarter? Rick Clemmer So to be clear John, it was up. I think it was $34 million. So it was up in terms of dollar level, but it was still at 2.5 months of inventory. So we’ve still continued to be around that level. To be clear, as we go forward, we’re not planning on it changing significantly, but we want to be opportunistic. There is a lot of interesting things developing in the channel market with one of our competitors and we want to be sure that we’re playing that opportunistically to have an impact from a top-line revenue growth basis. John Pitzer And then, Dan, I just want to make sure I understand some of the up margin, you’re taking t about exiting 2017. I guess, first, does that include or exclude the standard product divestiture I apologize if I missed that. And just given the announcement this morning, would there be opportunity to try to sum to accelerate some of the organic synergy gains at NXP ahead of the merger? Or how should we think about that? Daniel Durn So, John, a couple of things. First, the guidance we gave just provide clarity, post the divestiture, how the Company will profile. It’s very consistent with what we said at the Analyst Day, and very consistent with what was said at the time we announced the divestiture of Standard Products. Exiting the year, on a run-rate, we’ll be close the low-end of our margin guidelines. It will not be a full-year 2017 number. In terms of pre-close synergy capture opportunities, we have to absolutely clear on this. While we can plan for integration as a Company and strong execution post close is a function of really stay on granular detailed bottoms-up planning. It is just that planning. So there will be no change to the decisions we or Qualcomm made as independent company in the deal pendency period. And we will continue to execute against the plan we just communicated. Post close of the Qualcomm transaction. That is when you'll start to see decision makings reflecting the combination of the two entities, and economic impact associated with it. Rick Clemmer And maybe just one thing I'd like to point out, John. We talked about that our Q4 outlook includes $12 of intellectual property revenue. And there could be an impact from decision that we announced this morning associated with that. So, we want to be clear. That's included in our guidance, and we'll have to be sure that we fully understand that as we better understand the implications of the announcement today. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ross Seymore I guess, the first question is on the deal with Qualcomm. How in your perspective, either Dan or Rick, do you reconcile the earnings power that the Company described at Analyst Meeting earlier this year, with the price that Qualcomm is paying and you're accepting that price. Any framework in how you view valuation will be helpful? Rick Clemmer I think, Ross, it's really important to realize that the pre-rumour price, this represents 34% premium. So for a transaction of this size, it's a pretty sizeable premium. That being said, as we looked at the opportunity that we have on connected devices, we've been talking about this. Ultimately we needed to have a better connectivity portfolio to be able to drive the leadership that we wanted to be able to achieve. Specifically, and autonomous driving it, it's become more obvious to curtain over the last few quarters that we needed increased computing horsepower to be able to do machine learning, and really be able to take advantage of the complete ad hoc solution as opposed to the areas where we had clearly identified the leadership that can drive. So, we think that's very complementary. Although, we have good connectivity platform for our current portfolio as we look out over the next few years. We’ve clearly had to expand our connectivity capability to be in the leadership position we wanted to on the Internet of Things. And as we focus on secure connections for the smarter world. The combination of this brings together pretty nicely, our Board went through this and approved this based on their view associated with the price. I think the other thing that we shouldn't lose sight of is there's a lot of broker lap between the shareholders of both company. And there's clearly an opportunity for both shareholders that view the value creation opportunity as significant as we do for them to participate in that by actually buying Qualcomm shares. Ross Seymore And I guess as my follow-up. Dan and Rick, you could answer this too, if you wish. But you did a great job of running us through where the margin structure will be as we think about the next 12 months or so. From the revenue side of the equation, at that same Analyst Meeting earlier this year, you talked about 5% to 7% growth rate over-time. I realize that doesn't imply to any given single year. But how are you thinking about that as you look into 2017 as like automotive are doing better than people feared, and you're growing well on SBD. But area is like SIS and maybe the high power RF might be a little disappointed, or just disappointing versus what you might have expected in May? Daniel Durn My answer will probably leave you a little unsatisfied. The revenue CAGR we gave you is exactly that a CAGR over a three year widow. I think we have a portfolio of businesses. And like you point you and like Rick said in his comments, we’ve got some businesses that are performing really-really well. We've got some businesses that are performing in line. And then we’ve got a couple of businesses that are living in a difficult neighborhood right now. And so rather than getting to an extra size with guides, one year out, what we want to do is just stick to the three year CAGR. We understand than markets we participate in. You understand the core franchises we have, the leaderships positions we have, within those respective end markets and the performance profile of those businesses. And that should give me a pretty good idea of how profile next year. But we won’t get into the extra size of guiding the year out. Rick Clemmer I think the only thing that we could add is when you look at our outlook for Q4, the guidance that we set, that we talked about 2016 will be a transition for us. And Q4 not being down as you would typically be on a seasonal basis. It’s actually a little better than the environment. So, I think it actually portray an leading indicator relative to it. But as Dan said, we really only guiding. We’ve only established that on a three-years compounded growth rate, but it’s just not in the individual units period. Operator And next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein Thanks for taking my question. And then I’ll add my congratulations to the deal this morning, I’ve two question if I can. First, Dan, you highlighted that the Company has already achieved its $500 million cost savings run-rate quite a bit earlier than expected. I wonder how much you see as left. Now that you’ve achieved that, do you think there is more to go as the Company progresses? Daniel Durn I think I will use the goal post. Where we’re today and where we will exit 2017. And at the time of the announcement, we’ve talked about this being synergy capture window. And I think with those goal post in place and the trajectory implied by those goal posts, I think that you can pretty quickly come up to what that is, rather than go out with a specific number, I think the goal post gets you where you need to be. William Stein And the next question is about the seasonally strong growth in autos for Q4, I think seasonally that’s a down quarter, but you’re guiding up. Should we use it’s, it’s uncertainly like a content growth opportunity. Is this the initial ramp of V2X, is that meaningful part of the separation? Or is there something else going on there? And any update on other V2X design winds in general would be much appreciated. Rick Clemmer Will, it’s broad based. So I think the key is it’s not V2X. V2X is not a significant revenue contributor in Q4 this year. There is some shipments taking place obviously on the design win that we’ve talked about. But as far as being a significant contributor into revenue, it’s not in V2X. It's pretty broad based, but really focused on MCUs, and beginning to ramp some of the design wins that had been achieved over the last few years as those begin to be realized and shipped into the customer. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Stacy Rasgon I want to go back to the deal-stop. I understand I think the need to achieve a better connectivity portfolio, to achieve your goals. But if that’s the case, why is selling for $110 to somebody else absolutely the best way to get that needed connectivity? I mean if I just look at the stocks right now, in the pre-market, Qualcomm is up something like 4% or more. You guys are up barely 2%, which suggested right now shareholders of Qualcomm are happier with the deal than shareholders of NXP. So, why is this the best way to get what you need in order to achieve your growth goal? Rick Clemmer So, Stacy I think it's -- obviously, any value is what you negotiate between two parties. And we can't lose sight of the fact that it was a 34% premium to the pre-disclosure, pre-rumour period. And when you think about a transaction of this magnitude, a 34% premium is at least as we've been advised pushing the limit associated with it. I think if we think about the future, the value of bringing the two companies together and bringing the most compelling platform in the industry going forward, it's just too significant of an opportunity to forgo. And so we think that we've gone through this with our Board and our Board feels like that this is a fair price, and a price that's reasonable for our shareholders. And our shareholders frankly have the ability that if they see the opportunity as you do or it sounds like you do and we do, they can participate by buying Qualcomm shares associated with it. So, we think it does represent a fair value. Clearly, being at the 34% premium to the pre-rumour price is a significant factor associated with it. And Peter Kelly -- Stacy, Peter has joined us too here. Peter Kelly Stacy, I just want to say I guess one thing. I mean, overall, I do thing this is a terrific deal. You're right in pointing out that Qualcomm shareholders are very pleased. As Rick said, the improvements in our stock price versus and unaffected price is very-very substantial. And I'm not at kind of cope or finance expert, but I think our stock will trade more on discounts to close than anything else in the coming months. But I do think this is a terrific deal. Stacy Rasgon And just to follow-up on that though. I mean, why wouldn't you guys be willing to -- put in the work over the next few years to achieve a higher stock price on your own. I mean this thing isn’t going to close for over a year anyways. What makes you think you couldn't get the stock price above a $110 on your own by the end of 2017? It seems like given the margin targets you talked about and the growth goals you talked at the Analyst Day, something that would be or should be achievable with more upside beyond that. So like why wouldn't you try to get it now rather than selling out at $110 today? Rick Clemmer So, Stacy I think the key is we're comfortable with the performance we've laid out. We're very comfortable with the portfolio we have. The opportunity to have a more complete ubiquitous platform to be able to address the market opportunities we see, we just thought it was too significant an opportunity for go. We think that it's extremely compelling. We think that our shareholders have the ability to achieve a reasonable value out of this transaction. And again if they believe as strongly as we do in the opportunity they can participate in it through Qualcomm shares. And there's a significant cross-holding between the two companies in any case, Stacy. So, this has nothing to do with us. Not believing in what we've laid out. We still feel very comfortable associated with that. If you look at what we've traded over the last couple of years, we typically have traded at a discount to our peers associated with the industry. And so for us to be able to achieve this with very significant premium for a very large deal is something that we feel like is really as good result and one that we’re very pleased with. Peter Kelly And as Rick said, this is about creating a powerhouse. This is just a fantastic opportunity. So just create a powerhouse company. Stacy Rasgon Okay, thank you. Rick Clemmer Thanks Stacy. Jeff Palmer Operator, we’ll take one last call here this morning. We’ve got -- we want to keep this abbreviated today. Operator Okay. Our last question comes from line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is now open. Tore Svanberg Rick, you mentioned the Secure ID business is bottoming. And I think you said that for two quarters now, is expected to be down again sequentially in the double-digits for the December quarter. What are some of the milestone that we should look out for that business finally stabilizing? Rick Clemmer That’s a really good question. I think that we shouldn’t lose sight of that that business is really the technology that gives us the ability to provide security on a broad base set of solutions. Now, in addition to that, obviously, we have product shipments that take place associated with it. And clearly, we’ve had the benefit of the stocking of the contact with bank cards in China, which we were kind of that they end up. Now, it’s going to be more of a replenishment cycle associate with it, which is not going to offer the same kind of volumes that we’ve had in the past. And with some of the competitive practices and activities, we see associated with contacts base, we’re actually being very selective in our participation associate with it. And that’s the reason why that business is not performing as we would have liked for it to several years ago. We’re down to a point where we think it's going kind of be stable. But we’ve been at this point in the past. But we did talk about the fact that there is seasonality to that business which is typically down in Q1. So even if we’re at this bottom, we could be that in any individual quarter, they could go below that. But we think we’re at that run-rate. And actually, as a percentage of the total volume, now the trends are ticketing, as well as the e-gab side becomes the larger share of the total. And we do see a number of design-wins there. As we’ve talked about in the past, that tends to be fairly lumpy. And so it’s not really a nice move to progression associated with it. But we do feel good about the business. And again, the key is trying to drive the security technology on a broad base across many applications for the total Company, especially when you begin to think about it on a combined basis. Tore Svanberg And as my follow-up, you mentioned the wireless base station market seems to still be soft and will remain soft. What are some of the data-points to support that? And is there any visibility as to when that market potentially start growing again? Thank you. Peter Kelly So the data points that support that revenue, which continues to be hard to predict, based on the supply chain that’s not easy to call. I think it's -- when you think about the fundamental assumptions, I think, we’re going to continue to see an expansion of data over wireless network. So, you should see fundamentally the ability for base stations to grow. But it's virtually impossible for us to project when that will take place. We continue to be leader in that space, so that’s very positive opportunity for us. It’s a profitable business. As we see the industry moving to more content associated with across the wireless networks, we do think there is some opportunities for the early implementation of 5G, our massive MIMO. They could play a role in increases in revenue in the upcoming quarters. But it's certainly not going to be a factor in the next few quarters. So, we expect that business to continually really hard to predict, but very nice profitability and one that we continue to be a leader in. Tore Svanberg Fair enough. Thank you. Peter Kelly Thanks. Rick Clemmer Well, everyone, thank you very much for attending our call today. We realized it was abbreviated call. But given the announcement first thing this morning, we want to let you guys get back to our new notes and things. We really appreciate all your support. And with that, we'd like to end the call today. Thank you very much. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

And just given the announcement this morning, would there be opportunity to try to sum to accelerate some of the organic synergy gains at NXP ahead of the merger? Or how should we think about that? Daniel Durn So, John, a couple of things. First, the guidance we gave just provide clarity, post the divestiture, how the Company will profile. It’s very consistent with what we said at the Analyst Day, and very consistent with what was said at the time we announced the divestiture of Standard Products. Exiting the year, on a run-rate, we’ll be close the low-end of our margin guidelines. It will not be a full-year 2017 number. In terms of pre-close synergy capture opportunities, we have to absolutely clear on this. While we can plan for integration as a Company and strong execution post close is a function of really stay on granular detailed bottoms-up planning. It is just that planning. So there will be no change to the decisions we or Qualcomm made as independent company in the deal pendency period. And we will continue to execute against the plan we just communicated. Post close of the Qualcomm transaction. That is when you'll start to see decision makings reflecting the combination of the two entities, and economic impact associated with it. Rick Clemmer And maybe just one thing I'd like to point out, John. We talked about that our Q4 outlook includes $12 of intellectual property revenue. And there could be an impact from decision that we announced this morning associated with that. So, we want to be clear. That's included in our guidance, and we'll have to be sure that we fully understand that as we better understand the implications of the announcement today. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ross Seymore I guess, the first question is on the deal with Qualcomm. How in your perspective, either Dan or Rick, do you reconcile the earnings power that the Company described at Analyst Meeting earlier this year, with the price that Qualcomm is paying and you're accepting that price. Any framework in how you view valuation will be helpful? Rick Clemmer I think, Ross, it's really important to realize that the pre-rumour price, this represents 34% premium. So for a transaction of this size, it's a pretty sizeable premium. That being said, as we looked at the opportunity that we have on connected devices, we've been talking about this. Ultimately we needed to have a better connectivity portfolio to be able to drive the leadership that we wanted to be able to achieve. Specifically, and autonomous driving it, it's become more obvious to curtain over the last few quarters that we needed increased computing horsepower to be able to do machine learning, and really be able to take advantage of the complete ad hoc solution as opposed to the areas where we had clearly identified the leadership that can drive. So, we think that's very complementary. Although, we have good connectivity platform for our current portfolio as we look out over the next few years. We’ve clearly had to expand our connectivity capability to be in the leadership position we wanted to on the Internet of Things. And as we focus on secure connections for the smarter world. The combination of this brings together pretty nicely, our Board went through this and approved this based on their view associated with the price. I think the other thing that we shouldn't lose sight of is there's a lot of broker lap between the shareholders of both company. And there's clearly an opportunity for both shareholders that view the value creation opportunity as significant as we do for them to participate in that by actually buying Qualcomm shares. Ross Seymore And I guess as my follow-up. Dan and Rick, you could answer this too, if you wish. But you did a great job of running us through where the margin structure will be as we think about the next 12 months or so. From the revenue side of the equation, at that same Analyst Meeting earlier this year, you talked about 5% to 7% growth rate over-time. I realize that doesn't imply to any given single year. But how are you thinking about that as you look into 2017 as like automotive are doing better than people feared, and you're growing well on SBD. But area is like SIS and maybe the high power RF might be a little disappointed, or just disappointing versus what you might have expected in May? Daniel Durn My answer will probably leave you a little unsatisfied. The revenue CAGR we gave you is exactly that a CAGR over a three year widow. I think we have a portfolio of businesses. And like you point you and like Rick said in his comments, we’ve got some businesses that are performing really-really well. We've got some businesses that are performing in line. And then we’ve got a couple of businesses that are living in a difficult neighborhood right now. And so rather than getting to an extra size with guides, one year out, what we want to do is just stick to the three year CAGR. We understand than markets we participate in. You understand the core franchises we have, the leaderships positions we have, within those respective end markets and the performance profile of those businesses. And that should give me a pretty good idea of how profile next year. But we won’t get into the extra size of guiding the year out. Rick Clemmer I think the only thing that we could add is when you look at our outlook for Q4, the guidance that we set, that we talked about 2016 will be a transition for us. And Q4 not being down as you would typically be on a seasonal basis. It’s actually a little better than the environment. So, I think it actually portray an leading indicator relative to it. But as Dan said, we really only guiding. We’ve only established that on a three-years compounded growth rate, but it’s just not in the individual units period. Operator And next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein Thanks for taking my question. And then I’ll add my congratulations to the deal this morning, I’ve two question if I can. First, Dan, you highlighted that the Company has already achieved its $500 million cost savings run-rate quite a bit earlier than expected. I wonder how much you see as left. Now that you’ve achieved that, do you think there is more to go as the Company progresses? Daniel Durn I think I will use the goal post. Where we’re today and where we will exit 2017. And at the time of the announcement, we’ve talked about this being synergy capture window. And I think with those goal post in place and the trajectory implied by those goal posts, I think that you can pretty quickly come up to what that is, rather than go out with a specific number, I think the goal post gets you where you need to be. William Stein And the next question is about the seasonally strong growth in autos for Q4, I think seasonally that’s a down quarter, but you’re guiding up. Should we use it’s, it’s uncertainly like a content growth opportunity. Is this the initial ramp of V2X, is that meaningful part of the separation? Or is there something else going on there? And any update on other V2X design winds in general would be much appreciated. Rick Clemmer Will, it’s broad based. So I think the key is it’s not V2X. V2X is not a significant revenue contributor in Q4 this year. There is some shipments taking place obviously on the design win that we’ve talked about. But as far as being a significant contributor into revenue, it’s not in V2X. It's pretty broad based, but really focused on MCUs, and beginning to ramp some of the design wins that had been achieved over the last few years as those begin to be realized and shipped into the customer. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Stacy Rasgon I want to go back to the deal-stop. I understand I think the need to achieve a better connectivity portfolio, to achieve your goals. But if that’s the case, why is selling for $110 to somebody else absolutely the best way to get that needed connectivity? I mean if I just look at the stocks right now, in the pre-market, Qualcomm is up something like 4% or more. You guys are up barely 2%, which suggested right now shareholders of Qualcomm are happier with the deal than shareholders of NXP. So, why is this the best way to get what you need in order to achieve your growth goal? Rick Clemmer So, Stacy I think it's -- obviously, any value is what you negotiate between two parties. And we can't lose sight of the fact that it was a 34% premium to the pre-disclosure, pre-rumour period. And when you think about a transaction of this magnitude, a 34% premium is at least as we've been advised pushing the limit associated with it. I think if we think about the future, the value of bringing the two companies together and bringing the most compelling platform in the industry going forward, it's just too significant of an opportunity to forgo. And so we think that we've gone through this with our Board and our Board feels like that this is a fair price, and a price that's reasonable for our shareholders. And our shareholders frankly have the ability that if they see the opportunity as you do or it sounds like you do and we do, they can participate by buying Qualcomm shares associated with it. So, we think it does represent a fair value. Clearly, being at the 34% premium to the pre-rumour price is a significant factor associated with it. And Peter Kelly -- Stacy, Peter has joined us too here. Peter Kelly Stacy, I just want to say I guess one thing. I mean, overall, I do thing this is a terrific deal. You're right in pointing out that Qualcomm shareholders are very pleased. As Rick said, the improvements in our stock price versus and unaffected price is very-very substantial. And I'm not at kind of cope or finance expert, but I think our stock will trade more on discounts to close than anything else in the coming months. But I do think this is a terrific deal. Stacy Rasgon And just to follow-up on that though. I mean, why wouldn't you guys be willing to -- put in the work over the next few years to achieve a higher stock price on your own. I mean this thing isn’t going to close for over a year anyways. What makes you think you couldn't get the stock price above a $110 on your own by the end of 2017? It seems like given the margin targets you talked about and the growth goals you talked at the Analyst Day, something that would be or should be achievable with more upside beyond that. So like why wouldn't you try to get it now rather than selling out at $110 today? Rick Clemmer So, Stacy I think the key is we're comfortable with the performance we've laid out. We're very comfortable with the portfolio we have. The opportunity to have a more complete ubiquitous platform to be able to address the market opportunities we see, we just thought it was too significant an opportunity for go. We think that it's extremely compelling. We think that our shareholders have the ability to achieve a reasonable value out of this transaction. And again if they believe as strongly as we do in the opportunity they can participate in it through Qualcomm shares. And there's a significant cross-holding between the two companies in any case, Stacy. So, this has nothing to do with us. Not believing in what we've laid out. We still feel very comfortable associated with that. If you look at what we've traded over the last couple of years, we typically have traded at a discount to our peers associated with the industry. And so for us to be able to achieve this with very significant premium for a very large deal is something that we feel like is really as good result and one that we’re very pleased with. Peter Kelly And as Rick said, this is about creating a powerhouse. This is just a fantastic opportunity. So just create a powerhouse company. Stacy Rasgon Okay, thank you. Rick Clemmer Thanks Stacy. Jeff Palmer Operator, we’ll take one last call here this morning. We’ve got -- we want to keep this abbreviated today. Operator Okay. Our last question comes from line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is now open. Tore Svanberg Rick, you mentioned the Secure ID business is bottoming. And I think you said that for two quarters now, is expected to be down again sequentially in the double-digits for the December quarter. What are some of the milestone that we should look out for that business finally stabilizing? Rick Clemmer That’s a really good question. I think that we shouldn’t lose sight of that that business is really the technology that gives us the ability to provide security on a broad base set of solutions. Now, in addition to that, obviously, we have product shipments that take place associated with it. And clearly, we’ve had the benefit of the stocking of the contact with bank cards in China, which we were kind of that they end up. Now, it’s going to be more of a replenishment cycle associate with it, which is not going to offer the same kind of volumes that we’ve had in the past. And with some of the competitive practices and activities, we see associated with contacts base, we’re actually being very selective in our participation associate with it. And that’s the reason why that business is not performing as we would have liked for it to several years ago. We’re down to a point where we think it's going kind of be stable. But we’ve been at this point in the past. But we did talk about the fact that there is seasonality to that business which is typically down in Q1. So even if we’re at this bottom, we could be that in any individual quarter, they could go below that. But we think we’re at that run-rate. And actually, as a percentage of the total volume, now the trends are ticketing, as well as the e-gab side becomes the larger share of the total. And we do see a number of design-wins there. As we’ve talked about in the past, that tends to be fairly lumpy. And so it’s not really a nice move to progression associated with it. But we do feel good about the business. And again, the key is trying to drive the security technology on a broad base across many applications for the total Company, especially when you begin to think about it on a combined basis. Tore Svanberg And as my follow-up, you mentioned the wireless base station market seems to still be soft and will remain soft. What are some of the data-points to support that? And is there any visibility as to when that market potentially start growing again? Thank you. Peter Kelly So the data points that support that revenue, which continues to be hard to predict, based on the supply chain that’s not easy to call. I think it's -- when you think about the fundamental assumptions, I think, we’re going to continue to see an expansion of data over wireless network. So, you should see fundamentally the ability for base stations to grow. But it's virtually impossible for us to project when that will take place. We continue to be leader in that space, so that’s very positive opportunity for us. It’s a profitable business. As we see the industry moving to more content associated with across the wireless networks, we do think there is some opportunities for the early implementation of 5G, our massive MIMO. They could play a role in increases in revenue in the upcoming quarters. But it's certainly not going to be a factor in the next few quarters. So, we expect that business to continually really hard to predict, but very nice profitability and one that we continue to be a leader in. Tore Svanberg Fair enough. Thank you. Peter Kelly Thanks. Rick Clemmer Well, everyone, thank you very much for attending our call today. We realized it was abbreviated call. But given the announcement first thing this morning, we want to let you guys get back to our new notes and things. We really appreciate all your support. And with that, we'd like to end the call today. Thank you very much. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

Now, I'd like to turn today's call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President. Ken? Ken Bond Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.

As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3, I'll then review guidance for Q4 and then I'll turn the call over to Mark and then Larry. Just so you all know, we're not all in the same place today, so we may all answer at once, so give a chance. Clearly, we are delighted with our results as software and cloud revenue was at the high end of my guidance and earnings per share $0.06, above the high end of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud is now clearly in full strength. We continue to see outside growth rates in our cloud business, especially when compared with our key competitors who're all seeing slowing growth. But more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business has overtaken new software license business decline on an annual basis. Next year I expect our cloud revenue will be larger than our new software license revenue. The investments we've made to transition our business to the cloud has been important to ensure that Oracle remains a technology leader and we're now beginning to see the benefits in our results. With cloud overtaking new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade as a license business that is growing revenue with disciplined cost management that results an EPS and cash flow that grow even faster. I expect EPS growth to ramp up throughout next year. We continue to use constant dollar rates on our quarterly calls, so that we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movement were largely in line with my guidance of 1% currency headwind for revenue, $0.01 negative impact to EPS. Cloud, SaaS, and PaaS revenues for the quarter were $1.1million, up 86% from last year. You can also see the continued strength of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $2 billion, up 75% in U.S. dollars; and SaaS and PaaS billings grew 111% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail. When you add together cloud, SaaS, PaaS revenues, and new software license revenue together, we grew 11% in constant currency. This is a significant milestone in our transformation where the combination of our cloud and new software license businesses added together are growing. As cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the growth will only accelerate with earnings and cash flow following along. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q3 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 65%, up from 51% last year, and I expect it to be about the same region in Q4. I expect that our total Saas and PaaS gross margin will continue to trend toward 80% overtime. Cloud infrastructure as a service revenue was 178 million, up 19% from last year. The Q3 gross margin was 30%, as we continue to make the necessary investments to scale out this business. As we make additional investments, the expenses and immediately while the revenues recognized overtime, so the gross margin in this part of the business could decline to roughly about 20% over the next few quarters. After which, I expect gross margin will climb to more than 40% as the business scales. Total cloud revenue in the quarter was approximately 1.3 billion, with growth modestly accelerating to 72% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were 6.2 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remained at their usual high levels, as our installed base of customers continued to grow, in fact they actually increased. New software license revenues were nearly 1.4 billion, down 15%, reflecting the continued emphasis on and migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support was down 9% with hardware systems product revenue of 520 million and hardware support revenue of $508 million, again reflecting our focus on the move to the cloud. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was 9.3 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was 3.9 billion, up 4% from last year and the operating margin was 43%, up from 42% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.6%, as the rate was favorably impacted by some onetime benefits and some other factors, including favorable geographic mix this quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69 in USD, up from $0.64 and up 8% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 17% and the GAAP EPS was $0.53 in USD, up from $0.50 last year. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was 13.5 billion, which is lower because of the rapid growth we're seeing as we transition to cloud and having an impact on our working capital. Our operational metrics like DSO and Days Payable are stable, so it's just largely an effective growth on working capital and timing. Capital expenditures for Q3 were 440 million with about third of it from real estate, while most of the rest was cloud build out and internal use. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was 11.8 billion. We now have approximately 69 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately 5 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is 7.4 billion, up 7% in constant currency. This quarter, we purchased approximately 30 million shares for a total of 500 million. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 124 million shares for a total of 5 billion and paid out dividends of 2.5 billion. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 27% from $0.15 to $0.19 per share. Now let me go to the guidance. Because we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates, we do also expect to see significant currency headwind. I am going to give you constant currency guidance, but if the current exchange rates remain the same throughout the quarter as they're right now, we actually expect to see currency headwind of 2% on revenue and $0.02 negative impact on EPS. These currency headwinds are higher than last quarter, meaning that most of your Q4 estimates do not yet reflect the incremental revenue and EPS headwinds of an additional negative impact of 1% and $0.01 to EPS. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis. With that my guidance is as follows. SaaS and PaaS revenue including NetSuite is expected to grow 69% to 73%, effectively raising my full year guidance from 80% to 81% for the year. We're beginning to see an increasing and favorable attach between our PaaS and IaaS order. So I'm going to provide guidance on IaaS as well this quarter. IaaS is expected to grow 25% to 29%. Software and cloud revenue including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow 1% to 3%. Total revenue is expected to grow from negative 1 to positive 2. EPS is expected to be between $0.78 and $0.82 in constant currency. Now, this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%, but of course the Q4 tax rate could end up being different. With that I'm going to turn this over to Mark and then Larry follows him. Mark Hurd Alright, thanks Safra. We thought Q3 would be strong going in and as you can see it turned out to be just that. I'm going to give you a bunch of numbers hear and try to give you a little bit more insight to the quarter. First, in ARR, we booked 545 million in USD. Every number I'm going to give you was actually in CD, I want to say it differently. 545 in USD, 547 in CD, that is up 73% and the second best quarter we had ever had. SaaS bookings were 322 million in USD and PaaS infrastructure bookings were 223 in USD. Cloud revenue was up 72% and we're now in an annualized $5 billion run rate. Saas, Paas revenue was up 86%. We're the fastest growing scaled cloud business in the world and that is on top, that growth rate is on top of last year's 60%. In ERP, we were up 280% organically and with NetSuite ERP is now our largest pillar. Fusion HCM was up 106%, that's more than three times the growth rate of Workday. CX was up 16% with marketing and service both over 100 million in quarterly revenue. Our vertical is up for 109% and also over 100 million in quarterly revenue. Database as a Service was up 427%. Our database business including all of our on premise businesses net revenue. PaaS was up 375% year-to-date, with cloud services up 300%. As Safra mentioned Saas, PaaS billings were up 111% in USD, Saas, PaaS deferred revenue was up 75% in USD. Now, some customer metrics, 1,125 new SaaS customers in the quarter, 908 expansions, 210 customers who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. CX, we had 480 new customers and 586 expansions. In HCM, we had 206 new customers and 217 expansions. In ERP, we had 564 new customers that did not include NetSuite; we got 120 expansions. 50% of our new ERP customers never had Oracle ERP before they bought this quarter. Our active base of ERP customers is now approaching 3,700, 1,465 are live, 10X Workday. In total we now have 13,103 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 with NetSuite. Two thirds of our new customer wins were for Fusion. 243 Go-Lives for Fusion, 2,444 customers are now live on Fusion. We have 2,380 PaaS customers in the quarter and 2,586 new customers buying standalone infrastructure as a service. As a point of clarity, PaaS and infrastructure customers accounted for each service that they buy. Lastly, this was an excellent quarter. Bookings, billings and revenue were all extremely solid. Now, a few predictions, Q3 bookings growth was strong, as I mentioned 73%. We will book at least 2 billion in ARR this year. Q3 revenue growth was impressive at 72% and with revenue now and an annualized run rate of 5 billion; we're clearly the fastest growing cloud company at scale. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Larry Ellison Thank you, Mark. Let's say, generation two of Oracle's infrastructure as service cloud now has the ability to run customers' largest databases, something that is impossible to do using Amazon web services. Amazon can only run relatively small Oracle databases in their cloud. Gen 2 of Oracle IaaS also delivers ultra high database performance and form caller reliability in the cloud. Many Oracle workloads now run ten times faster in the Oracle cloud versus the Amazon cloud. It also costs less to run Oracle workloads in the Oracle cloud than the Amazon cloud. As a result some of our largest customers' are negotiating huge infrastructure as a service contracts to move all their databases to the Oracle cloud. You can expect some of those big deals to be announced in the coming weeks. Fast growth in the infrastructure as a service business is new for us. We've done well on SaaS and in PaaS over the past few years, but this is the first time we've ever had a technology lead in infrastructure as a service. We're now in position to help our hundreds of thousands database customers move millions of Oracle databases to our infrastructure as a service cloud. SaaS and PaaS are large, rapidly growing businesses for us. Together SaaS and PaaS grew 85% this past quarter. But soon infrastructure as a service will be growing even faster and before long infrastructure as a service will become Oracle's largest cloud business. In summary, all of Oracle's cloud businesses are growing rapidly and IaaS will be leading the way in the future. Thanks. Ken Bond Thank you, Larry. Holly, if we could prepare the audience for the Q&A portion of the call now. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne Thanks, very much and congrats on a very nice third quarter. My question is for Mark. Mark, obviously a really nice quarter across the board, but particularly from cloud bookings perspective, can you talk about what changed if anything in the quarter versus the second quarter either in terms of the macro backdrop or better execution and just relatedly we'll be interested in what you're seeing in the pipeline that gives you further confidence in that $2 billion ARR target. Thanks. Mark Hurd Kirk, I thought good about Q1, I thought good about Q2, I feel good about Q3, I didn't feel any major change. It's just really the timing of wins, bookings closed. We had a very strong set of quality wins. I mean if you win into HCM, I mean just to give you some idea Kirk, we closed America Movil in the quarter, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Ford, Emerson, Hilton, Hyundai Motor, Jefferies, Rogers Communications, I mean we had a very strong set of logos in the quarter. I mean in ERP, we closed ClubCorp, Cummins, Lufthansa, Dish Network, I mean it was just a - I could go on. I don't have time to tell you all of these deals. But we saw it going in, we felt it would happen. It did and I think our team executed well. I would say Kirk that there was no - it wasn't geographically centered and it was pillar centered. As I mentioned earlier we had credible growth in ERP 280% organically, we had a 106% growth in HCM, we had strong in our sales automation business and it wasn't unique to one geography, so in the quarter broad based, cross pillar, cross geography. In terms of going forward, our pipeline is big. I mean I said before, I'll say it again. Our pipeline's growth, if you looked at it year-over-year resembles all of the growth rates you've heard in terms of what you've seen in terms of our bookings growth this quarter. And I think our execution just continues to get better. I'll also add in the quarter that NetSuite's performance accelerated. So from the last reported quarter in terms of bookings growth, their growth in the quarter, which for them was an odd thing because they're not used to having December, January, February quarter, but when compare it apples-to-apples, they grew faster than the last reported quarter in terms of bookings as well, so it's a very good quarter for us. Kirk Materne Great, thanks very much. Operator Our next question is going to come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan Hi, thank you very much. Mark, you must be wearing a suit and Larry, maybe you're wearing a sweater because you're talking tech and Mark is talking application, so I'm going to direct my applications question to Mark if you don't mind. Mark, can you talk about what's ahead for cloud SaaS, obviously there is manufacturing, order entry, supply chain, those kinds of things that could book to the cloud. How should we think about the cycle ahead in that regard? Thank you very much. Mark Hurd It is a big change for us in ERP. This is not the world of two providers and I was talking about upgrade cycles. What happened to us in ERP and I go back to the fact that 50% of our customers in the quarter were just brand-new. So, they never had bought ERP from us before. Ad what happened is our total available market has just become incredibly large. If you looked at the persona of our customers that are in the ERP cloud today, they were not - most of them, more than 50% of them today were not in Oracle ERP customer her before they bought from us. So, I don't think, cash, it's really more of a cycle. I think it's really more of just an inflection point for us in terms of - we're now at a place where we have almost 4,000 customers in ERP SaaS. Many of our on-prem customers have not moved and yet we're in a position where we can go get a whole set of customers that we never had access to before. Mid-market customers, we can do that globally and we can go now for customers that want to move to a SaaS application in the cloud and get all of those benefits. Frankly, our competitors' user bases have all opened up to us. And so, I don't see it quite as a cycle of that. I see it as a big change in the opportunity for us in terms of the total available market we can go after. Larry may have a comment or two he would like to add as well. Larry Ellison No, again, I couldn't agree with Mark more. Our ability now to service much smaller customers than we could have serviced in the past is because the cloud allows you to deploy ERP in much, much lower costs. You don't have to have ERP. You don't have to build the data center. Obviously, you don't have to hire programmers. You don't have to hire a bunch of data operations people. We do all that for you, and therefore the available market has at least doubled what it used to be. And we're also beginning to see, as Mark said, SAP customers moving their ERP and some very, very large SAP customers looking very closely at our ERP systems. So, we expect to have some big wins in the SAP install base, so we're definitely going out from there in the coming month. Ken Bond Next question, please. Operator And our next question is going to come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital. Raimo Lenschow Hey, thank you and congrats from me as well. I had a question around 12C. So, you have 12C now in the cloud for a good few months and I saw last week that it's now available on-premise. Can you talk a little bit about the early feedback from customers you saw and released to in the cloud and what did it mean - what does it mean now that it's available on-premise? Obviously, in the olden days that kind of spiked a little bit of an uptick in the database license growth, I'm just wondering how we have to think about it now in the new cloud world. Thank you. Larry Ellison I will give you one thing that's important to note that our cloud business, our license business per database is growing. So, our on-prem database business continues to grow. I'm not talking about the board, I'm talking about new licenses. That business is growing and grew this past Q3. An awful lot of our customers are planning to move their database workloads to our cloud, but they're going to bring their own license. In other words, they own a bunch of Oracle license and they're just going to move those licenses to our infrastructure as a service. So, we expect our database license business to continue to grow. That should continue to respond kind of as it had in the past. In other words, the cool new features become available faster in memory processing, the ability to take an existing single tenant application and automatically turn into a multi-tenant application to be very attractive to our customers and our ISDs, they will buy more licenses, they may then in turn bring those licenses to the cloud. So, we expect our on-premise or better said, our database license business to continue to grow and accelerate because of 12. Raimo Lenschow Perfect. Thank you. Mark Hurd Just as a follow-up because I know what Larry meant, it's our database business grew, support plus license plus database as a service, those three categories together, our database business grew in the quarter. Next question? Operator Our next question is going to come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow Hey, thanks guys and congrats on a great quarter. I really wanted to focus on in particular on the PaaS line, because obviously you guys put up a huge ARR quarter there. Safra, you mentioned increasing the PaaS, sort of IaaS to PaaS, part of our thesis has been, since you rolled out the new Datacenter 2.0 model on IaaS, that increasing attach there would then drive acceleration in the PaaS business. So, the question to, I guess, all three of you and I'll jump off, is what are you seeing since the announcement of - you had opened world on the IaaS side and how is that impacting? How do you expect it to impact the PaaS business? Mark Hurd Well, I mean, Phil, there is a lot of questions you had in one question there. So, I mean I think the point we've continued to try to indicate is that we've seen a continual connect first PaaS to SaaS. So, we've got a bunch of SaaS customers who typically buy an application and now we're starting to get up into where we see 20%, 25% connectivity. When somebody buys the SaaS application, they buy PaaS. I think part of what we're talking about with attach with infrastructure is it becomes a bit harder to differentiate in some cases what is a pure infrastructure and what is PaaS, because the customer now buys the computer, buys the computing, buys the storage, et cetera along with PaaS and so you begin to get upward and to a degree of the infrastructure business and the database business, but no question about it. We continue to see the attach rates continue to incline of PaaS to our SaaS business, which I think was your - at the core of your first question, Phil. Philip Winslow Yeah, sort of the [indiscernible]. Safra Catz Yes. For our database customers, when they come in, they can order PaaS. They can bring or they can bring their licenses, use IAS and as a general matter when they are running a database where they got something else too and so they're going to need some IAS to actually run their application when they're not our SaaS application. So, we're seeing these together very often. And so, I figured as we've now moved - as we're moving to our more advanced IAS from what you used to have, I thought I would break it out for you to see it. Philip Winslow Great, thanks, guys. Safra Catz Okay. Ken Bond Operator Our next question is going to come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies and Company. John DiFucci Thank you. My question is for Safra. Safra, you've previously talked about double-digit constant currency earnings growth for next year. You had meaningful outperformance this quarter and your guide was better than where the street is. I guess you also mentioned in your prepared remarks about EPS ramping through next year. I guess just to clarify, do you expect to still achieve double-digit growth? And is that exiting the year it'll be double-digit growth or are you talking about for the entire year? Safra Catz So, I expect that when you look at the entire year, it will be double-digit growth, but it will start smaller and get bigger as we get through the year. So, Q1, I don't know right now. It's a little too early. We'll talk again as to what I'm going to see. Things look nice. But I'm going to - we'll talk again in June on Q1. And I think by the end of the year, the only question is, which quarter would drive into double-digit? And it's a little too early to tell but I expect to see it for the year. John DiFucci Okay, okay. Great and just if I could a quick follow-up on a related profitability note, the one thing in the results this quarter was cash flow actually declined from a year ago, I think, this quarter. You mentioned in your prepared remarks working capital and timing issues. Can you just provide a little more detail on what you mean by that? Safra Catz Yeah. I mean there is really nothing in it. It is pretty much just timing of when we paid stuff and things like that. I mean we would be filing our Q, our plan is to filing on Friday. You can spend the weekend digging through it. We dug through. There is nothing interesting going on whatsoever. We're growing and it's really just timing of different working capital impacting account, really nothing in particular. John DiFucci Okay, great. Looking forward to that weekend. Thank you. Ken Bond Next question, please. Operator Our next question is going to come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss Thank you guys, for taking my question and a nice quarter. A new one for Larry just to clarify sort of the positioning on infrastructure as a service, when we think about sort of Gen 2 offering, is the positioning a platform for your customers to run workloads primarily or was it just more of a general purpose platform that you expect to go head on with AWS and Azure for general purpose type workloads? Mark Hurd It's absolutely a general purpose workload, because Oracle database is a backend. We have no idea what that application might be. It could be on our backing application. It could be our DNA, basically our matching application. There are millions or tens of millions of Oracle applications running. They're going to have to move the infrastructure as a service and the backend will probably run all the databases in PaaS, but we have to have a completely generalized infrastructure as a service offering that we built and we think we have performance and cost advantages with our new Gen 2 over both Amazon and Azure. Keith Weiss Excellent, thank you. Operator And our next question is going to come from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian Great, thank you so much and congratulations on the quarter, I would love Safra, if you could give us an early indication or any potential impact do you expect on the business model from SaaS B and IaaS B initiating new revenue recognition policies. Whatever you are seeing or thinking there that we should be starting to think about would be helpful. Safra Catz Sure, for us it's no big deal actually. It's really very much a non-event. I do hear one of our competitors talking all sorts of stuff about it. No, stuff for us to minimize [ph]. Maybe they're trying to talk about something else, but in our case we're not actually early adopting, but it doesn't make a difference really. Zero impact whatsoever on cash flows and no impact on what we disclosed to you or any of the things that these other companies talking about. For us it's really nothing. Sarah Hindlian Alright, thank you. That's very helpful. Operator Okay. And our final question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini Great, thank you so much for taking the question. Just one is actually for Larry. I was wondering if you can share with us, it does appear that the company is coming to an inflection point in regards to your transition of the cloud and given the results from today and your commentary about Q4 and the earnings growth for next year, how long do you think this could run? Larry Ellison Well, we have a very, very large database business. We have hundreds of thousands of database customers and we have millions and millions of applications that run on the Oracle database. Most of those databases and most of those customers will move most of their databases and most of these workloads to the cloud. And we think our cloud will be - right now we have a huge technology lead over both Amazon and Azure with our new Generation 2 infrastructure as a service. We can deliver ultrahigh performance. People have been buying these Exadata Database Machines and are getting used to running very large databases very, very fast and we can deliver comparable ultrahigh performance at very, very low cost in our cloud. So, we think how long does it take to migrate several hundred thousand customers and several million databases to the Oracle cloud and I think the rate of migration is going to accelerate over the years, but it's going to be at least a five-year run of very, very rapid growth as our database business begins to move. You've seen what it's like. Our application business began to move to the cloud several years ago and - but that's a little bit different. I mean we built all new application and they migrated from an old application, either an SAP application or an old PeopleSoft application or E-Business Suite and they migrated to our new Fusion ERP suite. That's a very different than simply lifting up an Oracle database workload and moving it over to Oracle. The application goes to infrastructure as a service and then the database goes to platform as a service. That's the faster process, but a much larger install base. Again my estimate is that business will move over - the majority will move over the next five years and that's going to give us enormous growth rates over that five-year period. Heather Bellini Thank you. Operator Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Ken Bond for closing comments. Ken Bond Thank you everybody and thank you Holly.

Kirk Materne Thanks, very much and congrats on a very nice third quarter. My question is for Mark. Mark, obviously a really nice quarter across the board, but particularly from cloud bookings perspective, can you talk about what changed if anything in the quarter versus the second quarter either in terms of the macro backdrop or better execution and just relatedly we'll be interested in what you're seeing in the pipeline that gives you further confidence in that $2 billion ARR target. Thanks. Mark Hurd Kirk, I thought good about Q1, I thought good about Q2, I feel good about Q3, I didn't feel any major change. It's just really the timing of wins, bookings closed. We had a very strong set of quality wins. I mean if you win into HCM, I mean just to give you some idea Kirk, we closed America Movil in the quarter, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Ford, Emerson, Hilton, Hyundai Motor, Jefferies, Rogers Communications, I mean we had a very strong set of logos in the quarter. I mean in ERP, we closed ClubCorp, Cummins, Lufthansa, Dish Network, I mean it was just a - I could go on. I don't have time to tell you all of these deals. But we saw it going in, we felt it would happen. It did and I think our team executed well. I would say Kirk that there was no - it wasn't geographically centered and it was pillar centered.
