Operator Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices First Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Great. Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the Analog Device's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules and the CFO commentary at investor.analog.com. With me on today's call are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Dave Zinsner. So before we start, let's get through some disclosures. Please note the information we're about to discuss including our objectives, outlook and the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. With the exception of revenue, our commentary about ADI's first quarter financial results will exclude special items which, in the aggregate, totaled $85 million for the quarter. When comparing our first quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in Schedules E and F in today's earnings release which we have posted at investor.analog.com. So with that, let's get started and I'll turn the call over to Vince. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks very much, Ali, and good morning, everyone. So by any measure, our January quarter results were stellar. Revenue of $984 million was well above the high-end of our guidance, growing 28% over the prior year, and we had broad strength across all our markets. And we expanded operating margins over 700 basis points from the prior year to 35% of sales. Earnings per share of $0.94 was up 68% from the prior year, and $0.16 better than the high-end of our guidance. Importantly, we have generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months. So this was a terrific start to the fiscal year and we continue to see momentum in our business and in our customer engagements. Our R&D efforts are squarely focused on the most exciting trends in the industrial, automotive, communications infrastructure, healthcare and consumer markets. And I'd like to give you just a few examples of where ADI's technology is making a real difference. So in the area of data converters, which are in many ways the backbone of our mixed-signal franchise, for example, where we're the market leader, we've once again established new performance benchmarks with our next generation of high-speed ADCs and DACs that exploit 28 nanometer CMOS technology combined with proprietary architectures and algorithms. By providing four times improvement in critical high dynamic range parameters, these converter platforms are enabling the next wave of gigahertz bandwidth, software defined systems for 4G and 5G communications, for test equipment and also in several aerospace and defense applications. It's the radio or radar equivalent of going from watching television using the old bunny ears to watching high-definition TV. We can now give our customers the ability to see things that they did not know were even there, and this is a real game-changer. In addition, our previously introduced high-speed signal processing platforms achieved record revenue based on our integrated transceiver platforms, which helped our communications infrastructure customers and beyond efficiently address the challenges of accelerating global data consumption. These solutions are equally well-suited to and are increasingly finding their way into a diversity of applications in the industrial instrumentation, aerospace and defense, and indeed the automotive markets. In factory automation, our software configurable input/output solutions are enabling our customers to create flexible and agile platforms that can be readily expanded and reconfigured to support more sensing and control channels on automated factory floors. In addition, in motor control and robotics applications, our measurement, control and isolation products are driving improvements in motor efficiency, precision and reliability, while maintaining the highest levels of safety and industrial robustness. ADI's healthcare solutions span both B2B and consumer applications. On the B2B side, we're enabling higher channel counts and throughput in high-performance imaging systems that lower our customers' overall cost per channel but importantly drive higher ADI content per system. And on the consumer side of healthcare, our vital signs monitoring technology is enabling highly accurate and ultra-low-power measurements of critical health parameters, improving personal wellness and overall quality of life for the end consumer. Healthcare for ADI is now a high-growth business with its annualized growth rate running in the double digits. In automotive, our 77 gigahertz RF CMOS radar solution offers a robust platform for ADAS and autonomous driving, giving customers the ability to capture objects earlier, more reliably and with greater precision, and over much longer distances. And our investments in cost-effective, high-performing silicon-based LIDAR solutions are turbocharging our efforts in this area. These are the types of innovations that ADI is bringing to the market to better serve our customers' needs, and our industry and the market is taking notice indeed. In recognition of our overall innovation efforts, ADI received the 2017 IEEE Innovation Award and was once again selected by Thomson Reuters as one of the 100 most innovative companies in the world. It has been said that innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower, and ADI is very much at the cutting edge of innovation. This value forms the bedrock of our company's culture and belief system, and is shared equally by Linear Technology. So with that, let me give you a brief update on the status of the proposed acquisition of LTC. Thus far, we have received six out of seven regulatory approvals needed to close the transaction, and our integration planning teams have been hard at work to combine the best of both ADI and Linear Tech in order to present one face to the customer on day one. I also am delighted that Bob Swanson, the Founder and Chief – the Executive Chairman of Linear Tech plans to join ADI's board after the deal closes. So we're all very excited about the combination of ADI and Linear Tech, which we believe will create an analog industry powerhouse that will accelerate innovation and revenue growth opportunities in our core markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets, which indeed are the most lucrative markets in our industry. The transaction is expected to be highly accretive to ADI's non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow. And it makes ADI the number one or number two player in all the major analog product categories, enabling us to solve our customers' analog system problems from end to end. So overall, this was a remarkable quarter across multiple dimensions and we see the momentum continuing into the second quarter. So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ali for some more details on our performance by end market in the quarter just passed. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Great. Thanks, Vince. So just digging deeper in our results by end market, the industrial market was 41% of revenue. It increased 1% sequentially, which was really very strong in what's typically a much seasonal and slower first quarter compared to the fourth. We didn't really see much of a slowdown over the holidays, and I'd say January order rates were also very strong. Within the industrial business, industrial instrumentation applications outperformed our expectations, and I'll highlight the ATE market as one that was particularly strong. And also the factory automation sector within industrial had a very good quarter. Compared to the prior year, the industrial market showed considerable strength. It grew 15% and really was broad-based strength across all of the industrial sectors, so that's a very good result. On the automotive side, the automotive market at 14% of sales was also better than seasonal. It decreased really only slightly from the prior quarter, but grew a very strong 10% over the prior year, led by really content-rich applications such as infotainment, powertrain and ADAS. On the communications infrastructure side, revenue there in that market was 18% of sales. Again, it was also ahead of expectations, increased slightly sequentially, and was up 4% over the prior year, led by optical networking. The consumer market was 27% of sales in the first quarter. It decreased 8% sequentially, which was much better than seasonality, as we saw continued strength in portable consumer applications. And consumer more than doubled over the prior year in the first quarter. So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the first quarter and our guidance for next quarter. With the exception of revenue, Dave's comments on the P&L line items are on a non-GAAP basis. So, Dave, it's all yours. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Ali. Fiscal 2017 starts out on solid footing, with ADI delivering very strong revenue, profitability, earnings per share and free cash flow. Revenue in the first quarter, as we mentioned, totaled $984 million, and diluted earnings per share was $0.94. Gross margins at 66.1% were above our guidance on a better mix of business and higher revenues. Inventory, on a dollars basis, decreased $11 million sequentially and days of inventory were within our model range at 101 days, down from 105 days in the prior quarter. Utilization rates in the first quarter were in the high 60s and we're planning to increase utilization to the mid-70s in the second quarter. Weeks of inventory in distribution were lean at approximately seven weeks, which was consistent with the prior quarter. During the quarter, we recorded a $49 million restructuring charge primarily related to a voluntary early retirement program for certain U.S. employees. Excluding this and other special items, operating expenses increased 7% sequentially, with the entirety of the increase tied to our variable compensation program, which is based on year-over-year revenue growth and operating margin metrics. Nevertheless, operating margins at 35% of sales expanded over 700 basis points compared to the prior year on strong revenue growth and prudent expense management by the team. Other expense in the first quarter was approximately $26 million. The result of a partial quarter with the permanent financing related to the Linear Tech acquisition in place, we expect our net interest expense to be approximately $30 million per quarter until we close the Linear Tech acquisition. Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 8%, which we expect will be our tax rate until we close, again, on the acquisition. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share increased 68% over the prior year to $0.94, as I said. The first quarter was also a strong free cash flow quarter. We generated $286 million in free cash flow, which was an increase of 46% over the prior year. And over the past 12 months, ADI has grown free cash flow 20% to $1.2 billion or 34% of sales. Capital additions in the first quarter totaled $28 million, and we're planning for the capital additions in 2017 to be in the range of $130 million to $145 million. In line with our shareholder value creation strategy, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share, which represents an annual dividend increase to $1.80 per share. Now turning to our outlook and expectations for the second quarter of 2017, which, with the exception of revenue expectations, is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes known special items that are outlined in today's release. After a record-setting first quarter revenue performance, which was also well above the high end of our guidance range, we're planning for the B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure, in the aggregate, to grow in the mid to high digits sequentially in the second quarter and to increase in the high single-digits over the prior year. In consumer, we're expecting that normal seasonal patterns will prevail and that this business will likely decrease between 40% and 50% sequentially. Nevertheless, we expect consumer to be up significantly over the prior year in the second quarter. In the aggregate, we're planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $870 million to $950 million, which at the midpoint represents year-over-year revenue growth of 17% and would represent the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth. Gross margins are expected to increase to be between approximately 66.5% and approximately 67% on higher utilization rates and a more favorable mix. We estimate that operating expenses will be down approximately 3% to up approximately 1% sequentially in the second quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding any special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.86, which at the midpoint would represent very strong year-over-year earnings per share growth of about 25%. So to wrap it up, the first quarter was a very good start to the year. We had a strong year-on-year revenue growth with quality earnings and cash generation, and we expect this momentum to continue into the second quarter. So with that, we'll take any questions you have. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Great. Thanks, Dave. And so just a reminder for folks on the line, please limit yourself to one question. And again, if you have a follow-up question, we ask that you re-queue. And again, we do this in the spirit of fairness so that everybody on the call gets to ask at least one of their questions. So, operator, it's all yours. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting ask a question. Congratulations on the strong results. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Guys, relative to your initial guidance, the big upside in the Jan quarter came out of consumer. Just kind of curious what changed throughout the quarter? Was this really just kind of a better mix with your large consumer customer where that would give you more content on a larger screen? And as you think about kind of the opportunity of that customer, how do we think about content going into the back half of this calendar year? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. So, yeah, I would say that in general, with the consumer customer, sometimes it's hard to totally predict kind of the weekly shipment level through the entire quarter, and so we make an estimate based on what we think will turn through the quarter plus what we come into the quarter with backlog. And there's varying scenarios, I would say, related to how that would go, and this was obviously the most optimistic scenario. So it just turned out better. I would point out though that we didn't expect nearly the strength we saw in the B2B markets either, and so they contributed to the upside as well. So we're really happy that every end market did a bit better than expectation. So that was awesome. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. So just to add to what Dave has said there, John, we, as you know, have been working hard to diversify our position and decrease dependence on any single socket. And we have more content in these applications today than we had this time last year, so that certainly helps as well. So we've got more ASP per system, and we continue on the track of diversifying to get more and more sockets in that area. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right, John. Thanks for the question. Next caller, please. Operator Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Tore? Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Congratulations on the strong results. It looks like you announced a new distribution agreement overnight. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that? And maybe this is an opportunity to just talk about the strategy in disty going forward. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so we've had a three decade relationship with the distribution – maybe 25 years with the distribution channel in general. And what we're striving to do, Tore, fundamentally, is we're trying to deepen the level of support and give a better breadth of service for our customers, we have many tens of thousands of customers. So the channel plays an important role, I think, in the broad breadth of logistics, services across the entire suite of customers and, particularly, with the smaller customers, providing a lot of design service. So basically, we've decided to simplify the structure to enable us to bring the level of support that we desire. And we expect basically to be able to leverage the more focused channel team that we've got and essentially draw on a more comprehensive suite of, in a more focused way, end to end support services that could range from design, design help, also prototyping and of course logistics support over the long term. So we're also – we've been investing for all our customers, big and small, over the last several years, by bringing on more direct resource and really understanding the role of the channel. So we're in a good place right now. And of course, when we combine with LTC, we will also have the opportunity to bring more field applications and sales resource to a broader breadth of customers. So overall it's about – it's part of our fundamental strategy which is about innovation, diversity and operation efficiency, and the moves we're making here play to all three of those facets of our business model. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Tore. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Very helpful. Thank you. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Great. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Tore. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Next caller? Operator Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montreal. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi. Thank you very much. Thanks for the update on Linear, Vince. And, Dave, last quarter you had given us an update on the accretion and the tax rate. Now that you've spent quite a fair bit of time in rainy California, I was just wondering how should we think about the top line? And where I was going with this was, at CES, we had some early view on how a go-to-market would look like on a board with Linear and with ADI in a auto (20:26) example. So question is really when should we be expecting it to show up and in what end market should it show up first? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, I would say we get more and more enthusiastic about the opportunities for combining technologies of Linear and ADI every time we meet together as a team. We have kind of loosely built in some expectation that we will get several hundred million dollars worth of revenue synergies with the combined business. Some of that will take some time. I think a lot of it's going to be in areas where the design cycles and the time to revenue is quite long. So it might be out in the 2024, 2025 timeframe where you really start to see us hit our stride. But within the first few years, we'll start to hit and see some revenue synergies and I would point out, that's kind of similar to the path we're on right now with Hittite. We're starting to see it trickle in a little bit in the early stages. We certainly have seen it build up in the opportunity pipeline for the subsequent years here. So we just get, I think, every time we meet, more optimistic about what we can do as a company in terms of delivering technology. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Most of the business of LT and ADI combined is targeted at the core markets of B2B, so we see opportunity. I think at CES you saw how ADAS, for example, combines the power technology of LTC with the mixed-signal technology and RF technology of ADI. But we have examples of that in the industrial automation, the instrumentation, the aerospace and defense. So basically, everywhere we play, including communications infrastructure where ADI is much stronger on the wireless side, LT is stronger on the wired side. There's good symbiosis between the companies, particularly in the B2B space. And I think the first couple of years of the combination of ADI and LTC are really about how well together we take the pipeline of opportunity that's at unprecedented levels in terms of size at this point in time and convert that pipeline and service the heck out of our customers. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. I'd also point out that just on the expense side, as we've had time to solidify the plans there, I think we feel very, very confident about our $150 million expense synergy. I talked about this kind of restructuring charge we took this quarter related to this voluntary retirement. Part of that is to kind of make some room as we integrate the Linear Tech people within the company. So in the 10-Q, it talks about a $28 million savings for just the salary and fringe related to those employees. But we find that there's some extraneous savings like travel and so forth that also are reduced. So I think we have made a pretty meaningful down payment on the $150 million already in advance of even integrating and then, of course, the public company expenses go away pretty quickly too, and that's $20 million, $25 million of expense. So we are very confident now having worked on this and really penciled it out that the $150 million is very achievable. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you, guys. Good luck. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Ambrish. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yes. Thanks. Dave, you piqued my interest on the Hittite revenue synergy side. Can you give a little bit more detail or anecdotes in terms of some of the things you're seeing from a design or revenue ramp perspective on Hittite? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, Vince will probably do a better job of this. But I would tell you that in areas like aerospace and defense where they were particularly strong, we have pulled a lot of ADI content onto those systems and subsystems. That's been a big win for us. I think we did not appreciate how much opportunity we had in the aerospace and defense area until we really acquired Hittite and had that opportunity. There's a lot of radar capability that's required for the automotive space and we're taking a lot of the capability we got from Hittite to be able to drive into that. The next generation which we've talked about in the past is 77 GHz for ADAS, and I think a lot of the capability that we've pulled in from Hittite has helped in that regard. Also, I think that Hittite really just didn't have an opportunity to really address the larger OEMs given their size. Around the edges, they might have won a little bit of business but they really weren't breaking into those OEMs in any meaningful way. That's all changed since they became part of ADI, and these are $10 million, $20 million, $30 million opportunities if you do them right. So I think we estimate that we probably have filled in the pipeline to the tune of $100 million of opportunities because of having the two entities combined that we would not have won otherwise. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so we were running, at the time of acquisition of Hittite, which was just about two and a half years ago now, the revenue stream was roughly $70 million a quarter. So we're running on a percentage basis at a substantially higher level than that right now. And I think to add to what Dave has said, the conversation with our customers has changed over that period of time. I think Hittite and ADI have gone from being very potent component-level suppliers to really now being able to architect our customer systems in these new, for example, digitally-oriented beam steering systems for radar, for mobile communications infrastructure. We're very much now working at the application level in rather than the component level out. So I think it's been really a win-win. And as our customers in the analog space in general are dealing with thinner and thinner levels of resource and capability in terms of engineering their analog solutions, we're very, very well positioned. Hittite helps enormously on the RF and microwave side of things, and LT will help us on the analog systems side with the power side of things primarily. So that's I think how to look at it. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Got it. Thanks. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Craig. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hey. Thanks, guys. Considering the upside in the January quarter and then the guidance for the April quarter, what should we be thinking about conceptually for seasonal revenue growth in the July quarter? And then maybe give us your expectations, if only relative, for the four basic food groups of end markets for revenue growth this year. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, seasonally, usually sequentially, the third quarter is up. You tend to see a stronger consumer environment and the rest of the markets either are up or flattish. And then the fourth quarter, generally, is sequentially up again pretty meaningfully because you really start to see the consumer hit. I'd almost say in this case, we love all our children equally. I mean, I think every end market has the opportunity to grow meaningfully from the prior year. We'll have to see how the rest of the year kind of shakes out, but we start off in a great situation. Our expectations for the second quarter as we look at our backlog, look really good. So this continues into the third and fourth quarter, I think every end market is going to do pretty well for us. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Chris. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congrats on the quarter. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Hi. Thank you. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Question on the consumer side. It's clearly been better than your expectations. Could you just talk about how do you think about the segment over the next 12 months in terms of portables versus the rest of the consumer opportunity you have? And I think this gen (29:03) with your largest customer, you had talked about picking up 30% more content. Do you think that's possible again as they go through, I guess, a super-cycle product for the next year or do you see opportunity with your largest customer more in sync with the unit trajectory they have? Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, our consumer business is really a tale of two stories. We have prosumer, which is a more – it's a business more akin to a B2B type dynamic. So with many customers, many, many very high performance building blocks from DSP to mixed-signal in areas like audio and video signal processing. So we saw some downturn of that business over the last couple of years, but we've kind of hit the bottom. We believe we're at an inflection point there. So that's at least giving us stability. And that's kind of the bedrock of our consumer business in many ways. And so we're at an inflection there. On the portable side of things, we're clearly in a much better position than we were a year ago. We're working hard, as I said earlier, to diversify to get more sockets and things like the image processing control system, sensing in general. And also, we're engaging with many more customers than we did, I should say, on a pretty constrained, highly-leveraged R&D budget. So look, is it possible that we get another 30% increase? Of course it is, and that's what we're working hard to do, to make sure we grab all available high-quality sockets that our technology is well matched to. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking the question, guys, and congratulations on the strong results. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC You're welcome. I wanted to follow up on a couple of the segment dynamics, and first, just looking at industrial and communications. Industrial looks like it's at record revenues, at least in my model, and it seems like there should still be some incremental strength that would come from areas like energy extraction, which I suspect may not be as strong as it's been in the past. And on communications, the business has been barely stable for the last four quarters. Is the strength that you're seeing now leading to a more material increase versus trailing fourth quarter levels or are we really just seeing a seasonal bump and nothing more than that? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. Let me take a shot at it. I'm sure Vince will provide better color than I can give. But I would say you're right in that the industrial business, I think, did hit a record this quarter, which is interesting and the fact that it happened in a first quarter, which tends not to be the strongest industrial quarter for us. So we'll likely hit an even bigger record next quarter in the second quarter, since we expect it to be sequentially up. I think it had kind of a relatively pedestrian last year and maybe not as strong as we would've liked to see it. There was a few things on the macro side that impacted it. I think those have abated, and when you look at every subcategory within the industrial space, all of them are showing good strength. So I think that while it's early and we're always cautious about this, it does look like it's moving into a period of time where we start to see some meaningful growth. And quite honestly we should. We've made a lot of investments in the market, and there are a lot of opportunities for analog content. And so I think we're starting to see the benefits of a lot of development over a lot of years. On the communications side, that business had been up. It came back down quite a bit in the prior periods. It had somewhat stabilized in the back half of last year, and we're in kind of what I think is a relatively stable period. Having said that, I do think there's a lot of opportunity in the comm infrastructure space for us. We have this new transceiver – integrated transceiver that I think is doing quite well. I think we will see our performance on the wireless side be relatively better on the macro side than some of the competition. On top of that, we think that this small cell deployment that has been long advertised and late to the party seems to have really started to gain some momentum here. And so we do expect to see some real traction in 2017 from that. And then lastly, an area that tends not to get as much focus is our wireline business. And with this kind of 100G deployments – 100 gig deployments that are going on right now, we're benefiting from that. And so our wireline business actually did particularly well this quarter. And so I think there's some expectation that for the next – rest of the year it will do quite well. So I don' know exactly how the year will totally shake out yet, we always lack a bit of visibility out beyond the quarter. But I think the fact that it was pretty solid in the first quarter and we're expecting a reasonably good second quarter leads us to believe it'll be a pretty good year for the comms business. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, something we don't talk an awful lot about in our wired business as well is cable infrastructure. And a lot of our new mixed-signal and data converter technologies are enabling the carriers there to realize 4K/8K video. And without our technology, it is impossible, and to be able to do it within constrained physical space as well as power budgets. So that's an area that's doing very, very well for ADI in the signal path along with, as Dave said, in the optical control chain. So I think our wired business is poised – as long as the markets behave well, our wireline business is poised for, I think, very decent growth in the years ahead. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Craig. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks very much. You mentioned you've got six of the seven clearances you need for the Linear deal. Can you remind us which the six are and what the seventh is you're waiting on, and update of when you expect the deal to close? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. I'll butcher the six, so let me just tell you the one that we don't have. We certainly have the U.S. We have all the Europe ones. We have all of Asia except for one, which is China. So we're waiting for China to approve it. I think it's well documented that that's a long process, which is why we expected this thing to close around the end of April is because we knew that that would be a long process. It's going very well. They do ask for a lot of information, and we have to go back and pull the stuff together, present it in a way that is in the format in which they want to see it. And so we think it's going fine, and we would expect that we are on schedule to close this by the end of April at this point. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Great. Thanks. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Sure. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, David. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on the great results. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch My question is, Vince, on the automotive segment. It's very good to see the sales acceleration over the last couple of quarters despite, I know in the past, you've had some headwind in some products. But when I look at some of your analog peers, say Texas Instruments, they grew their auto business by 20% last year. So my question is when do you think those legacy headwinds will start to abate and you can close the growth gap with some of your peer group? Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, we're – better and better positions with our customers and across the various applications. But just for the record, our infotainment business grew in double digits over the past year, as did much of our powertrain and battery control technologies as well. So some of our segments have performed well in the double digit area. I think we've talked before very openly about the fact that we've withdrawn from parts of the MEMS-based safety market, but we still have an important role to play particularly with very, very high-end inertial and gyro-sensing technologies for active safety control. And our ADAS technology continues – the RF and microwave technology there continues to do very, very well, and we're very excited by the 77-gig technology that we're bringing to market as well that we showcased at CES. And that's a whole new level of performance that we're bringing to market there with 77-gig. So I think we're better and better positioned. We're doing a lot more business in Asia than we used to do. And so that kind of evens out the distribution or the diversity of our business across the globe. So those are the facts and we continue to invest heavily in the space because we think it is a growth driver for many, many years to come for ADI. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. And I would tell you that Linear Tech's technology in the battery management system is quite good, and they have seen growth probably in excess of 20% probably in certain years. So I think that we bring that into the fold, that certainly will help just organically drive the growth, but also we should get some pretty good synergies. Where they have good customer traction is in places where we don't, and vice versa. So I think we'll be able to pull each other into customers and engagements that we don't have today. So it should be, I think, a really good growth driver for us going forward. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Vivek. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask a question about gross margins. In the quarter in the guide and then also a little bit longer term, I was surprised in the January quarter that it was as strong as it was given that the consumer side was so strong. So I would have thought mix, all else being equal, would have been a little bit of headwind. And then the inverse, I thought, would've been true in the April quarter where the combination of mix being a tailwind and you just said utilization was going to rise, I thought that might actually lead to a little more upside. So that's kind of the near-term part of the question, if you could give details on that. And then the longer-term one, if we just put Linear and ADI's gross margins together, talk about the deltas above and below that, synergy values, anything else you can capture that makes it more than just one plus one. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. So let's start with this quarter. Well, I would say that if you remember through all of last year, 2016, we kept utilization relatively in check and really worked the inventories down because we really wanted to get the days down below 110 days, and we did achieve that by the end of the year. So like normally coming into the first quarter, we're not as well positioned in terms of inventory levels. And so we end up having to bring utilization down pretty meaningfully in the first quarter, and that didn't happen. So that ended up kind of helping the gross margins. On top of that, the industrial business just did really well through the whole quarter, and so there was really hardly any reason to kind of crank down the fabs in any meaningful way. The mix part, it actually did impact us a little but I would tell you that, that particular piece of business actually has pretty good gross margins, comparatively speaking, relative to other consumer companies out there. And so it's not quite the headwind when we get it and it's not quite the tailwind when it goes away that you might expect. It might impact it 20 basis points or something. For the second quarter, as you point out, we should have a little bit better mix and we are bringing up the utilization, although kind of modestly, we'll probably be in kind of the mid-70s. There's obviously – if the mix goes where the consumer kind of comes down as meaningfully as I said, 40% to 50%, and we do get to the kind of mid-70s kind of gross margins, it's possible that we would be at the really high end of that range. And we'd be up to the 67% range. So that's obviously a scenario. I think we're just hedging ourselves a little bit just in case we can't quite crank the utilization up to those levels, because it does require us to – well, we have the equipped capacity. We still have to crank through the wafers and sometimes that takes a little while to get cranking. Okay. Oh, on the longer-term side. Yeah, Ross, sorry about that. So then I think on a blended basis, we're kind of in the high 60s gross margins just kind of out of the gate. And then about $50 million of the near-term synergies that we're expecting will be in the gross margin line. So we should expect to get into the 70% range pretty easily, I think, with the near-term synergies identified. Honestly, I think longer-term we have the potential to get into low the 70s for gross margins. We will get some – we inherit some processes from Linear Technology that I think are quite strong. I think that will help out in the entire business. I think we will, over time, get more and more efficient in terms of our manufacturing spending. And so I think that will be beneficial to the gross margin line as well. And of course, I think as Vince had talked a lot about, we are really focused in this B2B space and just quite honestly, because of the design cycles and the technology required to deliver what those customers want, it just carries better gross margins. And so I think we will benefit from that as well. So we're optimistic we can get the gross margins into the low 70s. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Ross. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Good morning, and congratulations on the solid execution. On the aerospace and defense, obviously, that drives very good diversification within your business. Fundamentals here appear to be fairly solid. I think there're some pretty large radar, some sat com programs that are firing both in defense and in the commercial sectors. I know you guys talked a little bit about the synergies from Hittite, but just wondering in general, how is the A&D sub-segment tracking, growth-wise, on a year-over-year basis relative to the sort of 10% to 15% growth trend in the industrial segment now? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so I'll just take the last question first. So it's been growing, obviously, at a very healthy clip over the last year or two in kind of the high single digits. I'd say in this quarter, it was probably in kind of the mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. And then the rest the question was what, exactly? Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC How do you guys see this business going for the full year? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Oh. Oh, for the full year this year? Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Probably in that range. I think this is kind of a multiple of GDP kind of growth. It'll be very correlated to how GDP grows. So probably mid to high single digits. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great. Thanks a lot. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Sure. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and I'll echo the congrats on the results. I just wanted to follow up on a question. The B2B business is growing high single digits. If you take out comm, it's more like double digits. You've seen a lot of your analog peers see similar, and it's really a function of the kind of really no seasonality and then kind of growing off that base. Just give us your perspective on the broader markets here as you talk to customers. Why is this market tracking at these double digits? And how do you see that affecting seasonality as you go through the year? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, I'll talk macro and then I'm sure Vince talks to all of these customers, so he can probably give you some more specific color. But I think last year, it didn't grow that much, and so part of it is just rebounding off of a much slower environment in 2016. So I don't think it's altogether surprising that we would see it start to come back. I would tell you though that I think we have – earlier in the period in which people have been focusing on this, back in the 2009, maybe even 2008, before I even got here timeframe, we really did focus our R&D efforts largely in this space. And I think we made it fairly public that we moved a lot of our consumer R&D into the B2B space to really focus on that market and particularly the industrial markets. And so eventually all that development does translate into revenue, as promised. And so I think some of what you're seeing in the results this quarter is that, it's the opportunities starting to translate into revenue more than anything. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, also, while America and Europe are very, very important, they're the bedrock, if you like, of our B2B business, we've been particularly pleased on the industrial side with the growth in our business in Asia as well over the last two or three quarters. So it's broad based and strong in Europe and America, but even stronger on a growth basis in Asia at this point in time. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. The one thing that helps us get some confidence around this – I don't want to oversell it just yet because one quarter doesn't make a pattern – but as you look out in terms of the inventory, particularly using disties as a proxy, it's actually fairly lean at seven weeks. In fact we normally run seven and a half to eight weeks. And for the last, I don't know, maybe four or five quarters, we've been down at this seven-week level and we haven't seen a build. So that's good because that's getting consumed in various regions, particularly in Asia. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Also, if you look at the PMIs of the big CapEx spending economies, they've been strong and strengthening over the last several quarters. So that certainly helps the B2B business. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Great. Thanks, Blayne. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Next question. Operator And your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats, especially on the strength in industrial in the quarter. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. I had a question about the Linear Tech pending acquisition, and it relates to the biggest concern I hear from investors, which is that there's a view that there are significant cultural differences between the two companies. I'm wondering what you've learned as you've built the plan to integrate the two businesses about the differences and similarities culture-wise and what you see as the biggest risks and biggest opportunities now that you're presumably quite far along in that integration planning. Thank you. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yes. So good question. I would say that something I'm very, very clear about is that what we stand for as companies around the notion that innovation drives business success, that we drive diversity. Diversity gives us tremendous resilience in the markets that we choose, lots of customers, lots of products, lots of different applications. And also we're companies that focus really on getting great free cash flows from our business through operational efficiency, good price management. So those things we share together. Those are kind of the core business values that underpin both companies. So I would say, clearly there are differences in the way we achieve our goals in terms of the behaviors in the companies, the routines to get the results that we get. And our approach to trying to create something better than the sum of the parts really is to leverage the best of both cultures. And that means basically pooling our business and operating processes together, and we're working hard to figure out what is the best of both on the side of manufacturing supply chain. Obviously, day one it's critical that we have a single voice to the customer, so we're working very, very hard on that. Also, from an ongoing technology and customer management, manufacturing standpoint, pooling our collective knowledge and wisdom and where we're combining the leadership structures, we're going to start combining the organizations to enable us to achieve those goals. And we're also looking for ways to get the blood of both companies flowing in each other's veins through cross-pollination, through physical co-location as best we can. And I think what will be very, very clear is that our measurement and reward system will emphasize what we both care about, which is long-term, profitable growth. So that's essentially how we're approaching things. And I would say I'm very impressed with how both companies are leaning into each other and how we're working to truly try to get the best of both. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, if there's anything we're concerned about, which was one part of your question, I would say we were so enthusiastic about this on both sides and now we've got to wait for all this bureaucracy to kind of take care of itself. So we're a bit anxious to get going and it's just painful to wait as long as we've had to wait to get it done. But I think as soon as it closes, we will be off to the races in terms of making the sum of the parts – or making the combination more than the sum of the parts. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Will, thanks. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks. This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. I had a question about your recently acquired LIDAR business. I was hoping you could talk about how its current position stacks up against the competition and how big of a revenue opportunity you think this could be over the next few years. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so, I mean, at an application level, to be able to realize these future semi-autonomous and autonomous driving systems, you need lots of different types of eyes out there – they're looking for the signal, so to speak. So today, radar and camera, the image processing from cameras, they're the important modalities, but LIDAR is becoming a very important modality. And today, that's realized with mechanical systems essentially. Our approach is to – so we acquired Vescent Photonics, which enables us to bring a more silicon-based technology to bear, which is fundamentally – it's inherently more mechanically robust and enables us to apply a level of signal processing to the core sensing and actuation technology to get the kind of resolution and the kind of reliability and performance that we need to get. So I think it'll be a very important part of the realization of these autonomous driving systems. In fact, I believe that semiconductor process technologies will enable this type of technology to become more broadly deployed. So that's I think the way to look at it. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC Thanks, guys, for taking my questions, and congratulations. Vince, you've talked about the underlying health of global GDP trends. I guess I'm just curious where you see yourself gaining share in some of the sub applications in B2B versus maybe that underlying market support? Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so if you take core Industrial, I mentioned the fact that we were very pleased with our performance in Asia. I think that's been the result of many, many, many years of customer engagement, good deployment of R&D, and that's working well for us. So I think a certain amount – a rising tide will lift all boats, so a certain amount of what we're seeing is driven by what's happening in the macroeconomy, but another part of it is driven by what we are doing to position ourselves to take advantage of these markets as they strengthen. So I'm particularly pleased with industrial, particularly in the automation sector. Dave has talked about A&D and how important Hittite has been to that part of our story. Instrumentation, ATE had a good quarter last one as well. So we're well positioned with high margin, high value, high performance products in that area. Automotive we've talked a lot about, and the foundation of our B2B business is industrial and healthcare. And both of those areas are performing well, driven by our innovation efforts, our customer engagement efforts and the cooperation of the markets David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. And I think there is a belief by us that the industrial markets are going through a change much like the automotive market is already experiencing, this electrification of cars. There is more and more kind of sensor, signal processing, these kind of IoT-like applications going into the industrial space. So the unit volume of the end product, whatever that might be, a robotics system or whatever, may be still the same number of units, but the amount of analog content and semiconductor content, broadly, within those systems is just increasing as they try to sense these things in richer ways, get better data out of them. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. To that point, our customers are becoming more and more and more software-oriented, which opens up a tremendous opportunity for us as a leader in the application of analog technology. So the dependence on ADI is increasing where we are essentially, if you like, filling the vacuum for our customers and providing a lot of the analog engineering solutions to these customers. And as they become more software-oriented in areas like – I mentioned during the prepared remarks here that we have solved a very, very important problem for our customers, where we can take many, many different types of inputs and outputs across various standards where we've been able to do a level of integration in these universal input/output systems, which enable our customers to leverage their software across a bigger swath of analog input/output technology. So that's some of the stuff that's going as we move towards smarter, more software-oriented machines and process automation and factory automation, for example. Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC All right. Thank you, and congrats. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc. Yes. Thank you. So I had a question about the B2B outlook for the April quarter. So I thought industrial is typically up 10-plus percent in April, and I think you guys have said that auto's not too dissimilar. So the fact that you're guiding B2B up mid to high single digits with all the momentum that you're seeing today would sort of suggest that you've got some room to do better. So am I mischaracterizing seasonality? Could you just talk about that a little bit? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so it's more a function of when you're coming off such strong numbers in the first quarter, you're probably not going to have quite the sequential improvement in the second quarter. I think it still drives year-over-year growth that's pretty meaningful, so I don't think there's anything really to read into that other than just the growth off of a very strong first quarter drives it to be a little bit lighter, I think, seasonally. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. And remember, we're at record levels in our industrial business. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Right. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. Next question. Operator And your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Yeah, good morning. Thank you for fitting me in. I guess two quick questions. The first one, can you share on the OpEx side, you did a great job of managing OpEx in a flat revenue environment in fiscal 2016, curious now that revenues appear to be tracking low double digits at least, how we should think about OpEx. And then secondly, now that business is tracking better, free cash flow's coming in stronger, and before you talked about net leverage of 3.8 times at deal close, I would imagine that number would look better. Would love to get an update from you on that. Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. So on the OpEx front, we're obviously going to lag the revenue growth. Probably we'll outgrow it (59:49) at half the rate, maybe we do a little bit better. Of course all this is prior to the Linear Tech integration, and then we'll probably operate in a similar modality after that. As it relates to the net leverage, we'll probably be a little bit better coming in. Partially we also have accumulated a lot of cash in the last couple of quarters and we expect to have a pretty good quarter next quarter for cash flow. So I would suspect that we will come in a little bit under what we originally anticipated. I think maybe more importantly is we think the free cash flow is going to be quite strong in this combined business going forward. And so I think we will end up seeing a little bit more rapid paydown of the debt than we originally anticipated. And so in that respect, we should see some benefit on the interest expense line over time, and that certainly will benefit earnings as well. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Next question. Thanks. Operator Your next question is from Chris Caso with CLSA. Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Just the follow-up on a question on industry conditions and obviously, demand appears pretty favorable now that inventory's low. Do you see any evidence, either within your own business or the industry, of tightening supply conditions? Anything that you think would incentivize the customers and distributors to start bringing the inventory levels a bit higher here? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah. No, I think when you look across the supply chain as far as we can tell, when we look at our inventory levels in distribution, they're really at the low end of where we would expect them to be. When you look at the lead times, and we have a goal here of delivering product within four to six weeks, and we're still delivering basically the entirety of our orders within the stated lead times. So I think you always have little pockets here and there but I'd say, overall, things look pretty good. So next question. Operator Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I also had a follow-up on inventories. You guys mentioned the relatively lean level of seven weeks that the distribution channels were running at. But I was wondering for your direct customers' sales, which is I think about half of your business, can you talk about how the visibility on those inventories look? And also related to it, going back to the distribution channel, I think traditionally, people look at disty channel inventory as a good sort of real-time or lead indicator of how the overall cycle is doing further downstream. But just with the better kind of just-in-time manufacturing methods and ERP systems, do you guys still think that a lower kind of in-line inventory level in the disty channel is still a good sort of a lead indicator? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. The answer to the second is yes. It's a decent indicator, although at the end of the day, it's the customer's inventory level of the distributors that really matters. We don't have tons of visibility into that. We look at the same data you do, which is what they report in terms of their overall inventory levels, which includes our products but also includes a whole bunch of other suppliers into those customers. And they look in the range of pretty healthy levels. So I think that at least as we see it today, that doesn't seem to be anything that would lead you to believe there's an inventory issue out there. I think really how we do and how the industry does is more based on how the macro does and how world GDP does over the course of the next few years. I'd say that's a bigger determinant of how things go. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah. All right. So next question, please. Operator Your next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Richard Sewell - Stephens, Inc. Guys, this is Richard in for Harsh. Just wanted to touch on the small cell commentary you had. I know that this has been kind of a well-advertised, but it continues to kind of get pushed out. What's giving you confidence that this is picking up? What are you hearing from customers? And then how does your content look compared to your traditional wireless infrastructure market? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, we're getting orders, so that's how we know that the small cell is starting to deploy. It's more than just commentary. This is actually, we're getting physical orders and forecasts. So I think we feel pretty confident, unless some – there was some end demand perturbation or something like that. The content is good. It's reasonably similar to what we see on the macro side on a per-radio basis. The difference is that a macro base station could have 16... Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. A lot more (01:04:33) channels. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. 24 channels, and there's only one channel usually for one small cell. So the idea there is that there'll just be a whole lot more of them deployed in a given region or given area, and that's where we – we make it up in volume. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah. I'd say the ramp up of small cell is really beginning to happen now. But I think it'll hit a different pace over the next year or two years. So it'll be a bigger factor in two or three years' time, but our business is still pretty much dominated by macro cell right now. But as Dave said, the channel ASP, the per-channel ASP is about the same, whether it's a small cell or a macro small. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, and I'd just add, as Vince mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did have a record quarter this quarter in our software defined integrated transceiver platforms. And actually, a lot of that was driven by these small cell deployments there are taking place, I'd say particularly in China right now. Okay. Looks like we've got one more caller and then we'll close it down. Operator Our final question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yeah, thanks. I just had one last follow-up and this is on automotive. So instead of looking at sort of the relative growth rates the last year, is there a way for you to talk about dollar content, especially with the Linear acquisition? So what I'm trying to get is, perhaps, maybe now, the content is sort of in the tens of dollars, but then with all these new technologies, you'll eventually be in the hundreds of dollars. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, the LT, again, look, we have a huge range of ASPs per car given the type of technology we deploy and how much of it gets deployed per car. LT, so we have – ADI's business is spread across basically gas-driven cars, combustion engines as well as EV and hybrid. LT's is largely electric and hybrid. So it gives us greater diversity, but it depends very much on the type of car, the brand of car. So it's very, very hard to put a number on it, Tore, but it certainly – we get more diversification, more ASP, on average, virtually in every car that we supply technology to. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. I would say we did like a quick back of the napkin on it. And I think on a low end, we would get somewhere in the $55 range per car; and on the high end, we could do as well as $500. But if we add Linear to the mix, they should add about $100 worth of content, at least from a SAM perspective. Now obviously, we don't win all that business at every car, but – so it's quite strong. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Great. All right, Tore. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. That's very helpful. Thank you. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. For sure. Okay. Great call, great quarter. Hopefully, we'll talk to you guys on the road. That was definitely our last question. Thanks for joining the call this morning, and we'll talk to you again soon. Vincent T.

Thanks for letting ask a question. Congratulations on the strong results. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Guys, relative to your initial guidance, the big upside in the Jan quarter came out of consumer. Just kind of curious what changed throughout the quarter? Was this really just kind of a better mix with your large consumer customer where that would give you more content on a larger screen? And as you think about kind of the opportunity of that customer, how do we think about content going into the back half of this calendar year? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. So, yeah, I would say that in general, with the consumer customer, sometimes it's hard to totally predict kind of the weekly shipment level through the entire quarter, and so we make an estimate based on what we think will turn through the quarter plus what we come into the quarter with backlog. And there's varying scenarios, I would say, related to how that would go, and this was obviously the most optimistic scenario. So it just turned out better. I would point out though that we didn't expect nearly the strength we saw in the B2B markets either, and so they contributed to the upside as well. So we're really happy that every end market did a bit better than expectation. So that was awesome. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. So just to add to what Dave has said there, John, we, as you know, have been working hard to diversify our position and decrease dependence on any single socket. And we have more content in these applications today than we had this time last year, so that certainly helps as well. So we've got more ASP per system, and we continue on the track of diversifying to get more and more sockets in that area. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right, John. Thanks for the question. Next caller, please. Operator Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Tore? Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Congratulations on the strong results. It looks like you announced a new distribution agreement overnight. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that? And maybe this is an opportunity to just talk about the strategy in disty going forward. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so we've had a three decade relationship with the distribution – maybe 25 years with the distribution channel in general. And what we're striving to do, Tore, fundamentally, is we're trying to deepen the level of support and give a better breadth of service for our customers, we have many tens of thousands of customers. So the channel plays an important role, I think, in the broad breadth of logistics, services across the entire suite of customers and, particularly, with the smaller customers, providing a lot of design service. So basically, we've decided to simplify the structure to enable us to bring the level of support that we desire. And we expect basically to be able to leverage the more focused channel team that we've got and essentially draw on a more comprehensive suite of, in a more focused way, end to end support services that could range from design, design help, also prototyping and of course logistics support over the long term. So we're also – we've been investing for all our customers, big and small, over the last several years, by bringing on more direct resource and really understanding the role of the channel. So we're in a good place right now. And of course, when we combine with LTC, we will also have the opportunity to bring more field applications and sales resource to a broader breadth of customers. So overall it's about – it's part of our fundamental strategy which is about innovation, diversity and operation efficiency, and the moves we're making here play to all three of those facets of our business model. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Tore. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Very helpful. Thank you. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Great. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Tore. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Next caller? Operator Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montreal. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi. Thank you very much. Thanks for the update on Linear, Vince. And, Dave, last quarter you had given us an update on the accretion and the tax rate. Now that you've spent quite a fair bit of time in rainy California, I was just wondering how should we think about the top line? And where I was going with this was, at CES, we had some early view on how a go-to-market would look like on a board with Linear and with ADI in a auto (20:26) example. So question is really when should we be expecting it to show up and in what end market should it show up first? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, I would say we get more and more enthusiastic about the opportunities for combining technologies of Linear and ADI every time we meet together as a team. We have kind of loosely built in some expectation that we will get several hundred million dollars worth of revenue synergies with the combined business. Some of that will take some time. I think a lot of it's going to be in areas where the design cycles and the time to revenue is quite long. So it might be out in the 2024, 2025 timeframe where you really start to see us hit our stride. But within the first few years, we'll start to hit and see some revenue synergies and I would point out, that's kind of similar to the path we're on right now with Hittite. We're starting to see it trickle in a little bit in the early stages. We certainly have seen it build up in the opportunity pipeline for the subsequent years here. So we just get, I think, every time we meet, more optimistic about what we can do as a company in terms of delivering technology. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Most of the business of LT and ADI combined is targeted at the core markets of B2B, so we see opportunity. I think at CES you saw how ADAS, for example, combines the power technology of LTC with the mixed-signal technology and RF technology of ADI. But we have examples of that in the industrial automation, the instrumentation, the aerospace and defense. So basically, everywhere we play, including communications infrastructure where ADI is much stronger on the wireless side, LT is stronger on the wired side. There's good symbiosis between the companies, particularly in the B2B space. And I think the first couple of years of the combination of ADI and LTC are really about how well together we take the pipeline of opportunity that's at unprecedented levels in terms of size at this point in time and convert that pipeline and service the heck out of our customers. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. I'd also point out that just on the expense side, as we've had time to solidify the plans there, I think we feel very, very confident about our $150 million expense synergy. I talked about this kind of restructuring charge we took this quarter related to this voluntary retirement. Part of that is to kind of make some room as we integrate the Linear Tech people within the company. So in the 10-Q, it talks about a $28 million savings for just the salary and fringe related to those employees. But we find that there's some extraneous savings like travel and so forth that also are reduced. So I think we have made a pretty meaningful down payment on the $150 million already in advance of even integrating and then, of course, the public company expenses go away pretty quickly too, and that's $20 million, $25 million of expense. So we are very confident now having worked on this and really penciled it out that the $150 million is very achievable. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you, guys. Good luck. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Ambrish. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yes. Thanks. Dave, you piqued my interest on the Hittite revenue synergy side. Can you give a little bit more detail or anecdotes in terms of some of the things you're seeing from a design or revenue ramp perspective on Hittite? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, Vince will probably do a better job of this. But I would tell you that in areas like aerospace and defense where they were particularly strong, we have pulled a lot of ADI content onto those systems and subsystems. That's been a big win for us. I think we did not appreciate how much opportunity we had in the aerospace and defense area until we really acquired Hittite and had that opportunity. There's a lot of radar capability that's required for the automotive space and we're taking a lot of the capability we got from Hittite to be able to drive into that. The next generation which we've talked about in the past is 77 GHz for ADAS, and I think a lot of the capability that we've pulled in from Hittite has helped in that regard. Also, I think that Hittite really just didn't have an opportunity to really address the larger OEMs given their size. Around the edges, they might have won a little bit of business but they really weren't breaking into those OEMs in any meaningful way. That's all changed since they became part of ADI, and these are $10 million, $20 million, $30 million opportunities if you do them right. So I think we estimate that we probably have filled in the pipeline to the tune of $100 million of opportunities because of having the two entities combined that we would not have won otherwise. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so we were running, at the time of acquisition of Hittite, which was just about two and a half years ago now, the revenue stream was roughly $70 million a quarter. So we're running on a percentage basis at a substantially higher level than that right now. And I think to add to what Dave has said, the conversation with our customers has changed over that period of time. I think Hittite and ADI have gone from being very potent component-level suppliers to really now being able to architect our customer systems in these new, for example, digitally-oriented beam steering systems for radar, for mobile communications infrastructure. We're very much now working at the application level in rather than the component level out. So I think it's been really a win-win. And as our customers in the analog space in general are dealing with thinner and thinner levels of resource and capability in terms of engineering their analog solutions, we're very, very well positioned. Hittite helps enormously on the RF and microwave side of things, and LT will help us on the analog systems side with the power side of things primarily. So that's I think how to look at it. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Got it. Thanks. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Craig. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hey. Thanks, guys. Considering the upside in the January quarter and then the guidance for the April quarter, what should we be thinking about conceptually for seasonal revenue growth in the July quarter? And then maybe give us your expectations, if only relative, for the four basic food groups of end markets for revenue growth this year. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, seasonally, usually sequentially, the third quarter is up. You tend to see a stronger consumer environment and the rest of the markets either are up or flattish. And then the fourth quarter, generally, is sequentially up again pretty meaningfully because you really start to see the consumer hit. I'd almost say in this case, we love all our children equally. I mean, I think every end market has the opportunity to grow meaningfully from the prior year. We'll have to see how the rest of the year kind of shakes out, but we start off in a great situation. Our expectations for the second quarter as we look at our backlog, look really good. So this continues into the third and fourth quarter, I think every end market is going to do pretty well for us. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Chris. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congrats on the quarter. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Hi. Thank you. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Question on the consumer side. It's clearly been better than your expectations. Could you just talk about how do you think about the segment over the next 12 months in terms of portables versus the rest of the consumer opportunity you have? And I think this gen (29:03) with your largest customer, you had talked about picking up 30% more content. Do you think that's possible again as they go through, I guess, a super-cycle product for the next year or do you see opportunity with your largest customer more in sync with the unit trajectory they have? Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, our consumer business is really a tale of two stories. We have prosumer, which is a more – it's a business more akin to a B2B type dynamic. So with many customers, many, many very high performance building blocks from DSP to mixed-signal in areas like audio and video signal processing. So we saw some downturn of that business over the last couple of years, but we've kind of hit the bottom. We believe we're at an inflection point there. So that's at least giving us stability. And that's kind of the bedrock of our consumer business in many ways. And so we're at an inflection there. On the portable side of things, we're clearly in a much better position than we were a year ago. We're working hard, as I said earlier, to diversify to get more sockets and things like the image processing control system, sensing in general. And also, we're engaging with many more customers than we did, I should say, on a pretty constrained, highly-leveraged R&D budget. So look, is it possible that we get another 30% increase? Of course it is, and that's what we're working hard to do, to make sure we grab all available high-quality sockets that our technology is well matched to. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking the question, guys, and congratulations on the strong results. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC You're welcome. I wanted to follow up on a couple of the segment dynamics, and first, just looking at industrial and communications. Industrial looks like it's at record revenues, at least in my model, and it seems like there should still be some incremental strength that would come from areas like energy extraction, which I suspect may not be as strong as it's been in the past. And on communications, the business has been barely stable for the last four quarters. Is the strength that you're seeing now leading to a more material increase versus trailing fourth quarter levels or are we really just seeing a seasonal bump and nothing more than that? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. Let me take a shot at it. I'm sure Vince will provide better color than I can give. But I would say you're right in that the industrial business, I think, did hit a record this quarter, which is interesting and the fact that it happened in a first quarter, which tends not to be the strongest industrial quarter for us. So we'll likely hit an even bigger record next quarter in the second quarter, since we expect it to be sequentially up. I think it had kind of a relatively pedestrian last year and maybe not as strong as we would've liked to see it. There was a few things on the macro side that impacted it. I think those have abated, and when you look at every subcategory within the industrial space, all of them are showing good strength. So I think that while it's early and we're always cautious about this, it does look like it's moving into a period of time where we start to see some meaningful growth. And quite honestly we should. We've made a lot of investments in the market, and there are a lot of opportunities for analog content. And so I think we're starting to see the benefits of a lot of development over a lot of years. On the communications side, that business had been up. It came back down quite a bit in the prior periods. It had somewhat stabilized in the back half of last year, and we're in kind of what I think is a relatively stable period. Having said that, I do think there's a lot of opportunity in the comm infrastructure space for us. We have this new transceiver – integrated transceiver that I think is doing quite well. I think we will see our performance on the wireless side be relatively better on the macro side than some of the competition. On top of that, we think that this small cell deployment that has been long advertised and late to the party seems to have really started to gain some momentum here. And so we do expect to see some real traction in 2017 from that. And then lastly, an area that tends not to get as much focus is our wireline business. And with this kind of 100G deployments – 100 gig deployments that are going on right now, we're benefiting from that. And so our wireline business actually did particularly well this quarter. And so I think there's some expectation that for the next – rest of the year it will do quite well. So I don' know exactly how the year will totally shake out yet, we always lack a bit of visibility out beyond the quarter. But I think the fact that it was pretty solid in the first quarter and we're expecting a reasonably good second quarter leads us to believe it'll be a pretty good year for the comms business. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, something we don't talk an awful lot about in our wired business as well is cable infrastructure. And a lot of our new mixed-signal and data converter technologies are enabling the carriers there to realize 4K/8K video. And without our technology, it is impossible, and to be able to do it within constrained physical space as well as power budgets. So that's an area that's doing very, very well for ADI in the signal path along with, as Dave said, in the optical control chain. So I think our wired business is poised – as long as the markets behave well, our wireline business is poised for, I think, very decent growth in the years ahead. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Craig. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks very much. You mentioned you've got six of the seven clearances you need for the Linear deal. Can you remind us which the six are and what the seventh is you're waiting on, and update of when you expect the deal to close? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. I'll butcher the six, so let me just tell you the one that we don't have. We certainly have the U.S. We have all the Europe ones. We have all of Asia except for one, which is China. So we're waiting for China to approve it. I think it's well documented that that's a long process, which is why we expected this thing to close around the end of April is because we knew that that would be a long process. It's going very well. They do ask for a lot of information, and we have to go back and pull the stuff together, present it in a way that is in the format in which they want to see it. And so we think it's going fine, and we would expect that we are on schedule to close this by the end of April at this point. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Great. Thanks. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Sure. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, David. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on the great results. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch My question is, Vince, on the automotive segment. It's very good to see the sales acceleration over the last couple of quarters despite, I know in the past, you've had some headwind in some products. But when I look at some of your analog peers, say Texas Instruments, they grew their auto business by 20% last year. So my question is when do you think those legacy headwinds will start to abate and you can close the growth gap with some of your peer group? Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, we're – better and better positions with our customers and across the various applications. But just for the record, our infotainment business grew in double digits over the past year, as did much of our powertrain and battery control technologies as well. So some of our segments have performed well in the double digit area. I think we've talked before very openly about the fact that we've withdrawn from parts of the MEMS-based safety market, but we still have an important role to play particularly with very, very high-end inertial and gyro-sensing technologies for active safety control. And our ADAS technology continues – the RF and microwave technology there continues to do very, very well, and we're very excited by the 77-gig technology that we're bringing to market as well that we showcased at CES. And that's a whole new level of performance that we're bringing to market there with 77-gig. So I think we're better and better positioned. We're doing a lot more business in Asia than we used to do. And so that kind of evens out the distribution or the diversity of our business across the globe. So those are the facts and we continue to invest heavily in the space because we think it is a growth driver for many, many years to come for ADI. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. And I would tell you that Linear Tech's technology in the battery management system is quite good, and they have seen growth probably in excess of 20% probably in certain years. So I think that we bring that into the fold, that certainly will help just organically drive the growth, but also we should get some pretty good synergies. Where they have good customer traction is in places where we don't, and vice versa. So I think we'll be able to pull each other into customers and engagements that we don't have today. So it should be, I think, a really good growth driver for us going forward. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Vivek. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask a question about gross margins. In the quarter in the guide and then also a little bit longer term, I was surprised in the January quarter that it was as strong as it was given that the consumer side was so strong. So I would have thought mix, all else being equal, would have been a little bit of headwind. And then the inverse, I thought, would've been true in the April quarter where the combination of mix being a tailwind and you just said utilization was going to rise, I thought that might actually lead to a little more upside. So that's kind of the near-term part of the question, if you could give details on that. And then the longer-term one, if we just put Linear and ADI's gross margins together, talk about the deltas above and below that, synergy values, anything else you can capture that makes it more than just one plus one. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. So let's start with this quarter. Well, I would say that if you remember through all of last year, 2016, we kept utilization relatively in check and really worked the inventories down because we really wanted to get the days down below 110 days, and we did achieve that by the end of the year. So like normally coming into the first quarter, we're not as well positioned in terms of inventory levels. And so we end up having to bring utilization down pretty meaningfully in the first quarter, and that didn't happen. So that ended up kind of helping the gross margins. On top of that, the industrial business just did really well through the whole quarter, and so there was really hardly any reason to kind of crank down the fabs in any meaningful way. The mix part, it actually did impact us a little but I would tell you that, that particular piece of business actually has pretty good gross margins, comparatively speaking, relative to other consumer companies out there. And so it's not quite the headwind when we get it and it's not quite the tailwind when it goes away that you might expect. It might impact it 20 basis points or something. For the second quarter, as you point out, we should have a little bit better mix and we are bringing up the utilization, although kind of modestly, we'll probably be in kind of the mid-70s. There's obviously – if the mix goes where the consumer kind of comes down as meaningfully as I said, 40% to 50%, and we do get to the kind of mid-70s kind of gross margins, it's possible that we would be at the really high end of that range. And we'd be up to the 67% range. So that's obviously a scenario. I think we're just hedging ourselves a little bit just in case we can't quite crank the utilization up to those levels, because it does require us to – well, we have the equipped capacity. We still have to crank through the wafers and sometimes that takes a little while to get cranking. Okay. Oh, on the longer-term side. Yeah, Ross, sorry about that. So then I think on a blended basis, we're kind of in the high 60s gross margins just kind of out of the gate. And then about $50 million of the near-term synergies that we're expecting will be in the gross margin line. So we should expect to get into the 70% range pretty easily, I think, with the near-term synergies identified. Honestly, I think longer-term we have the potential to get into low the 70s for gross margins. We will get some – we inherit some processes from Linear Technology that I think are quite strong. I think that will help out in the entire business. I think we will, over time, get more and more efficient in terms of our manufacturing spending. And so I think that will be beneficial to the gross margin line as well. And of course, I think as Vince had talked a lot about, we are really focused in this B2B space and just quite honestly, because of the design cycles and the technology required to deliver what those customers want, it just carries better gross margins. And so I think we will benefit from that as well. So we're optimistic we can get the gross margins into the low 70s. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Ross. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Good morning, and congratulations on the solid execution. On the aerospace and defense, obviously, that drives very good diversification within your business. Fundamentals here appear to be fairly solid. I think there're some pretty large radar, some sat com programs that are firing both in defense and in the commercial sectors. I know you guys talked a little bit about the synergies from Hittite, but just wondering in general, how is the A&D sub-segment tracking, growth-wise, on a year-over-year basis relative to the sort of 10% to 15% growth trend in the industrial segment now? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so I'll just take the last question first. So it's been growing, obviously, at a very healthy clip over the last year or two in kind of the high single digits. I'd say in this quarter, it was probably in kind of the mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. And then the rest the question was what, exactly? Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC How do you guys see this business going for the full year? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Oh. Oh, for the full year this year? Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Probably in that range. I think this is kind of a multiple of GDP kind of growth. It'll be very correlated to how GDP grows. So probably mid to high single digits. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great. Thanks a lot. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Sure. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and I'll echo the congrats on the results. I just wanted to follow up on a question. The B2B business is growing high single digits. If you take out comm, it's more like double digits. You've seen a lot of your analog peers see similar, and it's really a function of the kind of really no seasonality and then kind of growing off that base. Just give us your perspective on the broader markets here as you talk to customers. Why is this market tracking at these double digits? And how do you see that affecting seasonality as you go through the year? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, I'll talk macro and then I'm sure Vince talks to all of these customers, so he can probably give you some more specific color. But I think last year, it didn't grow that much, and so part of it is just rebounding off of a much slower environment in 2016. So I don't think it's altogether surprising that we would see it start to come back. I would tell you though that I think we have – earlier in the period in which people have been focusing on this, back in the 2009, maybe even 2008, before I even got here timeframe, we really did focus our R&D efforts largely in this space. And I think we made it fairly public that we moved a lot of our consumer R&D into the B2B space to really focus on that market and particularly the industrial markets. And so eventually all that development does translate into revenue, as promised. And so I think some of what you're seeing in the results this quarter is that, it's the opportunities starting to translate into revenue more than anything. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, also, while America and Europe are very, very important, they're the bedrock, if you like, of our B2B business, we've been particularly pleased on the industrial side with the growth in our business in Asia as well over the last two or three quarters. So it's broad based and strong in Europe and America, but even stronger on a growth basis in Asia at this point in time. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. The one thing that helps us get some confidence around this – I don't want to oversell it just yet because one quarter doesn't make a pattern – but as you look out in terms of the inventory, particularly using disties as a proxy, it's actually fairly lean at seven weeks. In fact we normally run seven and a half to eight weeks. And for the last, I don't know, maybe four or five quarters, we've been down at this seven-week level and we haven't seen a build. So that's good because that's getting consumed in various regions, particularly in Asia. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Also, if you look at the PMIs of the big CapEx spending economies, they've been strong and strengthening over the last several quarters. So that certainly helps the B2B business. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Great. Thanks, Blayne. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Next question. Operator And your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats, especially on the strength in industrial in the quarter. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. I had a question about the Linear Tech pending acquisition, and it relates to the biggest concern I hear from investors, which is that there's a view that there are significant cultural differences between the two companies. I'm wondering what you've learned as you've built the plan to integrate the two businesses about the differences and similarities culture-wise and what you see as the biggest risks and biggest opportunities now that you're presumably quite far along in that integration planning. Thank you. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yes. So good question. I would say that something I'm very, very clear about is that what we stand for as companies around the notion that innovation drives business success, that we drive diversity. Diversity gives us tremendous resilience in the markets that we choose, lots of customers, lots of products, lots of different applications. And also we're companies that focus really on getting great free cash flows from our business through operational efficiency, good price management. So those things we share together. Those are kind of the core business values that underpin both companies. So I would say, clearly there are differences in the way we achieve our goals in terms of the behaviors in the companies, the routines to get the results that we get. And our approach to trying to create something better than the sum of the parts really is to leverage the best of both cultures. And that means basically pooling our business and operating processes together, and we're working hard to figure out what is the best of both on the side of manufacturing supply chain. Obviously, day one it's critical that we have a single voice to the customer, so we're working very, very hard on that. Also, from an ongoing technology and customer management, manufacturing standpoint, pooling our collective knowledge and wisdom and where we're combining the leadership structures, we're going to start combining the organizations to enable us to achieve those goals. And we're also looking for ways to get the blood of both companies flowing in each other's veins through cross-pollination, through physical co-location as best we can. And I think what will be very, very clear is that our measurement and reward system will emphasize what we both care about, which is long-term, profitable growth. So that's essentially how we're approaching things. And I would say I'm very impressed with how both companies are leaning into each other and how we're working to truly try to get the best of both. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, if there's anything we're concerned about, which was one part of your question, I would say we were so enthusiastic about this on both sides and now we've got to wait for all this bureaucracy to kind of take care of itself. So we're a bit anxious to get going and it's just painful to wait as long as we've had to wait to get it done. But I think as soon as it closes, we will be off to the races in terms of making the sum of the parts – or making the combination more than the sum of the parts. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Will, thanks. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks. This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. I had a question about your recently acquired LIDAR business. I was hoping you could talk about how its current position stacks up against the competition and how big of a revenue opportunity you think this could be over the next few years. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so, I mean, at an application level, to be able to realize these future semi-autonomous and autonomous driving systems, you need lots of different types of eyes out there – they're looking for the signal, so to speak. So today, radar and camera, the image processing from cameras, they're the important modalities, but LIDAR is becoming a very important modality. And today, that's realized with mechanical systems essentially. Our approach is to – so we acquired Vescent Photonics, which enables us to bring a more silicon-based technology to bear, which is fundamentally – it's inherently more mechanically robust and enables us to apply a level of signal processing to the core sensing and actuation technology to get the kind of resolution and the kind of reliability and performance that we need to get. So I think it'll be a very important part of the realization of these autonomous driving systems. In fact, I believe that semiconductor process technologies will enable this type of technology to become more broadly deployed. So that's I think the way to look at it. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC Thanks, guys, for taking my questions, and congratulations. Vince, you've talked about the underlying health of global GDP trends. I guess I'm just curious where you see yourself gaining share in some of the sub applications in B2B versus maybe that underlying market support? Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so if you take core Industrial, I mentioned the fact that we were very pleased with our performance in Asia. I think that's been the result of many, many, many years of customer engagement, good deployment of R&D, and that's working well for us. So I think a certain amount – a rising tide will lift all boats, so a certain amount of what we're seeing is driven by what's happening in the macroeconomy, but another part of it is driven by what we are doing to position ourselves to take advantage of these markets as they strengthen. So I'm particularly pleased with industrial, particularly in the automation sector. Dave has talked about A&D and how important Hittite has been to that part of our story. Instrumentation, ATE had a good quarter last one as well. So we're well positioned with high margin, high value, high performance products in that area. Automotive we've talked a lot about, and the foundation of our B2B business is industrial and healthcare. And both of those areas are performing well, driven by our innovation efforts, our customer engagement efforts and the cooperation of the markets David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. And I think there is a belief by us that the industrial markets are going through a change much like the automotive market is already experiencing, this electrification of cars. There is more and more kind of sensor, signal processing, these kind of IoT-like applications going into the industrial space. So the unit volume of the end product, whatever that might be, a robotics system or whatever, may be still the same number of units, but the amount of analog content and semiconductor content, broadly, within those systems is just increasing as they try to sense these things in richer ways, get better data out of them. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. To that point, our customers are becoming more and more and more software-oriented, which opens up a tremendous opportunity for us as a leader in the application of analog technology. So the dependence on ADI is increasing where we are essentially, if you like, filling the vacuum for our customers and providing a lot of the analog engineering solutions to these customers. And as they become more software-oriented in areas like – I mentioned during the prepared remarks here that we have solved a very, very important problem for our customers, where we can take many, many different types of inputs and outputs across various standards where we've been able to do a level of integration in these universal input/output systems, which enable our customers to leverage their software across a bigger swath of analog input/output technology. So that's some of the stuff that's going as we move towards smarter, more software-oriented machines and process automation and factory automation, for example. Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC All right. Thank you, and congrats. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc. Yes. Thank you. So I had a question about the B2B outlook for the April quarter. So I thought industrial is typically up 10-plus percent in April, and I think you guys have said that auto's not too dissimilar. So the fact that you're guiding B2B up mid to high single digits with all the momentum that you're seeing today would sort of suggest that you've got some room to do better. So am I mischaracterizing seasonality? Could you just talk about that a little bit? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so it's more a function of when you're coming off such strong numbers in the first quarter, you're probably not going to have quite the sequential improvement in the second quarter. I think it still drives year-over-year growth that's pretty meaningful, so I don't think there's anything really to read into that other than just the growth off of a very strong first quarter drives it to be a little bit lighter, I think, seasonally. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. And remember, we're at record levels in our industrial business. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Right. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. Next question. Operator And your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Yeah, good morning. Thank you for fitting me in. I guess two quick questions. The first one, can you share on the OpEx side, you did a great job of managing OpEx in a flat revenue environment in fiscal 2016, curious now that revenues appear to be tracking low double digits at least, how we should think about OpEx. And then secondly, now that business is tracking better, free cash flow's coming in stronger, and before you talked about net leverage of 3.8 times at deal close, I would imagine that number would look better. Would love to get an update from you on that. Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. So on the OpEx front, we're obviously going to lag the revenue growth. Probably we'll outgrow it (59:49) at half the rate, maybe we do a little bit better. Of course all this is prior to the Linear Tech integration, and then we'll probably operate in a similar modality after that. As it relates to the net leverage, we'll probably be a little bit better coming in. Partially we also have accumulated a lot of cash in the last couple of quarters and we expect to have a pretty good quarter next quarter for cash flow. So I would suspect that we will come in a little bit under what we originally anticipated. I think maybe more importantly is we think the free cash flow is going to be quite strong in this combined business going forward. And so I think we will end up seeing a little bit more rapid paydown of the debt than we originally anticipated. And so in that respect, we should see some benefit on the interest expense line over time, and that certainly will benefit earnings as well. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Next question. Thanks. Operator Your next question is from Chris Caso with CLSA. Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Just the follow-up on a question on industry conditions and obviously, demand appears pretty favorable now that inventory's low. Do you see any evidence, either within your own business or the industry, of tightening supply conditions? Anything that you think would incentivize the customers and distributors to start bringing the inventory levels a bit higher here? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah. No, I think when you look across the supply chain as far as we can tell, when we look at our inventory levels in distribution, they're really at the low end of where we would expect them to be. When you look at the lead times, and we have a goal here of delivering product within four to six weeks, and we're still delivering basically the entirety of our orders within the stated lead times. So I think you always have little pockets here and there but I'd say, overall, things look pretty good. So next question. Operator Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I also had a follow-up on inventories. You guys mentioned the relatively lean level of seven weeks that the distribution channels were running at. But I was wondering for your direct customers' sales, which is I think about half of your business, can you talk about how the visibility on those inventories look? And also related to it, going back to the distribution channel, I think traditionally, people look at disty channel inventory as a good sort of real-time or lead indicator of how the overall cycle is doing further downstream. But just with the better kind of just-in-time manufacturing methods and ERP systems, do you guys still think that a lower kind of in-line inventory level in the disty channel is still a good sort of a lead indicator? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. The answer to the second is yes. It's a decent indicator, although at the end of the day, it's the customer's inventory level of the distributors that really matters. We don't have tons of visibility into that. We look at the same data you do, which is what they report in terms of their overall inventory levels, which includes our products but also includes a whole bunch of other suppliers into those customers. And they look in the range of pretty healthy levels. So I think that at least as we see it today, that doesn't seem to be anything that would lead you to believe there's an inventory issue out there. I think really how we do and how the industry does is more based on how the macro does and how world GDP does over the course of the next few years. I'd say that's a bigger determinant of how things go. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah. All right. So next question, please. Operator Your next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Richard Sewell - Stephens, Inc. Guys, this is Richard in for Harsh. Just wanted to touch on the small cell commentary you had. I know that this has been kind of a well-advertised, but it continues to kind of get pushed out. What's giving you confidence that this is picking up? What are you hearing from customers? And then how does your content look compared to your traditional wireless infrastructure market? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, we're getting orders, so that's how we know that the small cell is starting to deploy. It's more than just commentary. This is actually, we're getting physical orders and forecasts. So I think we feel pretty confident, unless some – there was some end demand perturbation or something like that. The content is good. It's reasonably similar to what we see on the macro side on a per-radio basis. The difference is that a macro base station could have 16... Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. A lot more (01:04:33) channels. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. 24 channels, and there's only one channel usually for one small cell. So the idea there is that there'll just be a whole lot more of them deployed in a given region or given area, and that's where we – we make it up in volume. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah. I'd say the ramp up of small cell is really beginning to happen now. But I think it'll hit a different pace over the next year or two years. So it'll be a bigger factor in two or three years' time, but our business is still pretty much dominated by macro cell right now. But as Dave said, the channel ASP, the per-channel ASP is about the same, whether it's a small cell or a macro small. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, and I'd just add, as Vince mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did have a record quarter this quarter in our software defined integrated transceiver platforms. And actually, a lot of that was driven by these small cell deployments there are taking place, I'd say particularly in China right now. Okay. Looks like we've got one more caller and then we'll close it down. Operator Our final question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yeah, thanks. I just had one last follow-up and this is on automotive. So instead of looking at sort of the relative growth rates the last year, is there a way for you to talk about dollar content, especially with the Linear acquisition? So what I'm trying to get is, perhaps, maybe now, the content is sort of in the tens of dollars, but then with all these new technologies, you'll eventually be in the hundreds of dollars. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, the LT, again, look, we have a huge range of ASPs per car given the type of technology we deploy and how much of it gets deployed per car. LT, so we have – ADI's business is spread across basically gas-driven cars, combustion engines as well as EV and hybrid. LT's is largely electric and hybrid. So it gives us greater diversity, but it depends very much on the type of car, the brand of car. So it's very, very hard to put a number on it, Tore, but it certainly – we get more diversification, more ASP, on average, virtually in every car that we supply technology to. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. I would say we did like a quick back of the napkin on it. And I think on a low end, we would get somewhere in the $55 range per car; and on the high end, we could do as well as $500. But if we add Linear to the mix, they should add about $100 worth of content, at least from a SAM perspective. Now obviously, we don't win all that business at every car, but – so it's quite strong. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Great. All right, Tore. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. That's very helpful. Thank you. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. For sure. Okay. Great call, great quarter. Hopefully, we'll talk to you guys on the road. That was definitely our last question. Thanks for joining the call this morning, and we'll talk to you again soon. Vincent T.

Muse - Evercore Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley Tore Svanberg - Stifel William Stein - SunTrust Chris Danely - Citigroup Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets Craig Ellis - B. Riley Tristan Gerra - Baird Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research Operator Good morning and welcome to the Analog Devices Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I’d like to now introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain Alright. Good morning and thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining the Analog Devices second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. So let’s get through our disclosures. Note the information we are about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our commentary about ADI’s second quarter financial results, are adjusted for special items. When comparing our second quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also adjusted in the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Available reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today’s earnings release and on our web schedules which we have posted under the quarterly results section at investor.analog.com. As many of you know, we have completed the Linear Tech acquisition about halfway through our fiscal second quarter. And so we have included reconciliations in our Investor page that provide a greater level of detail into our standalone and combined results for the quarter. But at a high level, I will say that Linear contributed $208 million to our non-GAAP second quarter revenue. This number includes $60 million of purchase accounting adjustments that were made for U.S. GAAP purposes and relate to Linear Tech inventory that was in the distribution channel in North America and Japan when we closed the acquisition. At the end of the second quarter, there remains an additional $30 million of Linear inventory in the distribution channel, which we expect will be sold in its entirety in the third quarter. We have included this adjustment in our non-GAAP revenue expectations for the third quarter and no such adjustments are anticipated starting in the fourth quarter. And then the last point I will make and its information you should be mindful of is that the first quarter of our fiscal 2018 will be a 14-week quarter. Okay. So, with all that behind us, about to get the show on the road, I will turn it over to ADI’s CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince’s comments on the second quarter are for standalone ADI unless he specifies otherwise. And our business outlook for the third fiscal quarter relates to the combined company. Okay. Vince, all yours. Vincent Roche Thank you very much, Ali. Good morning, everyone. Well, it’s been a very busy period for ADI and I am pleased to share our results with you. Not only were our second quarter financial results stellar, but we completed the acquisition of Linear Tech in March and our integration work is going very well. So, let’s start with our financial results for the second quarter. ADI’s standalone revenue came in at $1 billion, a 2% sequential increase and a 28% increase over the prior year. These results were above our revised guidance on broad-based strength and we continue to see signs of a good business environment, particularly in the industrial market. Gross margins expended to 67.6%, which was above the high end of our guidance and the combination of higher sales, higher gross margins and tight control over operating expenses helped to expand operating margins to a robust 36% of sales. In addition, free cash flow margins, as a combined company, were also strong at 39% of revenue in the second quarter. As Ali mentioned, Linear Tech was part of ADI for about half the quarter and contributed $208 million in sales on a non-GAAP basis. And we are looking forward to a full quarter’s contribution in our third quarter. Now, let me give you some details of our performance by end market during the quarter and note that my remarks relate only to standalone ADI. The industrial markets at 46% of sales grew 15% sequentially in the seasonally strong second quarter and continued its year-over-year growth trajectory, increasing 20% over the prior year. Sequential revenue growth was broad-based across all industrial sectors and indeed regions. While business conditions are certainly more positive than they were at this point last year, our success is also the result of smart R&D investments across diverse industrial applications within factory automation, instrumentation, aerospace and defense and healthcare. Over several decades, ADI has carved as a leadership position in high performance signal processing, serving our tens of thousands of industrial customers where applications demand the highest levels of performance both in terms of signal chain and in terms of power optimization. In the near-term, our industrial customers are excited to gain access to the highly complementary portfolios of ADI and Linear Tech and are even more excited at the future of value creation opportunities made possible by our combination. The automotive market represented 15% of our sales in the second quarter and grew 8% sequentially and 9% over the prior year. Both sequential and year-over-year growth was broad-based across all automotive application areas and was strongest in safety and ADAS applications, while powertrain revenue increased, but at a slower pace. We supply thousands of products into dozens of automotive sub-applications and are gaining more dollar content as we further automate and electrify. The combination with LT dramatically strengthens our technology offerings in this market and expands additional dollar content opportunities across our very complementary customer base. The communications infrastructure market, at 18% of sales, grew 5% sequentially and 4% over the prior year. Sequential revenue growth in this market was led by wireless infrastructure applications where we are making very good progress with our RF and microwave and high-speed signal processing and integrated transceiver solutions. While we are, of course, only in the very early stages of 5G cellular infrastructure deployment, we believe that our optimized radio signal processing and power management solutions will be a very key driver of growth as channel counts increase and customers moved to phase their antennas to make the most efficient use of available spectrum with the highest reliability and performance. Of course, the wireless infrastructure market is one where Linear largely didn’t play and thus this market represents an opportunity to drive revenue synergies in the medium term. On a year-over-year basis, communications infrastructure growth was led by the wireline sector where ADI’s customers are benefiting from our position clocking, timing and control technologies in the 100-gig and beyond optical networking applications. And finally, consumer market revenues at 21% of sales decreased 24% sequentially as prosumer applications revenue increased and portable applications revenue came in better than planned. Compared to the prior year, both prosumer and portable applications revenue increased. So while our combined financial results were excellent, our near and long-term outlooks are equally bright. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Linear Tech, creating the high-performance analog market leader. As we said from the beginning, we are taking a best of both approach combining the best from ADI and LTC to come up with a new operating system to drive long-term profitable growth for our combined company and I am very pleased with the progress we have already made. We are optimizing processes across our selling, new product development, manufacturing and operations activities. On the sales side, the integration of our two sales forces has brought with it a tremendous degree of excitement and we have already identified many sales synergy opportunities. On the engineering side, our teams have come together at remarkable speed and have begun identifying product roadmap combinations that we expect over the long-term will accelerate our growth. On the manufacturing side, our teams have been focused on ensuring that we meet the upside demand and continue to deliver the highest quality products to our customers. Overall, our $150 million cost synergy target within 18 months of the acquisition is firmly on track. To give you some background, during the integration planning phase, the vast majority of actions needed to realize the synergy target were identified. And while many of the related actions have already been taken, we are only in the early stages of seeing the benefits of those synergies in our P&L. In addition we expect non-GAAP EPS accretion in our first full quarter as a combined company to be 15% and we expect earnings accretion to accelerate into fiscal 2018 as we begin to more fully realize the synergies from the transaction. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Ali for details of our financial performance in the second quarter. Ali Husain Great. Thanks Vince. Good morning everybody. Since the acquisition of Linear Tech occurred about half way through our second quarter, Linear Tech’s contributions to ADI’s results were limited to approximately seven weeks and my prepared remarks will exclude Linear’s results and other special items unless I specify otherwise. Note that a schedule reconciling our standalone and combined performance can be found in our Investor page at investor.analog.com and a reconciliation of our combined GAAP performance to our combined non-GAAP performance can be found in schedules E and F of today’s earnings release. So revenue in the second quarter increased to $1 billion growing 2% sequentially and 28% over the prior year and was above our revised guidance. Sequential revenue growth was led by our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure, which in the aggregate grew 11% sequentially and importantly 14% over the prior year. Gross margins in the second quarter were 67.6%, up 150 basis points from the 66.1% we achieved in the prior quarter, primarily the result of higher utilization rates. Days of inventory increased 3 days to 104 days and dollars of inventory increased $12 million sequentially as we increased production to match strong demand. Deferred revenue for shipments in the distribution increased 6% sequentially and weeks of inventory in distribution were at seven weeks, which was consistent with the prior quarter. Operating expense of $318 million increased 4% sequentially due to the natural lift from higher activity in the second quarter and as compared to the first and higher variable compensation in the second quarter as our bonus program responded a better year-over-year revenue growth and operating profit in the quarter. As a result, operating margins of 36% of sales expanded 500 basis points compared to the prior year on strong revenue growth, higher gross margins and prudent expense management by the team. So now for P&L line items below the operating margin line, I will talk to results on a combined company basis, excluding special items, outlined in today’s release. Other expense in the second quarter was $59 million, the result of a partial quarter with the financing related to the Linear Tech acquisition in place. We expect our net interest expense to be approximately $70 million in the third quarter and approximately $60 million per quarter thereafter. Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 10% and that’s the rate we expect for the remaining two quarters of the year. We are also planning for a non-GAAP tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 15%, so note that will be higher than the 10% rate this year. Our diluted share count increased in the quarter due to the equity consideration related to the acquisition. Since this is a weighted average calculation, the diluted share count in 2Q increased to 346 million shares and we expect diluted share count in the third quarter, which will be our first full quarter as a combined company to be approximately 375 million shares. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2017 was $1.03. The second quarter was also a very strong free cash flow quarter. As a combined company, we generated $475 million in free cash flow in the second quarter. And for the reported trailing 12 months, the combined company has generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, which translates to free cash flow margins of 37%. Now this level of free cash flow generation is noteworthy for several reasons. First, it reflects the strength of our business model and our brand. Second, it means that our EBITDA generation was also very strong. And this means that we are better positioned from a leverage ratio standpoint at the current time than we had – than we have communicated to you earlier. So as a result, our net debt to EBITDA ratio based on reported combined company results is in fact approximately 3x, which is significantly lower than the 3.8x net debt to EBITDA number that we had estimated when we announced the deal. So moving to capital additions, which in the second quarter were $47 million for the combined company and are planned to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million for the year in 2017. During the quarter, we also paid $139 million in dividends and earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on June 20 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 9. And that represents an annual dividend payment to shareholders of $1.80 per share. Okay. So with that, I will turn it back over to Vince for our outlook for the third quarter of 2017, which again is on a combined company basis and excludes special items outlined in today’s release. Vincent Roche Thanks Ali. After a strong second quarter performance, we are planning for a continued sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter and for revenue to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion. By end market, we are planning for continued sequential revenue growth in industrial and for the communications end market to remain stable to the prior quarter. In automotive, we anticipate that seasonal trends would prevail, which would suggest a mid single-digit sequential decline in the third quarter. In the consumer market, we are planning for modest sequential revenue growth in the third quarter. We expect gross margins to be between 69% and 70% as we keep utilization levels stable to their second quarter rates and benefit from higher industrial revenue mix. We estimate that operating expenses will be between $430 million and $440 million. Notably, this translates into an operating margin range of 38% to 40% in the third quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.21. While we continue to see good business conditions, we are always pragmatic and cautious in how we manage our business and in how we convert our precious resources into free cash flow. On this point, with the combination complete, ADI’s free cash flow margin now ranks within the top 5% of the S&P 500. At our Investor Day on June 20, we will outline our plan to drive the long-term profitable growth for ADI, leveraging the customer value creation capabilities of our innovation and business diversity and our focus on best-in-class operational efficiencies to continue to drive our free cash flow to even higher levels. So with that, we are ready now to take your questions. Ali Husain Alright. Thanks Vince. So before we get to the Q&A session, just a couple of quick housekeeping items for me. So note that we will be hosting an Investor Day on June 20. It’s accessible via live webcast. I invite you all to tune in on June 20 to hear more about our long-term strategy and the new financial model for the company. And so let’s get to the Q&A session. We will try our best to get to all of our callers, so please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response we will give you an opportunity for a follow-up. So operator, can we have our first question, please. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava Hi, thank you very much for letting me ask questions. I had a medium-term question Ali and maybe you could answer that and then I had a longer term follow-up for Vince. So for the medium-term, could you please help us frame the consumer business, how – and when I say medium term, I am thinking how should we be thinking about this over the next 6 months to 18 months? And then I had a follow-up for Vince. Ali Husain Okay. Sure. Thanks Ambrish. Look I guess what I would tell you is our strategy in consumer is no different than our strategy in any of our markets. We focus on very tough problems that our customers have. We work to solve those for them. We try and create as much value as possible for our customers. And in turn that tends to generate a lot of free cash flow for ADI. I would say the only difference in consumer, relative to our other markets is that the product life cycles tend to be a little bit shorter. But apart from that, I would say the strategy at ADI is very, very consistent across all of our markets. Now you have seen that strategy play out over the last couple of years. We have grown our consumer business nicely. It’s generated a lot of free cash flow for the company. We have diversified our position in consumer both at our large customer. We have diversified our position across many other customers and into new vectors of growth that we think will drive consumer free cash flow and revenue growth over the long-term. All that being said, you know as well as I do that the consumer market tends to have shorter lifecycles. And so as a result, you can’t have periods of time where you have got some older designs that are rolling off and there is a bit of a pause between that happening and newer designs rolling on. My sense is that we are likely in one of those periods at the current time. I expect as a result, our mix of B2B markets to expand as a percentage of our revenue as we get into the back half of 2017. And I would expect that to continue into 2018 as well. I guess, the only other point I would make is just to provide a little bit more context, Ambrish, is we manage a very complex mix of portfolios and businesses at ADI. Each one of them have different lifecycles. Each one of them have different revenue growth profiles. Each one of them have different profitability profiles. But what I would tell you is as long as ADI is focusing on very tough solved problems to solve for our customers and we can drive a lot of free cash flow. And frankly, if we are meeting our hurdle rates and we can drive really good long-term profitable growth in free cash flow, we will play, because ultimately that’s the measure. Vince mentioned it in the prepared remarks we are now a top 5% S&P 500 free cash flow generator. And our goal is to drive that even higher from here. Operator Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First clarification, in terms of the revenue guide, was that combined or did that exclude old Linear? And then I guess as my main question just to follow-up on Ambrish’s question around consumer. Is that a business looking into calendar ‘17 and ‘18 that can grow given that you have brought on diversification increase to customer or is that something that we should be thinking about declining over the next 1, 2 years? Ali Husain Okay. So I think that was your first question and a follow-up. So, I think on the revenue side, we have provided combined company guidance for both companies and the range is $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion that would imply a midpoint of $1.41 billion. And I guess if you were just to think about how that flows by end markets, C.J., we expect the industrial market again had a very good second quarter. We expect that strength to continue into the third quarter. As a result, we are expecting industrial to grow somewhere in the low to mid single-digits sequentially in the third quarter, which again would be better than seasonal. Automotive, we are expecting a pretty seasonal quarter. So, as a result that would decline kind of in the mid single-digits sequentially. Communications is implied to be relatively stable. And on the consumer side, we are expecting modest sequential growth relative to the second quarter. And Vince, did you want to take the question about consumer implied growth in 2017 and 2018? Vincent Roche Yes. I think as Ali said, we experienced fundamentally shorter lifecycles in the consumer markets. And we have been working very, very hard over the last couple of years to diversify our product base and our customer base, the application base within consumer and we are making good progress of that. I think as we look into the third quarter, as Ali said, we are seeing modest sequential revenue growth, but nonetheless below what we would consider to be seasonal norms. So we are probably in a slower growth environment in the consumer business for the near-term here. Ali Husain And I’d say, C.J., if I could just add two points. One is we do expect as a result, our B2B markets to expand as a percentage of total revenue. And I think as you look into 2018, the accretion from the Linear Tech deal is very strong here in the third quarter, about 15%. And given some of the synergies that we have talked about, we expect that EPS accretion to accelerate into 2018 and I think that would be a very strong result. So, can we get to our next caller? Operator Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur Good morning. Congratulations on the strong results. Given the stronger industrial demand flow and outlook for continued growth, just wondering if you guys are seeing any component tightness or lead time stretching out? I know a few of your peers have highlighted some tightness. I am just – it sounds like you guys still have more room to grow on utilization, but wanted to get your views on the supply side situation? Ali Husain Thanks. Good question, Harlan, one that we obviously think about a lot as well. But I would tell you, we are delivering the vast majority of our products within our stated lead times of 4 to 6 weeks. That frankly hasn’t changed all that much over the last several quarters. I guess, what I would tell you is that ADI we are very focused on providing the highest levels of customer service and support and part of that service and support model is to deliver products when we tell our customers that we are going to deliver them. And so we tend to keep our lead times pretty short, 4 to 6 weeks delivering the vast majority of our products within those stated lead times. And I guess, I would also tell you that we are carrying 3.5 months worth of inventory in our balance sheet, which I think is a fair amount of inventory to help supply our customers with the products. The only one other point I perhaps make in this front is that if you recall back in 2016, we did bring our utilization rates down pretty hard. And the reason we did that is we wanted to manage our DSI or days of inventory down. And we managed the impact on gross margins by making permanent improvements in our cost structure. And I think as you now look out to 2017 and 2018, I think what investors should expect from ADI is a nice benefit on the drop-throughs, because as we are building the inventory, the drop-throughs are certainly better. But I guess, just coming back to your earlier point on the lead times, vast majority delivered within 4 to 6 weeks and we are keeping up high levels of service to our customers. Did you have a follow-up? Harlan Sur No, I’m good. Thank you. Ali Husain Okay. Operator Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach Yes, thank you. Question for Vince, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments around automotive with Linear Tech. And more specifically, can you talk about how expansive your opportunity set is, so if there is any examples of things that you think they will help you expand the content within automotive? Vincent Roche Yes. So automotive for us is a story of continuing content gain here for both LTC and for ADI. So, we see it as a key growth market for the combined companies. So I think we have talked before about ADI having great strength in emerging applications like, for example, 77-gigahertz radar, LIDAR infotainment with our A2B technology, for example, bringing new technologies into the powertrain, such as the rotationals and Linear sensing, magnetic devices. And as the powertrain electrifies being able to get our battery management technologies in there as well. So, I think both LTC and ADI have a lot of complimentary capability, for example, to the ADI signal chains that I have just talked about here, we are adding LTC power management capability. And the outcome of that is we can architect an optimized solution for each of the sub-applications here for the automotive customers. And there is great complementarity between the signal chain and the power chain. So I think that’s looking very, very good. And also, there is a lot of new power management things that we are looking at independent of signal chains that LT will be instrumental in helping us nail down over the coming few years. So, there is a tremendous amount of benefit in coupling power management with the signal chain. And every single application which we play within the transportation automotive sector requires both signal chain and power management. And what I am seeing so far is the tremendous level of collaboration between the applications teams, the design teams and really grabbing the opportunities here with both hands. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Craig. Did you have a follow-up? Craig Hettenbach Yes. I guess just a brief one, just on the integration, good to hear that it’s on track and kind of good start out of the gate. Just any comments in terms of culture, key people and kind of milestones we should be aware of? Vincent Roche Well, we have known that LT is a very, very high-quality company. And I have been obviously hands on involved in the integration of the two companies. I am very, very impressed by the quality of the people throughout LT and I am also very impressed with just how fast both companies are coming together to create something better than the sum of the parts. So right now, we are laser focused on leveraging the combined strengths of both companies to generate this long-term profitable growth possibility that we know is there. And we are taking our time to really figure out – we have been very, very patient at figuring out how to combine the leadership – we have combined the leadership teams, but we have been very patient in trying to figure out what the best of both really means here. So I think to answer your question, very directly here Craig, we are culturally I think in good shape. Our values as I have talked about many times before, the values around technology and business and customer are very, very similar. And in creating this best of both, we are actually leveraging the differences in the way the operating routines of both companies to draw from, to create something greater than some of the parts. So we are focused as I said on delighting our customers, ensuring that we are capturing the upside demand here. And I think overall the – once the values are compatible, as I said I am using the cultural differences to create something greater than the sum of the parts. And the LT leadership is playing a key role. I have got two members of the senior LTC staff and my staff. And the LT leaders are contributing to this new company multiple levels down at this point in time. Craig Hettenbach Great. Thanks. Ali Husain Thank you. We will get to our next caller. Operator And our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Vincent Roche You are back, good. Ambrish Srivastava Hi. Thank you. I had my follow-up keyed up. For some reason I got dropped off. Thanks for accommodating me back. I wanted to get back to the capital allocation and the free cash flow, it seems like the free cash flow generating ability might be higher than at least what our models were suggesting. So could you please remind us just in terms of capital allocation and the timing for the pay down, obviously the leverage ratio was lower than what you had communicated and what it was at the deal close, so any light on that would be very helpful? Thank you. Ali Husain Okay, fair enough. I will leave the key take away for next month when we present to you at the Analyst Day, because I think we want to save a little bit of dry powder for that. But what I would tell you is since we announced the acquisition, there is a couple of things. One is we set out this target of 3.8x net debt to EBITDA. And then a typical ADI fashion, we put out targets and we had executed extremely aggressively against those targets. And part of it is just coming out at a lower leverage ratio is just a function of the mindset at ADIs. We execute extremely aggressively against the targets that we lay out. Part of it is like business conditions have been better and as a result, we have generated more cash flow. And part of it frankly is just having a laser focus on operational efficiencies. And so that’s driven a lot of good cash flow as well. The good news I guess from a leverage perspective as we have talked about is we are certainly well ahead of schedule in terms of the de-leveraging plan. The bogie we are shooting for is 2x net debt to EBITDA and I would say we are probably ahead of schedule in trying to hit that number. Once we get to that number, I think we have been pretty public in terms of saying, look we are going to turn the share buyback program back on. In the meanwhile the dividend remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation strategy. And then the only other last point I would make is and again this kind of supports the notion of that we are ahead of schedule is after the quarter ended, we did pay $200 million down on the $5 billion term loan balance. So I think we are certainly ahead of schedule and in very good shape on that front. Ambrish Srivastava Okay. Thank you very much. Ali Husain Okay, great. Operator Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. So the industrial market is growing very strongly, I believe you mentioned 20% year-over-year, how much of that is the market coming back versus perhaps more electronic content or even some share gains? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. I think it’s true to say that first off we are recovering from a relatively weak environment in the prior year. So the compare is kind of easy from that perspective. From everything that we can tell right now, the growth is broad based across all the industrial sectors and in fact across all the geographies as well. And I think that’s just a function of the better business environment versus last year overall. And if you just paying attention to our own customers as well, they are all guiding for low to high single-digit growth in 2017. As a company, several years ago, we made a strategic pivot in terms of where we placed our R&D, putting more into B2B applications. And industrial has been a great beneficiary of that. So I think just given the cycles in the industrial sector in general, we are beginning to see some of those products really contribute in a meaningful way across factory and process automation, aerospace and defense, the instrumentation ATE business. And so I think the business environment is overall better, but we are also doing better in terms of grabbing share through the effects of our new product investments over the last several years. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. Vince, you also mentioned earlier that you plan to leverage Linear Technology into the wireless infrastructure market, I was just hoping you could elaborate just a little bit more on that because certainly, that’s a market that’s been weaker the last 2 years, but I assume with 5G coming on, your plan is to leverage both entities to participate in that market? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. Well, we are – as ADI organic, we have been doing better and better in terms of building solutions for our customers from antenna right down to bits, leveraging the strength of ADI and Hittite combined. And we know that as customers put greater and greater pressure on for more integration, to be able to solve the noise problems more effectively in these radio systems, that power management is going to be a great help to us. And already, I think in the shorter term, we are being actively engaged in discussions to use existing products with ADI solutions, for example, in the transceiver space, in 5G systems, leveraging LTE’s power technology. And that’s only the beginning because over the coming generations when we can start to architect the radio solutions now with the new advances in power management technology that LT has been making, I think we can have several generations here of success in both the wired and the wireless business in the years ahead. And there is no doubt there is tremendous symbiosis between the signal chain technologies that ADI has been so strong in over the years with the power technologies that LT now brings to the table. So the conversations with our customers are very active and with existing products and we are now plotting the next new architectures based on the combination of the two companies. Tore Svanberg Alright. Thank you. Ali Husain Thank you very much. Next question please. Operator Your next question is from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks for taking my question. I am hoping you can expand on something you touched on earlier, the cultural differences, however may be they are not as great as some people perceive, but I think one of them is that Linear was known for having an intense focus on gross profit margin and perhaps that limited that business’ revenue growth and I think ADI has a more growthy sort of outlook. So I am wondering if you can sort of highlight any initial opportunities to expand the growth rate on the Linear business? Vincent Roche Yes. It’s a good question. It’s true that both companies have had very, very strong focus on gross margin. I think it’s a great kind of proxy for the quality of the innovation that you are developing, the price you can command and ultimately, the gross margins that you can get. So what I will say is that ADI has probably just – given our buying power, their operational focus. We have combined now with LT we have got more buying power. So we can be more flexible in terms of taking some market share with products already available without sacrificing the margins, just giving the signings of the so called bill of materials that we are now sourcing across both companies. So we don’t intend to drop our standards, but we do intend to be aggressive in terms of leveraging all the available products and technologies that we have to grow our business profitably. I think that’s the way to think about it. Ali Husain And did you have any follow-up, Will? William Stein I did. One of the issues from the integration that’s always important in any of these transactions is ERP, and by the disclosure around end markets that sort of lumps the Linear Tech revenue in its own category maybe a sign that perhaps that’s going to take a bit of time to reflect their revenue across your end markets. Any guidance or commentary as to when we should see that disclosed sort of on a combined basis and just in general the update on that aspect of the integration? Ali Husain Yes, fair enough. I can take part of that. Look, from an ERP’s perspective and frankly from an integration perspective, we are generally keeping Linear Tech on a standalone basis for the first year. And then we will converge. With regards specifically to the end market question, we actually have the data. I just didn’t feel like it was that meaningful for a stub quarter and I can certainly talk to it right now in the call. But you should expect from ADI next quarter that we have all of the disclosures by end markets mapped out and that’s absolutely no issue to do. What I would tell you in the quarter, had Linear been part of ADI for a full quarter, they would have seen their industrial business grow and they would have seen their automotive business decrease sequentially given their exposure to the powertrain market, specifically in transportation in China, which has been a weaker market. But the good news there I’d say well is that, that market is actually pretty stable right now and that gives us a fair amount of confidence guiding into the third quarter, then automotive will be pretty seasonal. William Stein Great. Thank you. Ali Husain Yes, no problem. Next question please. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Chris Danely Hey, thanks, guys. Congratulations on the good quarter and good guidance. Now that Linear is kind of lumped into the mix, how, if you could, frame the October quarter for the combined company just in terms of where combined OpEx could go? Could it go down again? And then also what should we expect for seasonality for revenue for the combined company for the October quarter? Ali Husain Yes. Okay, so let me try and parse that out a little bit and may be Vince can help me as well. But look from a – Chris, we have absolutely no visibility into the fourth quarter, the October quarter at this stage. So in the absence of any orders, all I can rely on is what seasonal trends tend to do and seasonally speaking industrial tends to be a little weaker in the fourth quarter. Automotive generally increases. Communications is always a wildcard just frankly depending on how the builds and the deployments are going. And then consumer generally has a pretty good growth quarter sequentially, because you start to see more of the builds taking place. So, that’s all I can tell you today, with absolutely zero visibility into the fourth quarter. What I would tell you on the OpEx side and I’d say it’s a fair point is on a standalone basis this quarter ADI had OpEx of $318 million. Linear Tech contributed $62 million in the quarter. I guess I would caution you on that number. One is obviously it’s a stub period and so it’s a partial quarter. And number two, there were public company costs that did come out of that number, which we have always talked about public company costs being somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million annually. And so the quarterly run-rate that we have guided to for operating expenses in the third quarter of $430 million to $440 million already includes those synergies embedded. Now to your other point, there are more synergies on the comp. We will start to see some of them. It will be very back end loaded there, Chris in the third quarter, but you will start to see more of them play out in the fourth quarter. And I would expect them to be then pretty linear back into the fourth quarter of 2018. If you recall, we have always talked about $100 million of OpEx synergies achieving that run-rate by the fourth quarter of 2018. I guess, what I am saying is $20 million of that is now baked into the third quarter run-rate number and there is still another $80 million to come, again on an annualized number as we go into the fourth quarter of 2018. Chris Danely Great. Do I get a follow-up? Ali Husain Of course. Chris Danely Thanks. Any update on the CFO – new CFO? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, let me tell you, Chris, we have – obviously we have retained a search firm. And what I can tell you is that we are making excellent progress right now. My expectation is that we will have the replacement named by the end of the fiscal year at the latest. But I am quite optimistic that we will be able to announce something quite well before then. So in the interim, I am taking a very hands-on approach with the integration of LT. And I am also relying with a terrific bench of people at ADI across all the facets of the management of the finance function of ADI. So, we can – we are very, very well positioned to ensure that we hit our targets in terms of the ongoing operation as well as the synergies. So, synergies are on track and we will update you on where we are at the Investor Day in the latter part of June here. Chris Danely Great. Thanks, guys. Ali Husain Thanks, Chris. Next caller, please. Operator Your next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani Thanks a lot. I guess just a question on the Linear side you have had this under your belt for a few months now. So I am curious when it comes to revenue synergies, where are you guys more focused on to drive revenue synergies, because I would imagine consumer might be the easiest place to get it or the quickest place to get it, but perhaps not the most ideal one for you. So, how do you think about the end markets and revenue synergies as you go forward? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, I think as we have talked about earlier on, the various markets, all of different cycles in terms of uptake, design cycles and adoption cycles. But I think obviously every sector in which we play, including consumer, has an opportunity for ADI to draw Linear Technology power management for additional revenue opportunity and growth. I would say it’s a medium-term to see the effect anyway of leveraging existing products and getting any meaningful revenue growth from those products is probably a 2 to 3-year proposition as we have experienced as well with Hittite. But I think the areas that we will see meaningful growth in the medium-term here will be automotive for sure. I think the communications sector will see a good uptick in the medium-term. Very judiciously as well, we are looking at some consumer opportunities. So obviously, those hit probably sooner than any other sector of the portfolio we manage. And I think industrial is 3 years plus from here. So I think that’s the way to think about the adoption of existing products and new sockets and the effect that we should see on revenue growth here. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Amit Daryanani I do, sir. I guess your consumer guide for July, modest sequential growth. I think last couple of years it’s been triple-digitish kind of number in the July quarter. The delta, do you think it’s due to later product launches in that segment or a change in the content that you guys have or maybe the OEMs that have more comfort around your ability around these products of asking you to do it a little bit later? It seems to be a fairly big delta, which we have seen the last 2 years at least. So, perhaps help us explain what’s driving that? Ali Husain Yes. So, I guess I will take that. I think we answered the question earlier in the call. I think this is definitely something that is, I would say more related to ADI. And we just have our content in various products are very much SKU dependent and we just think we will have a different kind of a mix this year relative to previous years. But I’d say as we progress into 2018, my expectation is that our B2B mix – our B2B markets expand as a percentage of total revenue as a result. Amit Daryanani Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter guys. Vincent Roche Thank you. Operator Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on your execution as you get started in the new area with Linear Tech. My question is regarding the synergies for the combined company. It’s clear, Vincent, that the company is quite happy with the way the early combined work is going. The question is does the progress on synergies thus far cause you to think differently about the linearity with which you expect to realize the $150 million in cost gains from the two companies? Vincent Roche No. I think when we have talked about synergies, we have been very clear that we have acquired LT for all its capabilities in terms of technology and customer management channel, channel management, operations and so on to drive revenue synergy over the long-term. But no, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, I am very pleased with the progress that we are making. We have – we had actually executed a lot of the decisions on the $150 million of synergies in advance of combining the companies. And the synergies are well-identified and the actions are in place to get the synergies executed. So my sense is it will take us, during the coming year, to really see the effects of the synergies in our P&L from a cost perspective. And a little bit longer than that I think as I have just been talking about to get the synergies from the cross-selling opportunities. Ali Husain Right, Craig, another follow-up? Craig Ellis Yes. Thanks for that Ali. And I follow-up on an end market, communications Vincent, I think you have mentioned 5G a couple of times and it seems like relative to 4G, the bigger picture is that, that seems to be more on track or maybe pulling in a little bit earlier versus what we had seen with some of the prior interface changes, but with regard to that opportunity, when would ADI expect 5G related infrastructure revenues to start to become a material part of its communications segment? Thank you. Vincent Roche I think your point is well taken. I think originally when we began talking about 5G, we were talking about it being a facet of our business in kind of 2020-plus. It now seems that we are obviously in trials right now with 5G, all the major application areas, all the major customers globally. So my own sense is that we will begin to see, I think a meaningful ramp in revenue in the 2019 kind of area. Maybe it’s a little sooner, maybe it’s a little later, but that’s my sense at this point in time that there is an aggressive pull in at the carrier level as well as the OEMs to make faster progress in deploying 5G. Ali Husain Alright. Craig, thank you. And we will get through our next caller. Operator Your next question is from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra Hi, good morning. You had mentioned that you recently that you have seen the small cell business finally picking up, what’s your market share in that business, which I am assuming has been fairly small and what type of growth are we looking and what type of revenue contribution can we get in the next say – in the next 12 months to 18 months? Ali Husain Yes. Hi Tristan, let me try and take a crack at that. I am sure Vince would be much more eloquent than I could ever be. But in any event, I would say on the small cell side, it’s been a relatively small contributor to our growth. I guess what we are particularly proud of are our integrated transceiver solutions that are picking up content both on macro base stations and in small cell base stations. So to be perfectly candid with you, we are pretty agnostic as to where these platforms end up. What is really important for ADI is the channel count. And so as long as you got more and more things that are connecting up, we tend to do extremely well when that happens. And so that could be a small cell, that could be a macro base station, but we are doing extremely well in the marketplace. We had another record quarter on top of our record quarter in the prior quarter in our integrated transceiver solutions that are just sucking up a lot of bill of materials and allowing us to gain share in this market. So interestingly you saw our results this quarter. And again it speaks to the diversity of our communications infrastructure market and our business. But our sequential revenue growth was led by wireless infrastructure and our year-over-year growth was led by wireline infrastructure. So you can see the diversity there. The other point I would make is with the addition of Linear Tech, our communications infrastructure business is more diversified than ever. In the past, about two-thirds of our calls business was wireless. At the current time, it’s more like 50-50. So I think we have the full suite of technology and we are pretty agnostic as to form factor. We have got the products and I think really it’s a question of as the market percolates, we are going to do extremely well. Vincent Roche Yes. I think just to add a little bit of color to what Ali has said, small cell is still a small activity from a market perspective. We are very, very well positioned. And I think it will start to accelerate so much during the course of the next 12 months to 18 months and become a more meaningful part of the overall wireless story in communications infrastructure. Ali Husain Alright. So you answered it better than I would. Thanks Tristan, do you have a follow-up? Tristan Gerra Yes, if I could. And thanks for the very useful answer. It looks like your Hittite business has grown fairly significantly since the close, could you provide some color on what’s been driving that growth, has it been share gain, new products or just distribution synergies and the question really relates to how should we look at Linear Tech in terms of the experience that you have gained with Hittite and the revenue growth achievement that you have done with Hittite? Vincent Roche Okay. Well, let me try and unpack. There were a couple of key questions there. I think with Hittite, we knew that the technology was very, very strong. And ADI, one of the big synergies we got from acquiring Hittite was just the channel reach, the customer reach and the channel reach that ADI had, that Hittite didn’t have. So we have been able to leverage that to tremendous effect. We knew that the portfolio products, was very, very strong. So, that’s been a huge help to us. Obviously, we have been able to architect. We have been together now almost 3 years and we have been able to architect some really new creative solutions in areas like aerospace and defense, phased array antenna, for example, these new radar systems that are being deployed as radar systems digitize across the globe. Even in instrumentation where a lot of the high-frequency systems require the combination of mix signal and microwave technology. Obviously, in the automotive sector where all these microwave technologies are being deployed, we are having the combination of ADI and Hittite there has been really, really powerful. So, I think it’s – it was a case of a lot of products that needed a new channel and a lot of re-architecting of customer systems based upon ADI’s signal processing mix signal strength and Hittite’s microwave strength. So what was the second part of that question? Ali Husain How would you leverage that to Linear? Vincent Roche So, leverage to Linear, I think the approach we have on the best of both was also true with Hittite. We tried to figure out how to be patient, understand the world class capabilities that Hittite had in terms of people and technology. And we have taken the very same approach with LTC. LTC is obviously a world class company as well. So just being patient, listening to create something greater than sum of the parts, build a whole new operating system across the company for speed and simplification. That’s what we did with Hittite and that’s what we are doing with LTC x5. Ali Husain Great. Thanks for the question. And we are zooming into the 11 o’clock hour here, so we are going to do our best to get to everybody. In case we can’t, feel free to call our Investor Relations phone at 781-461-3282. So we will continue until 11:00. Next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. You talked a bit about the trajectory of synergies on OpEx. What about on the $15 million in COGS? Can you give us fueling for how much of that, if any, is embedded in the Q3 guidance or where might we see that by the end of the year and should we expect a different trajectory of capturing those gross margin synergies versus what you are suggesting we should think about for the OpEx side? Ali Husain Yes, I know I’d say on the gross margin side, we are very early in the process. I’d say those are all very much on the comp. I wouldn’t expect to see those in Q3 or Q4 this year. Did you have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon I did. On the OpEx or just on the cost synergies, in general, it doesn’t sound like you are quite ready to take the target up. But can you give us a feeling given how far you are in the planning phase and which areas have proved maybe easier than you might have thought initially as well as more difficult? And if we were looking for potential upside, where do you think it might be easiest to squeeze more out? Vincent Roche Well, clearly we have been able to reduce the public company cost of the combined company. That’s one of the things that’s been executed pretty much straight away. I think we had talked before as well about an early retirement program that we had put in place at ADI and we begin to see the benefits of that fettering in over the next couple of quarters. But the – and obviously, distribution channel optimization as well that we had talked about before that will start to show benefits to us, I think towards the back end of this year and the early part of the coming year. So, there are just three or four examples of the things that we have already got in play that we will start to see the benefit of. And all the other synergies are identified. And we have got the actions in place and we are now just ready to realize them. Ali Husain Yes. And Stacy, I will just add we have talked about it before, but the EPS accretion in the third quarter is expected to be 15%. And I think if you start baking some of these synergies in the 2018, I think you get a number well north of that. So, we look forward to updating you on the model and any potential updates on the synergy target next month at the Analyst Meeting. Alright. I think we just hit the 11 o’clock hour.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava Hi, thank you very much for letting me ask questions. I had a medium-term question Ali and maybe you could answer that and then I had a longer term follow-up for Vince. So for the medium-term, could you please help us frame the consumer business, how – and when I say medium term, I am thinking how should we be thinking about this over the next 6 months to 18 months? And then I had a follow-up for Vince. Ali Husain Okay. Sure. Thanks Ambrish. Look I guess what I would tell you is our strategy in consumer is no different than our strategy in any of our markets. We focus on very tough problems that our customers have. We work to solve those for them. We try and create as much value as possible for our customers. And in turn that tends to generate a lot of free cash flow for ADI. I would say the only difference in consumer, relative to our other markets is that the product life cycles tend to be a little bit shorter. But apart from that, I would say the strategy at ADI is very, very consistent across all of our markets. Now you have seen that strategy play out over the last couple of years. We have grown our consumer business nicely. It’s generated a lot of free cash flow for the company. We have diversified our position in consumer both at our large customer. We have diversified our position across many other customers and into new vectors of growth that we think will drive consumer free cash flow and revenue growth over the long-term. All that being said, you know as well as I do that the consumer market tends to have shorter lifecycles. And so as a result, you can’t have periods of time where you have got some older designs that are rolling off and there is a bit of a pause between that happening and newer designs rolling on. My sense is that we are likely in one of those periods at the current time. I expect as a result, our mix of B2B markets to expand as a percentage of our revenue as we get into the back half of 2017. And I would expect that to continue into 2018 as well. I guess, the only other point I would make is just to provide a little bit more context, Ambrish, is we manage a very complex mix of portfolios and businesses at ADI. Each one of them have different lifecycles. Each one of them have different revenue growth profiles. Each one of them have different profitability profiles. But what I would tell you is as long as ADI is focusing on very tough solved problems to solve for our customers and we can drive a lot of free cash flow. And frankly, if we are meeting our hurdle rates and we can drive really good long-term profitable growth in free cash flow, we will play, because ultimately that’s the measure. Vince mentioned it in the prepared remarks we are now a top 5% S&P 500 free cash flow generator. And our goal is to drive that even higher from here. Operator Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First clarification, in terms of the revenue guide, was that combined or did that exclude old Linear? And then I guess as my main question just to follow-up on Ambrish’s question around consumer. Is that a business looking into calendar ‘17 and ‘18 that can grow given that you have brought on diversification increase to customer or is that something that we should be thinking about declining over the next 1, 2 years? Ali Husain Okay. So I think that was your first question and a follow-up. So, I think on the revenue side, we have provided combined company guidance for both companies and the range is $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion that would imply a midpoint of $1.41 billion. And I guess if you were just to think about how that flows by end markets, C.J., we expect the industrial market again had a very good second quarter. We expect that strength to continue into the third quarter. As a result, we are expecting industrial to grow somewhere in the low to mid single-digits sequentially in the third quarter, which again would be better than seasonal. Automotive, we are expecting a pretty seasonal quarter. So, as a result that would decline kind of in the mid single-digits sequentially. Communications is implied to be relatively stable. And on the consumer side, we are expecting modest sequential growth relative to the second quarter. And Vince, did you want to take the question about consumer implied growth in 2017 and 2018? Vincent Roche Yes. I think as Ali said, we experienced fundamentally shorter lifecycles in the consumer markets. And we have been working very, very hard over the last couple of years to diversify our product base and our customer base, the application base within consumer and we are making good progress of that. I think as we look into the third quarter, as Ali said, we are seeing modest sequential revenue growth, but nonetheless below what we would consider to be seasonal norms. So we are probably in a slower growth environment in the consumer business for the near-term here. Ali Husain And I’d say, C.J., if I could just add two points. One is we do expect as a result, our B2B markets to expand as a percentage of total revenue. And I think as you look into 2018, the accretion from the Linear Tech deal is very strong here in the third quarter, about 15%. And given some of the synergies that we have talked about, we expect that EPS accretion to accelerate into 2018 and I think that would be a very strong result. So, can we get to our next caller? Operator Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur Good morning. Congratulations on the strong results. Given the stronger industrial demand flow and outlook for continued growth, just wondering if you guys are seeing any component tightness or lead time stretching out? I know a few of your peers have highlighted some tightness. I am just – it sounds like you guys still have more room to grow on utilization, but wanted to get your views on the supply side situation? Ali Husain Thanks. Good question, Harlan, one that we obviously think about a lot as well. But I would tell you, we are delivering the vast majority of our products within our stated lead times of 4 to 6 weeks. That frankly hasn’t changed all that much over the last several quarters. I guess, what I would tell you is that ADI we are very focused on providing the highest levels of customer service and support and part of that service and support model is to deliver products when we tell our customers that we are going to deliver them. And so we tend to keep our lead times pretty short, 4 to 6 weeks delivering the vast majority of our products within those stated lead times. And I guess, I would also tell you that we are carrying 3.5 months worth of inventory in our balance sheet, which I think is a fair amount of inventory to help supply our customers with the products. The only one other point I perhaps make in this front is that if you recall back in 2016, we did bring our utilization rates down pretty hard. And the reason we did that is we wanted to manage our DSI or days of inventory down. And we managed the impact on gross margins by making permanent improvements in our cost structure. And I think as you now look out to 2017 and 2018, I think what investors should expect from ADI is a nice benefit on the drop-throughs, because as we are building the inventory, the drop-throughs are certainly better. But I guess, just coming back to your earlier point on the lead times, vast majority delivered within 4 to 6 weeks and we are keeping up high levels of service to our customers. Did you have a follow-up? Harlan Sur No, I’m good. Thank you. Ali Husain Okay. Operator Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach Yes, thank you. Question for Vince, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments around automotive with Linear Tech. And more specifically, can you talk about how expansive your opportunity set is, so if there is any examples of things that you think they will help you expand the content within automotive? Vincent Roche Yes. So automotive for us is a story of continuing content gain here for both LTC and for ADI. So, we see it as a key growth market for the combined companies. So I think we have talked before about ADI having great strength in emerging applications like, for example, 77-gigahertz radar, LIDAR infotainment with our A2B technology, for example, bringing new technologies into the powertrain, such as the rotationals and Linear sensing, magnetic devices. And as the powertrain electrifies being able to get our battery management technologies in there as well. So, I think both LTC and ADI have a lot of complimentary capability, for example, to the ADI signal chains that I have just talked about here, we are adding LTC power management capability. And the outcome of that is we can architect an optimized solution for each of the sub-applications here for the automotive customers. And there is great complementarity between the signal chain and the power chain. So I think that’s looking very, very good. And also, there is a lot of new power management things that we are looking at independent of signal chains that LT will be instrumental in helping us nail down over the coming few years. So, there is a tremendous amount of benefit in coupling power management with the signal chain. And every single application which we play within the transportation automotive sector requires both signal chain and power management. And what I am seeing so far is the tremendous level of collaboration between the applications teams, the design teams and really grabbing the opportunities here with both hands. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Craig. Did you have a follow-up? Craig Hettenbach Yes. I guess just a brief one, just on the integration, good to hear that it’s on track and kind of good start out of the gate. Just any comments in terms of culture, key people and kind of milestones we should be aware of? Vincent Roche Well, we have known that LT is a very, very high-quality company. And I have been obviously hands on involved in the integration of the two companies. I am very, very impressed by the quality of the people throughout LT and I am also very impressed with just how fast both companies are coming together to create something better than the sum of the parts. So right now, we are laser focused on leveraging the combined strengths of both companies to generate this long-term profitable growth possibility that we know is there. And we are taking our time to really figure out – we have been very, very patient at figuring out how to combine the leadership – we have combined the leadership teams, but we have been very patient in trying to figure out what the best of both really means here. So I think to answer your question, very directly here Craig, we are culturally I think in good shape. Our values as I have talked about many times before, the values around technology and business and customer are very, very similar. And in creating this best of both, we are actually leveraging the differences in the way the operating routines of both companies to draw from, to create something greater than some of the parts. So we are focused as I said on delighting our customers, ensuring that we are capturing the upside demand here. And I think overall the – once the values are compatible, as I said I am using the cultural differences to create something greater than the sum of the parts. And the LT leadership is playing a key role. I have got two members of the senior LTC staff and my staff. And the LT leaders are contributing to this new company multiple levels down at this point in time. Craig Hettenbach Great. Thanks. Ali Husain Thank you. We will get to our next caller. Operator And our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Vincent Roche You are back, good. Ambrish Srivastava Hi. Thank you. I had my follow-up keyed up. For some reason I got dropped off. Thanks for accommodating me back. I wanted to get back to the capital allocation and the free cash flow, it seems like the free cash flow generating ability might be higher than at least what our models were suggesting. So could you please remind us just in terms of capital allocation and the timing for the pay down, obviously the leverage ratio was lower than what you had communicated and what it was at the deal close, so any light on that would be very helpful? Thank you. Ali Husain Okay, fair enough. I will leave the key take away for next month when we present to you at the Analyst Day, because I think we want to save a little bit of dry powder for that. But what I would tell you is since we announced the acquisition, there is a couple of things. One is we set out this target of 3.8x net debt to EBITDA. And then a typical ADI fashion, we put out targets and we had executed extremely aggressively against those targets. And part of it is just coming out at a lower leverage ratio is just a function of the mindset at ADIs. We execute extremely aggressively against the targets that we lay out. Part of it is like business conditions have been better and as a result, we have generated more cash flow. And part of it frankly is just having a laser focus on operational efficiencies. And so that’s driven a lot of good cash flow as well. The good news I guess from a leverage perspective as we have talked about is we are certainly well ahead of schedule in terms of the de-leveraging plan. The bogie we are shooting for is 2x net debt to EBITDA and I would say we are probably ahead of schedule in trying to hit that number. Once we get to that number, I think we have been pretty public in terms of saying, look we are going to turn the share buyback program back on. In the meanwhile the dividend remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation strategy. And then the only other last point I would make is and again this kind of supports the notion of that we are ahead of schedule is after the quarter ended, we did pay $200 million down on the $5 billion term loan balance. So I think we are certainly ahead of schedule and in very good shape on that front. Ambrish Srivastava Okay. Thank you very much. Ali Husain Okay, great. Operator Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. So the industrial market is growing very strongly, I believe you mentioned 20% year-over-year, how much of that is the market coming back versus perhaps more electronic content or even some share gains? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. I think it’s true to say that first off we are recovering from a relatively weak environment in the prior year. So the compare is kind of easy from that perspective. From everything that we can tell right now, the growth is broad based across all the industrial sectors and in fact across all the geographies as well. And I think that’s just a function of the better business environment versus last year overall. And if you just paying attention to our own customers as well, they are all guiding for low to high single-digit growth in 2017. As a company, several years ago, we made a strategic pivot in terms of where we placed our R&D, putting more into B2B applications. And industrial has been a great beneficiary of that. So I think just given the cycles in the industrial sector in general, we are beginning to see some of those products really contribute in a meaningful way across factory and process automation, aerospace and defense, the instrumentation ATE business. And so I think the business environment is overall better, but we are also doing better in terms of grabbing share through the effects of our new product investments over the last several years. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. Vince, you also mentioned earlier that you plan to leverage Linear Technology into the wireless infrastructure market, I was just hoping you could elaborate just a little bit more on that because certainly, that’s a market that’s been weaker the last 2 years, but I assume with 5G coming on, your plan is to leverage both entities to participate in that market? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. Well, we are – as ADI organic, we have been doing better and better in terms of building solutions for our customers from antenna right down to bits, leveraging the strength of ADI and Hittite combined. And we know that as customers put greater and greater pressure on for more integration, to be able to solve the noise problems more effectively in these radio systems, that power management is going to be a great help to us. And already, I think in the shorter term, we are being actively engaged in discussions to use existing products with ADI solutions, for example, in the transceiver space, in 5G systems, leveraging LTE’s power technology. And that’s only the beginning because over the coming generations when we can start to architect the radio solutions now with the new advances in power management technology that LT has been making, I think we can have several generations here of success in both the wired and the wireless business in the years ahead. And there is no doubt there is tremendous symbiosis between the signal chain technologies that ADI has been so strong in over the years with the power technologies that LT now brings to the table. So the conversations with our customers are very active and with existing products and we are now plotting the next new architectures based on the combination of the two companies. Tore Svanberg Alright. Thank you. Ali Husain Thank you very much. Next question please. Operator Your next question is from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks for taking my question. I am hoping you can expand on something you touched on earlier, the cultural differences, however may be they are not as great as some people perceive, but I think one of them is that Linear was known for having an intense focus on gross profit margin and perhaps that limited that business’ revenue growth and I think ADI has a more growthy sort of outlook. So I am wondering if you can sort of highlight any initial opportunities to expand the growth rate on the Linear business? Vincent Roche Yes. It’s a good question. It’s true that both companies have had very, very strong focus on gross margin. I think it’s a great kind of proxy for the quality of the innovation that you are developing, the price you can command and ultimately, the gross margins that you can get. So what I will say is that ADI has probably just – given our buying power, their operational focus. We have combined now with LT we have got more buying power. So we can be more flexible in terms of taking some market share with products already available without sacrificing the margins, just giving the signings of the so called bill of materials that we are now sourcing across both companies. So we don’t intend to drop our standards, but we do intend to be aggressive in terms of leveraging all the available products and technologies that we have to grow our business profitably. I think that’s the way to think about it. Ali Husain And did you have any follow-up, Will? William Stein I did. One of the issues from the integration that’s always important in any of these transactions is ERP, and by the disclosure around end markets that sort of lumps the Linear Tech revenue in its own category maybe a sign that perhaps that’s going to take a bit of time to reflect their revenue across your end markets. Any guidance or commentary as to when we should see that disclosed sort of on a combined basis and just in general the update on that aspect of the integration? Ali Husain Yes, fair enough. I can take part of that. Look, from an ERP’s perspective and frankly from an integration perspective, we are generally keeping Linear Tech on a standalone basis for the first year. And then we will converge. With regards specifically to the end market question, we actually have the data. I just didn’t feel like it was that meaningful for a stub quarter and I can certainly talk to it right now in the call. But you should expect from ADI next quarter that we have all of the disclosures by end markets mapped out and that’s absolutely no issue to do. What I would tell you in the quarter, had Linear been part of ADI for a full quarter, they would have seen their industrial business grow and they would have seen their automotive business decrease sequentially given their exposure to the powertrain market, specifically in transportation in China, which has been a weaker market. But the good news there I’d say well is that, that market is actually pretty stable right now and that gives us a fair amount of confidence guiding into the third quarter, then automotive will be pretty seasonal. William Stein Great. Thank you. Ali Husain Yes, no problem. Next question please. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Chris Danely Hey, thanks, guys. Congratulations on the good quarter and good guidance. Now that Linear is kind of lumped into the mix, how, if you could, frame the October quarter for the combined company just in terms of where combined OpEx could go? Could it go down again? And then also what should we expect for seasonality for revenue for the combined company for the October quarter? Ali Husain Yes. Okay, so let me try and parse that out a little bit and may be Vince can help me as well. But look from a – Chris, we have absolutely no visibility into the fourth quarter, the October quarter at this stage. So in the absence of any orders, all I can rely on is what seasonal trends tend to do and seasonally speaking industrial tends to be a little weaker in the fourth quarter. Automotive generally increases. Communications is always a wildcard just frankly depending on how the builds and the deployments are going. And then consumer generally has a pretty good growth quarter sequentially, because you start to see more of the builds taking place. So, that’s all I can tell you today, with absolutely zero visibility into the fourth quarter. What I would tell you on the OpEx side and I’d say it’s a fair point is on a standalone basis this quarter ADI had OpEx of $318 million. Linear Tech contributed $62 million in the quarter. I guess I would caution you on that number. One is obviously it’s a stub period and so it’s a partial quarter. And number two, there were public company costs that did come out of that number, which we have always talked about public company costs being somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million annually. And so the quarterly run-rate that we have guided to for operating expenses in the third quarter of $430 million to $440 million already includes those synergies embedded. Now to your other point, there are more synergies on the comp. We will start to see some of them. It will be very back end loaded there, Chris in the third quarter, but you will start to see more of them play out in the fourth quarter. And I would expect them to be then pretty linear back into the fourth quarter of 2018. If you recall, we have always talked about $100 million of OpEx synergies achieving that run-rate by the fourth quarter of 2018. I guess, what I am saying is $20 million of that is now baked into the third quarter run-rate number and there is still another $80 million to come, again on an annualized number as we go into the fourth quarter of 2018. Chris Danely Great. Do I get a follow-up? Ali Husain Of course. Chris Danely Thanks. Any update on the CFO – new CFO? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, let me tell you, Chris, we have – obviously we have retained a search firm. And what I can tell you is that we are making excellent progress right now. My expectation is that we will have the replacement named by the end of the fiscal year at the latest. But I am quite optimistic that we will be able to announce something quite well before then. So in the interim, I am taking a very hands-on approach with the integration of LT. And I am also relying with a terrific bench of people at ADI across all the facets of the management of the finance function of ADI. So, we can – we are very, very well positioned to ensure that we hit our targets in terms of the ongoing operation as well as the synergies. So, synergies are on track and we will update you on where we are at the Investor Day in the latter part of June here. Chris Danely Great. Thanks, guys. Ali Husain Thanks, Chris. Next caller, please. Operator Your next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani Thanks a lot. I guess just a question on the Linear side you have had this under your belt for a few months now. So I am curious when it comes to revenue synergies, where are you guys more focused on to drive revenue synergies, because I would imagine consumer might be the easiest place to get it or the quickest place to get it, but perhaps not the most ideal one for you. So, how do you think about the end markets and revenue synergies as you go forward? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, I think as we have talked about earlier on, the various markets, all of different cycles in terms of uptake, design cycles and adoption cycles. But I think obviously every sector in which we play, including consumer, has an opportunity for ADI to draw Linear Technology power management for additional revenue opportunity and growth. I would say it’s a medium-term to see the effect anyway of leveraging existing products and getting any meaningful revenue growth from those products is probably a 2 to 3-year proposition as we have experienced as well with Hittite. But I think the areas that we will see meaningful growth in the medium-term here will be automotive for sure. I think the communications sector will see a good uptick in the medium-term. Very judiciously as well, we are looking at some consumer opportunities. So obviously, those hit probably sooner than any other sector of the portfolio we manage. And I think industrial is 3 years plus from here. So I think that’s the way to think about the adoption of existing products and new sockets and the effect that we should see on revenue growth here. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Amit Daryanani I do, sir. I guess your consumer guide for July, modest sequential growth. I think last couple of years it’s been triple-digitish kind of number in the July quarter. The delta, do you think it’s due to later product launches in that segment or a change in the content that you guys have or maybe the OEMs that have more comfort around your ability around these products of asking you to do it a little bit later? It seems to be a fairly big delta, which we have seen the last 2 years at least. So, perhaps help us explain what’s driving that? Ali Husain Yes. So, I guess I will take that. I think we answered the question earlier in the call. I think this is definitely something that is, I would say more related to ADI. And we just have our content in various products are very much SKU dependent and we just think we will have a different kind of a mix this year relative to previous years. But I’d say as we progress into 2018, my expectation is that our B2B mix – our B2B markets expand as a percentage of total revenue as a result. Amit Daryanani Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter guys. Vincent Roche Thank you. Operator Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on your execution as you get started in the new area with Linear Tech. My question is regarding the synergies for the combined company. It’s clear, Vincent, that the company is quite happy with the way the early combined work is going. The question is does the progress on synergies thus far cause you to think differently about the linearity with which you expect to realize the $150 million in cost gains from the two companies? Vincent Roche No. I think when we have talked about synergies, we have been very clear that we have acquired LT for all its capabilities in terms of technology and customer management channel, channel management, operations and so on to drive revenue synergy over the long-term. But no, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, I am very pleased with the progress that we are making. We have – we had actually executed a lot of the decisions on the $150 million of synergies in advance of combining the companies. And the synergies are well-identified and the actions are in place to get the synergies executed. So my sense is it will take us, during the coming year, to really see the effects of the synergies in our P&L from a cost perspective. And a little bit longer than that I think as I have just been talking about to get the synergies from the cross-selling opportunities. Ali Husain Right, Craig, another follow-up? Craig Ellis Yes. Thanks for that Ali. And I follow-up on an end market, communications Vincent, I think you have mentioned 5G a couple of times and it seems like relative to 4G, the bigger picture is that, that seems to be more on track or maybe pulling in a little bit earlier versus what we had seen with some of the prior interface changes, but with regard to that opportunity, when would ADI expect 5G related infrastructure revenues to start to become a material part of its communications segment? Thank you. Vincent Roche I think your point is well taken. I think originally when we began talking about 5G, we were talking about it being a facet of our business in kind of 2020-plus. It now seems that we are obviously in trials right now with 5G, all the major application areas, all the major customers globally. So my own sense is that we will begin to see, I think a meaningful ramp in revenue in the 2019 kind of area. Maybe it’s a little sooner, maybe it’s a little later, but that’s my sense at this point in time that there is an aggressive pull in at the carrier level as well as the OEMs to make faster progress in deploying 5G. Ali Husain Alright. Craig, thank you. And we will get through our next caller. Operator Your next question is from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra Hi, good morning. You had mentioned that you recently that you have seen the small cell business finally picking up, what’s your market share in that business, which I am assuming has been fairly small and what type of growth are we looking and what type of revenue contribution can we get in the next say – in the next 12 months to 18 months? Ali Husain Yes. Hi Tristan, let me try and take a crack at that. I am sure Vince would be much more eloquent than I could ever be. But in any event, I would say on the small cell side, it’s been a relatively small contributor to our growth. I guess what we are particularly proud of are our integrated transceiver solutions that are picking up content both on macro base stations and in small cell base stations. So to be perfectly candid with you, we are pretty agnostic as to where these platforms end up. What is really important for ADI is the channel count. And so as long as you got more and more things that are connecting up, we tend to do extremely well when that happens. And so that could be a small cell, that could be a macro base station, but we are doing extremely well in the marketplace. We had another record quarter on top of our record quarter in the prior quarter in our integrated transceiver solutions that are just sucking up a lot of bill of materials and allowing us to gain share in this market. So interestingly you saw our results this quarter. And again it speaks to the diversity of our communications infrastructure market and our business. But our sequential revenue growth was led by wireless infrastructure and our year-over-year growth was led by wireline infrastructure. So you can see the diversity there. The other point I would make is with the addition of Linear Tech, our communications infrastructure business is more diversified than ever. In the past, about two-thirds of our calls business was wireless. At the current time, it’s more like 50-50. So I think we have the full suite of technology and we are pretty agnostic as to form factor. We have got the products and I think really it’s a question of as the market percolates, we are going to do extremely well. Vincent Roche Yes. I think just to add a little bit of color to what Ali has said, small cell is still a small activity from a market perspective. We are very, very well positioned. And I think it will start to accelerate so much during the course of the next 12 months to 18 months and become a more meaningful part of the overall wireless story in communications infrastructure. Ali Husain Alright. So you answered it better than I would. Thanks Tristan, do you have a follow-up? Tristan Gerra Yes, if I could. And thanks for the very useful answer. It looks like your Hittite business has grown fairly significantly since the close, could you provide some color on what’s been driving that growth, has it been share gain, new products or just distribution synergies and the question really relates to how should we look at Linear Tech in terms of the experience that you have gained with Hittite and the revenue growth achievement that you have done with Hittite? Vincent Roche Okay. Well, let me try and unpack. There were a couple of key questions there. I think with Hittite, we knew that the technology was very, very strong. And ADI, one of the big synergies we got from acquiring Hittite was just the channel reach, the customer reach and the channel reach that ADI had, that Hittite didn’t have. So we have been able to leverage that to tremendous effect. We knew that the portfolio products, was very, very strong. So, that’s been a huge help to us. Obviously, we have been able to architect. We have been together now almost 3 years and we have been able to architect some really new creative solutions in areas like aerospace and defense, phased array antenna, for example, these new radar systems that are being deployed as radar systems digitize across the globe. Even in instrumentation where a lot of the high-frequency systems require the combination of mix signal and microwave technology. Obviously, in the automotive sector where all these microwave technologies are being deployed, we are having the combination of ADI and Hittite there has been really, really powerful. So, I think it’s – it was a case of a lot of products that needed a new channel and a lot of re-architecting of customer systems based upon ADI’s signal processing mix signal strength and Hittite’s microwave strength. So what was the second part of that question? Ali Husain How would you leverage that to Linear? Vincent Roche So, leverage to Linear, I think the approach we have on the best of both was also true with Hittite. We tried to figure out how to be patient, understand the world class capabilities that Hittite had in terms of people and technology. And we have taken the very same approach with LTC. LTC is obviously a world class company as well. So just being patient, listening to create something greater than sum of the parts, build a whole new operating system across the company for speed and simplification. That’s what we did with Hittite and that’s what we are doing with LTC x5. Ali Husain Great. Thanks for the question. And we are zooming into the 11 o’clock hour here, so we are going to do our best to get to everybody. In case we can’t, feel free to call our Investor Relations phone at 781-461-3282. So we will continue until 11:00. Next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. You talked a bit about the trajectory of synergies on OpEx. What about on the $15 million in COGS? Can you give us fueling for how much of that, if any, is embedded in the Q3 guidance or where might we see that by the end of the year and should we expect a different trajectory of capturing those gross margin synergies versus what you are suggesting we should think about for the OpEx side? Ali Husain Yes, I know I’d say on the gross margin side, we are very early in the process. I’d say those are all very much on the comp. I wouldn’t expect to see those in Q3 or Q4 this year. Did you have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon I did. On the OpEx or just on the cost synergies, in general, it doesn’t sound like you are quite ready to take the target up. But can you give us a feeling given how far you are in the planning phase and which areas have proved maybe easier than you might have thought initially as well as more difficult? And if we were looking for potential upside, where do you think it might be easiest to squeeze more out? Vincent Roche Well, clearly we have been able to reduce the public company cost of the combined company. That’s one of the things that’s been executed pretty much straight away. I think we had talked before as well about an early retirement program that we had put in place at ADI and we begin to see the benefits of that fettering in over the next couple of quarters. But the – and obviously, distribution channel optimization as well that we had talked about before that will start to show benefits to us, I think towards the back end of this year and the early part of the coming year. So, there are just three or four examples of the things that we have already got in play that we will start to see the benefit of. And all the other synergies are identified. And we have got the actions in place and we are now just ready to realize them. Ali Husain Yes. And Stacy, I will just add we have talked about it before, but the EPS accretion in the third quarter is expected to be 15%. And I think if you start baking some of these synergies in the 2018, I think you get a number well north of that. So, we look forward to updating you on the model and any potential updates on the synergy target next month at the Analyst Meeting. Alright. I think we just hit the 11 o’clock hour. So listen, thank you everybody for joining us this morning.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the floor over to David Gennarelli, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. David Gennarelli Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter of full-year FY2017. On the line are Co-CEO's, Amarpreet Hanspal and Andrew Anagnost; and Scott Herren, our CFO. Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor. As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments and we will not repeat them on this call. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the Company such as our guidance for the first quarter and full-year fiscal 2018, our long-term financial model guidance, the factors we use to estimate our guidance including currency headwinds, our transition to new business models, our customer value, cost structure, our market opportunities and strategies and trends for various products, geographies and industries. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2016, our Form 10-Q for the period ended October 31, 2016 and our current reports on Form 8-K, including the 8-K filed with today's press release and prepared remarks. Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks, and on the Investor Relations section of our website. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, unless otherwise noted each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Amar. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks Dave. We rounded out a fantastic year with strong fourth quarter results. New model ARR grew 109% at constant currency. New model subscriptions grew by a record 227,000 sequentially. Recurring revenue jumped to 84% of total revenue and we are beginning to see meaningful volume in our cloud services. It's clear that we are making real progress in our two major initiatives, growing lifetime customer value by moving customers to the subscription model and increasing adoption of our cloud-based solutions. Let's dive into the numbers a little more. For the quarter, we added 154,000 net subscriptions bringing the total additions for the year to 530,000. Total subscriptions at the end of the year stood at 3.11 million, an increase of 21%. We are really pleased with the continued momentum of new model subscription additions, which grew more than 3.5 times as compared to Q4 of last year. Bear in mind, we accomplished this without having a significant promotion in the market during Q4, so we are really pleased with the overall demand for product subscriptions. Taking a closer look at new models subscription, once again product subscriptions drove the majority of the new model sub-addition as will likely be the case in most quarters. New customers represented about a third of our new product subscriptions for the quarter, which is a consistent trend we've been seeing. These new customers come from mix of market expansion, growth in emerging countries, former pirates and people who may have been using an alternate design or simulation tool. It's clear that a subscription model is broadening our market opportunity. We are experiencing continued success with the EBA program in our enterprise named accounts. EBA subscription additions more than doubled over Q4 last year and total EBA subs grew over 40% for the year. Q4 has always been our biggest quarter for signing large transactions with our enterprise customers and this quarter was no exception. We signed nearly 70 deals worth more than $1 million and over 50 of these were EBAs. The EBA deal volume was up 50% over Q4 of last year and this is a clear sign that we are successfully and effectively moving our biggest customers to the new model. It's important to remember that these EBAs help drive subscription growth going forward. Since we introduced EBAs customer that are moved from our older license agreement to the token-based EBA have resulted in subscriptions nearly three times higher than before. Keep in mind, that most of the EBAs we signed up in Q4, won't start contributing to the subs account under Q1 of this year consistent with prior years. Our product subscriptions in EBA subscriptions are the business model transition part of our story. The third component of our new model subscription is our cloud products. This is a TAM expansion part of our transition and we continue to build on our leadership in the cloud. We had a record quarter for the cloud, adding three times more cloud subscriptions than in any other quarter in our history. Cloud subscription was driven by BIM 360. Our BIM management and collaboration tool closely followed by Fusion, our cloud-based designs, simulation, and fabrication tool. For the year, cloud subscriptions grew more than 150%. BIM 360 continues to gain momentum with big wins at large construction companies. A perfect example of this is a multi-million dollar Q4 deal with a large U.S. based contractor. Historically, this customer had been a relatively minor user of some of our design tools like Revit, AutoCAD and Navisworks. Over the past couple of years, they've been expanding the deployment and utilization of BIM 360 and their new contract covers an 8,000 subscription mix of BIM 360, Field, Glue and Docs to be used in 95% of their projects. More than anything else this transaction illustrates strengthening alignment with builders and contractors enabling us to reach parts of the $10 trillion construction market like never before. I also want to note that in Q4, we launched Fusion Ultimate which provides enterprise level customers access to advanced design, simulation and manufacturing capabilities. The list price for an annual subscription to Fusion Ultimate is $1500 which includes consumption credits and this provides us with new opportunities to continue to introduce cutting edge products to our customers, now partly offsetting the growth in new model subscriptions with the expected decline in maintenance subscription. The fourth quarter has long had the biggest pool of renewal opportunities, so with the maintenance renewal rates similar to our recent trends and no new maintenance agreements being sold, the sequential step up in attrition was as expected. As we said in the past, we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance subscriptions going forward. Now the rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions that come up for renewal, the renewal rate at the time and our ability to incent maintenance customers to switch over to EBAs or to products subscription. And that's a perfect segway for me to turn things over to Andrew to talk about ARR and ARPS. Importantly, Andrew will also cover our new program to incent those maintenance customers to move to subscription. Andrew? Andrew Anagnost Thanks, Amar. When we started the business model transition, we indicated the subscription growth was a key metric for tracking our progress. Clearly we feel good about the trends we are seeing with subscription, but ultimately if the growth in ARR that will enable us to achieve our free cash flow goals. So we are happy to report the trends we are seeing in both are positive. New model ARR growth surged to 109% on a constant currency basis and reflects the continued strong uptake of all of our new model subscription offerings. The total ARR grew 19% of constant currency and about one-third of our total ARR is now driven by new model subscription. That's up from just 19% in Q4 of last year and it's a clear indicator of significant progress we’ve made this year. You might also recall at the Investor Day, I said that we would start to see ARPS trending up in the second half of the FY2018. In Q4 2017, we did experience a sequential increase in ARPS, but this does not indicate a permanent trend or an inflection point. As you recall in Q1 and Q3 we had a successful legacy promo which brought in a lot of subscriptions at lower ARPS. We did not run a promo in Q4 and that positively impacted ARPS. Going forward, the ARPS calculation will continue to be extremely sensitive to short-term shifts and term length, geo mix, promotions et cetera. We expect to see ARPS walk up or down on a quarterly basis and it will not increase monotonically throughout the year. Now I want to pick up where Amar left off regarding our maintenance subscription base and build on my comments from Investor Day. At the end of Q4, we had just over 2 million maintenance subscriptions. Starting today we are starting taking a number of steps to encourage these customers to move the product subscription and to do so sooner rather than later. We want the best for these customers and product subscription provide them the greatest value and access to our offerings. So let me get into the information that you've been asking for since we talked about this in Investor Day. Information we just communicated to our customers and channel partners this morning. Beginning in June, maintenance customers can move to product subscription for a loyalty discount of 60% less than the cost of a new product subscription. This discount will decrease by 5% for each of the following two years, so the earlier the customer switches the more they'll safe. This discount allows the maintenance customers to move to subscription at a 5% increase over their current price and lock that price in for three years in exchange for turning in their perpetual license. A maintenance customer can choose the stay on maintenance, but they will be subject to a 5% increase this year, a 10% increase in FY2019 and a 20% increase in FY2020. In addition, maintenance customers will no longer be able to purchase multi-year contracts. So why these customers going to move, product subscription offers the greatest value to our customers that provide increased flexibility, support and access to our cloud products and the loyalty pricing will be a big driver. This program wins all the right elements, a customer friendly element with the loyalty price and the pressure driver of the maintenance price increases. It's a simple program, partners know how to run it, the sales force knows how to run it, and they're highly motivated to do it well. Beyond that, the program offers our customers the most attractive pricing for moving to collections they will ever see and we expect many customers to move their standalone maintenance fees to collections. And it also important to remember that the maintenance customer will be subject to a 5% increase this year whether they take advantage of the loyalty pricing and move to product subscription or if they stick with their traditional maintenance. This migration will be good for both Autodesk and our customers as it moves into the newest and best product experience. Now, I'll turn it over to Scott for a closer look at some of the financials. Scott Herren Thanks Andrew. All of you should have the prepared remarks document, which is the best source for our financial details. So I'm not going to walk through them all, but I do want to hit on a couple of noteworthy items and talk about our business outlook for fiscal 2018. Starting with revenue total direct revenue for the fourth quarter increased once again and represented 32% of total revenues. That's up from 23% in Q4 last year and just 19% two years ago. That's a lot of progress over a relatively short period of time as we continue to grow the volume of business with both our large enterprise customers as well as on our e-store. As we indicated we believe there is still room for our direct business to grow over the next few years as we progress on the model transition. Moving to spend management, we're really proud of what we've accomplished on the expense side. We started the year with a goal of keeping non-GAAP spend flat to down 1% we ended up reducing it by 3% for the fiscal year and 4% in the fourth quarter. We accomplish this by making sure we're investing in critical elements of our transition by reducing standard other areas. Part of the reduction this year was the result of the restructuring we announced at the beginning of the year, coupled with a relentless focus on driving efficiencies across the organization. We significantly reduced our M&A activity this year and we've been simplifying the product portfolio. We remain committed to keeping spend flat through fiscal 2019 and believe that we can do so without compromising the long-term health of the company. During this stage of our transition, deferred revenue is a better measure of our business than reported revenue. Total deferred revenue grew 18% against the tough compare last year when we attached very high percentage of maintenance contracts along with the last sale of perpetual licenses for individual products. As I mentioned in December, the work we've been doing over the past several quarters on our operating structure has allowed us to move about $1.7 billion of our offshore cash into foreign subsidiaries that are branches of Autodesk U.S. If we look at our cash balance at quarter end approximately 85% can be used without incremental U.S. tax that equates to $1.9 billion. Of course we need to keep some of our cash for operating needs but we intend to put the majority of it into our stock buyback program and execute on that over the next several quarters using both programmatic and opportunistic means. We've been increasing our buyback this year and in Q4 we repurchased 2.9 million shares. For the year we repurchased nearly10 million shares resulting in a reduction of over 4 million. We're making steady progress on this front and over the past two years of reduced our basic share count by about 3%. Overall we're extremely pleased with our Q4 and full-year fiscal 2017 results. We have increased confidence of the transition is working for our customers, for our partners and for Autodesk and they were on track for the fiscal 2020 targets we set. I turn now to our outlook our view of the global economic conditions remains consistent with our view of the past several quarters, but most of the mature markets performing relatively well, but many of the emerging markets have been challenging. We continue to monitor for changes in Europe stemming from Brexit, but today we have not experienced any impact. With the new administration in the U.S. it's far too early to determine any impact from proposed policy changes around tax reform, trade in tariffs, infrastructure spend or whatever the next executive order might be. As we look ahead to fiscal 2018, it will be our first full-year in the subscription only model and as such we believe it's prudent to take an appropriately conservative approach to our outlook for the year, while remaining confident in our ability to achieve our long-term targets. Here our primary financial goals were resetting for fiscal 2018. We're projecting the total ARR growth will increase to between 24% and 26%. Subscription additions are projected to increase by 600,000 to 650,000, which equates to about a 20% increase. Bear in mind, that the sales team focus that goes into the maintenance to subscription program Andrew discussed earlier will drive higher lifetime values from those who convert, but will not drive any additional subscription adds. Spending will be about flat and we expect the percentage of recurring revenue to increase to approximately 90% beginning in Q1. As we look at our outlook for Q1, keep in mind that total ARR growth and subscription additions will build over the course of the year. Another item that I mentioned in December is that we are working to further improve the transparency of our revenue reporting. As such starting in the first quarter, we are planning to have three revenue lines, one for subscription, one for maintenance, and one for other revenue. In this format, all new model subscription revenue will be reported in the subscription line and all maintenance revenue will be reported in the maintenance line, any remaining non-recurring revenue will be reported as other revenue. To alleviate the need for the recon table, we've been including in prepared remarks and should significantly improve the link between our financials and our business model transition. In this format, subscription revenue times four will equal new model AAR, maintenance revenue times four will equal maintenance ARR, and you'll be able to better isolate the non-recurring revenues that flow into the other revenue lines. One side effect of this change to call out is that a changes the impact to our ARR calculation to include a couple of small legacy products. We apply this methodology to our fiscal 2017 results, our total ARR would have been about $40 million higher. We have factored this change into our guidance assumptions for fiscal 2018, so that we are comparing apples-to-apples. And we will give you visibility to all of fiscal 2017 with the small tweak. To wrap things up, we've executed well over the past several quarters and we are looking forward to building on the success as we head into fiscal 2018 and the next stage of our transition. I want to thank our employees and partners who have worked so hard to make last year a success. I also want to recognize Carl Bass for his leadership and tireless service to Autodesk over the past 20 plus years, and we look forward to his continued input as the special advisor over the next few months and an ongoing board member. As we undergo the CEO transition, both Andrew and Amar have our full confidence to lead the Company to continued success. Operator, we’d now like to open up the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question for today comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Saket Kalia Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe just first to start with, Andrew, Andrew, you kind of talked about some of the changes that you're making to maintenance pricing and new model to incentive that conversion. Could you quickly recap the promotion that you're specifically running on product subscription if they trade in their perpetual license? And more broadly, how are you thinking about the maintenance subs to new model subs conversion in 2018? Andrew Anagnost Yes, all right. So let me just recap some basic details you’re seeing, you get the understanding. So the way this works is the customer in return for trading in a perpetual license gets a very big discount to move to subscription, essentially what they're doing is they're paying 5% more than they would pay today on their current maintenance, if they were going right now from today. So they get to move over at that price and they get to lock that price in for three years. So if they move early, they get much more advantage then if they wait. Now one of the things that's important about this program and things we're looking at, we want to move is many of these maintenance customers as possible, really we want to move 100%. Churn is the enemy of this program. So the reason we structured at the way we have with these 5% increases in this discount to move is because we want 100% of them to move. And the advantages we're going to get out of this is to look as they move, they're going to be making different kinds of choices. A lot of them are going to have the best possible price to get to collection that they've ever seen. So what we're going to see instead of a customer moving from maintenance, on AutoCAD to subscription on AutoCAD, they're going to move from AutoCAD maintenance to collection subscription, which by the way has a greater uplift on top of the maintenance base and than just what we're doing. In addition some of the customers are going to stay behind on maintenance. This is just going to be their preferred path. They're going to stay there till the second year of the program and maybe not move until the third year of the program. So they're obviously going to see continual price increases to maintain that perpetual license, but it’s important to them, they're going to end up paying more. But the net result of what we're trying to do is over a three-year period move the majority of that base over. I'm not going to give you specifics about how many we expect to move over this year, but we certainly expect people to start considering this program and we expect to see a lot of our larger customers at the top of the pyramid and down at the bottom where they get a lot of engagement from partners moving quickly. Saket Kalia Great. That's really helpful. And then maybe for my follow-up, actually for you again, Andrew, I just want to confirm, I think you mentioned that new model ARPS of course was up this quarter but could flux quarter to quarter. I may have missed it but can you just confirm, it sounded like it should be roughly flat from a dollar perspective throughout 2018. Is that correct? Andrew Anagnost So if you remember what I said at Investor Day earlier, it's going to start to trend up in the second half of the year. The increase we saw in Q4 is basically a result of the fact that we didn't have a promo in Q4 and we had one in Q3. So you're not going to see that continue, you are going to see some kind of variability as we head through Q1, Q2 and Q3, but as we move into the second half it's not going to be flat, it's actually going to trend up in the latter half of the year. And that's just going to be a result of the accumulation of new model ARPS that we're going to be seeing especially on the products subside and the mix of more mature markets buying product set. Saket Kalia That's very helpful. Thanks very much. Andrew Anagnost You're welcome. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini Great. Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color. I remember at the Investor Day and I apologize if you touched on this in earlier comments President if you could give us a little bit more color about the mix of the cloud subs versus the new – versus the desktop subscriptions and let us know, one, kind of where are you seeing strength in that and how do you – how are you thinking about splitting that out going forward they terms of disclosure? Amarpreet Hanspal Well, Heather, let me take the first part of that question and then Scott can weigh in on the disclosure parts. We saw strength across the board on all types of subscriptions and clearly product descriptions are very strong and we saw EBA’s as I mentioned in the earlier remarks. We had lots of strength in the EBA. We had a record quarter in the cloud because I think it was three times the number of subscriptions that you assume in any prior quarter, so we are definitely seeing a lot of growth from our new cloud-based offerings, but we have continued strength in product subscriptions across the board and we expect that momentum to be carried into this fiscal year. Scott Herren Yes. And Heather within that the strength comes from BIM 360 largely followed by Fusion and then shotgun .  So it was a very strong quarter, it's good to see the cloud products which will be key to kind of the second wave of the transition that the cloud products begin to take off. In terms of disclosure, I would say at this point well it's – we're seeing good growth, still good growth off a small base and it's having a bigger effect obviously on subs and it is on ARR as that becomes material or we think it's clouding the results and making it too difficult to model that's will consider breaking it out. Heather Bellini Okay. And then just one quick follow-up if you don't mind. In regards to the changes that you sent out to the channel partners today, what's been – have you heard any – I imagine you kind of tested the waters on this of before you did it. What type of feedback did you get from customers or from channel partners about the strategy to basically main thence customers paying that increase in price and the move to subscription, basically trading they your license to move to subscription, what type of feedback did you hear if you ran that by any of your larger customers before you did this in? Andrew Anagnost So Heather we do test a lot of these things. Amar and I just got back from our sales conference and I think the most relevant feedback I can give you is that our partners are very, very positive about this program mostly because they really – they see an opportunity for them to go in and have a conversation with the customer. They also see a big opportunity to get the customers for collections and frankly living in two worlds where they have a maintenance model and subscription model isn't exactly in the partners of the customer's best interest. With regards to the customer reaction, I think it's going to take us a little bit more time to gather that reaction. The net that the customers are going to see in terms of value is going to increase, it's going to take us time to really get that, obviously we didn’t test all of this with our customers before we rolled it out because of the nature of the program. Amarpreet Hanspal Just what I'd add to that is from the customer's perspective I mean we're seeing our largest customers really respond very well to the flexibility of products subscription that suites their way of doing business. And also at the low end we are seeing people really respond well to the sort of the lower cash outlay the subscriptions demand from them. And the channel is really energized and is excited. This is a thing that you know how to do well and that was the feedback that Andrew referred to that we got at OTC. So I think right now it feels like the right set of things that are under way. Heather Bellini Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling Auty Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Andrew, I didn't quite catch if somebody moves some AutoCAD maintenance to collections, what's the actual uplift that we would see? Andrew Anagnost Yes, so they're so let me kind of do a little quick, I'm not going to all the math, but I'll give you a quick example. So if they just moved AutoCAD to AutoCAD, it's essentially a 5% increase from the maintenance as it is today. However, if they move that AutoCAD to a collection, it's going to be several $100 higher than that, all right and it's basically the Delta. So there it’s a significant uplift over what they'd be paying normally much more than 5%, but it's the smallest Delta they'll ever see in terms of getting the collections. So I think what’s you need to focus on is the fact that they'll never have a better way to get the collections in this path and essentially if they wait and they find the collections are important part of the solution in the future, they're going to pay a lot more. So a lot of customers just like back in the suites days when we ran all the suites plays, they're going to opt to take the collection route because the price is so attractive now. But it's still – they're still going to pay more because they moved to collections. It's not going to be just a 5% uplift of their current maintenance it's much more. Sterling Auty That makes sense. And then the follow-up is not that I’m expecting you to quantitatively tell us what's built into the guidance. But can give us a feel for okay how did you go about baking in the impact of this program into the guidance? So if there's a massive everybody says, yes, I really want to go to collections, what is said due to is it in immediate impact to revenue and cash flow, how does it come in and on the flip side if everybody says, yes I get what you're doing, but I'm just not interested and it's might of what you expect what kind of magnitude impact can we see to the way that you've guided? Andrew Anagnost So the most important thing you need to remember is its plus 5% on the maintenance base no matter what happens, all right. So there's a price increase in the maintenance base that happens just as a matter of course. So they're all going – the whole entire maintenance base you are going to see a 5% in price increase. They can choose to roll that 5% price increase into a subscription program at three-year lock if they want to but they're all going to see a 5% increase. To your second question about – the specifics about how many are going to move to collections that that's something we're going to watch over time, I expect most of that will be we’ll see later in the year as people try to decide these things, but everybody is going to see 5%. Scott Herren Yes, Sterling said another way. The price for maintenance after the 5% uplift is exact same price they would pay if they converted to subscriptions incentive. So it's from a modeling standpoint for fiscal 2018 at the same whether they convert or not. Sterling Auty Make sense. Thank you, guys. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer Thank you. From Amar and Andrew could you talk about how you’ve ranged the division of labor between yourselves as come CEO's, so long as the arrangement last, how are you dividing your respected responsibilities for overseeing product sales operations and a like? Amarpreet Hanspal Yes, Jay, we are sharing responsibilities rather than dividing them. So Andrew and I have been the co-architects of the plan that you're seeing unfold right now. And so we continuing to work very closely together on for the technology transition as well as the business model transition that's implied. So he and I have been focusing on is driving you know greater focus and urgency on the execution of the plan and basically making decisions jointly through this period. So I wouldn't – well Andrew continue to do his marketing role and I continue to do my product role. The executive decisions we are making, we're making jointly. Andrew Anagnost And Jay just how we moved into this mode, we started this mode well before the announcement of Carl’s departure. So we got ourselves into a cadence of how we were going to make decisions? How we're going to work together on some of these things and Jay we work together for a long time. So we have a pretty good cadence set up already so there was no disruption as we move from the pre to the post Carl era? Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay. My follow-up is did you say I think it Analyst Day on the last call that you expected the new model subspace to exceed the classic maintenance subspace by the end this fiscal year…? Andrew Anagnost That’s correct. This is the crossover year, Jay. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay. And related to that could you talk about how you’re thinking about the channel comp effects of this program in terms of their activity, how they get comp as they look through this program and what the MDS impacts might be? Amarpreet Hanspal Are you talking about the maintenance subscription program? Jay Vleeschhouwer Correct. Amarpreet Hanspal Okay. So obviously the comp structure is going to change on maintenance a bit as time goes on, otherwise the incentives wouldn't be in the right direction. So a partner is going to make more moving a customer to subscription then they're going to make keeping the customer on maintenance, and obviously it's going to be taking a little bit from one and give it to the other. Jay Vleeschhouwer Very good. Thanks very much. Andrew Anagnost Thanks Jay. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow Hey. Thanks guys and congrats on a great end of the year. I just have two questions here. First, as far as when you look at the subscriptions right now that, the net new subscriptions that you're seeing, where are sort of people most compelled, I guess to move because obviously you have products here in the manufacturing vertical, you have a civil vertical, commercial construction where you seeing just the earliest uptake and I just have one follow-up to that? Amarpreet Hanspal Yes, Philip I would certainly say that AEC has been a place where – we see strength across all our verticals, honestly we started this journey on product subscriptions actually with our M&E business first and as we’ve rolled it out and do other products segment. We've seen strength in demand across all verticals. I would say that our AEC business grows – is continuing to grow at a very healthy rate really driven by the adoption of building information modeling around the world. So that's in building and civil all the sub-verticals in AEC, manufacturing has been extremely strong for us as well. In fact in manufacturing in addition to product subscriptions we've seen a growing uptick of the cloud-based solutions with Fusion both on the design side, on the simulation side as well as in the new sort of additive manufacturing fees. So we're very pleased with our growth across the vertical segments. Philip Winslow Got it. And then just a question for Scott and Andrew here about sort of the path, I guess on maintenance pricing because if you look at the price increases that you talk about 5%, 10%, 20% it does become very compelling to make the move this year and lock that, they call that 5% increase and going forward for three years if you're on subscription. So how do you think about converting the base because obviously the maintenance rates are going up and you'll be paying substantially more just one or two years out. So is there a potential this year where you see even faster subscriber growth because sort of act now or never and obviously these are long duration software applications, in other words, long lifecycle. Could you see a faster move and then as you think about the long-term guidance for more of a hockey stick an actual ARR and revenue. So it potentially faster subs, but a hockey stick later on and cause the ARR and revenue to get to those targets. How you just sort of thinking through that because obviously it was pretty compelling program? Amarpreet Hanspal All right. So first off let me just correct something you said. Remember this program is net neutral on subs adds because they're basically moving from one type of recurring revenue to another type of recurring revenue. So it's not a subs adds accelerators, it's an ARR phenomenon and one thing… Andrew Anagnost Yes. Our maintenance to better subscription. Amarpreet Hanspal It will absolutely have a cumulative effect as we move into FY2019 and FY2020. There's no doubt about it. It definitely builds on itself, the program. Now when you look at who's going to move, the people have the largest installations are going to be the ones that are looking right now to try to consider, hey should I move because it's going to make a material difference in their maintenance renewal moving forward and coming to the next year. Smaller accounts, they'll absorb the 5%. They might even absorb the 10%, but as they start looking out to the 20% they're obviously going to move. So you're going to see a chunk that moves in the first year representing a certain size of customer then you're going to see the next chunk that's going to move in the next year and then the people who are really, really attached to their perpetual license, which we don't think is going to be a lot of people will move later in the program. But you can see there's absolutely a cumulative effect to this and not only a cumulative effect from people moving, but remember the discount to move drops 5% every year as well. So the ones that move in the second year move at a higher loyalty price than the ones that move in the first year and the ones that move in the third year get a higher loyalty price, and then ultimately when these people who are locked in this three-year price drop off, the thee-year lock period, they then bounced up to the loyalty price at the end of the program, which is a little bit more than 15% of what they're paying now. So you can see there's a build up here and that will also provide us some runway into FY2021 and beyond in terms of how the base grows in terms of ARR. Amarpreet Hanspal Yes. And what I’d add is that – I don't know whether you’d characterize this as a hockey stick, it's more of a cumulative effect of ARR as Andrew talked about. This is what gives us a lot of confidence in our FY2020 plan, because we do see programs like M2S and the other things that we're driving really set us up for success in the long run. Philip Winslow Great, guys. Thanks a lot. Andrew Anagnost Thanks, Phil. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Citigroup. Kenneth Wong Hey, guys. So when looking at the maintenance sub decline of about 73,000 this quarter, any sense as to how many of those guys convert it over to a product subscription? Scott Herren Ken, I don't think we can project that. What we'd say is that the 73K number was as expected. This was our largest pool of maintenance customers up for renewal and our renewal rate was exactly where we'd expect them to be. So the number is not unusual or unexpected for us. So we will get better at tracking every single customer that goes from column A to column B, especially as we do the maintenance and subscription program. But I think there was nothing unusual about this 73K number that we saw. Kenneth Wong Got it. And then maybe a follow-up to that, as we try to kind of put this in the context of your seasonal Q4 and then the loyalty program you guys are putting in place. Should we see that that number grow and again not grow in a bad way, but obviously that could convert over, but is that 73 number a pretty good pace or too high to low? Scott Herren Yes. Ken, if you look at the seasonality of where we typically sold licenses, which is when the maintenance agreements will expire, right. Kenneth Wong Yes. Scott Herren It’s an annual maintenance agreement when you sold the license becomes the same quarter that maintenance comes through. The two biggest quarters for that are Q4 and Q1. So 73,000 in Q4 as Amar said was really – churn rate was right in line with our expectations, it is a big quarter in Q1 of renewal opportunities. In Q4, there's another big opportunity for renewals in Q1 as well. So obviously we're not guiding to that level of granularity, but it's not on line with what I would expect to see just based on the size of the renewal opportunity. Kenneth Wong Got it. And then they maybe last thing on those kind of the same point, but I might have missed when the program officially kicks in and then I guess what I guess we expect some sort of pull forward during that particular quarter? Andrew Anagnost Yes. The program starts in June and it's tied to their renewal, so there's no kind of pull forward effect here, it's all tied to the renewal event. So as people come up for renewal in a quarter, they get to choose, which path they go on. So it’s June and it's all tied to the renewal event. Kenneth Wong Got it. Okay, thanks to lot guys. Andrew Anagnost Thanks Ken. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Kash Rangan From one K to another K, thank you so much. If you can just give us a little bit of – I certainly appreciate the detail on the pricing uplift et cetera, but what is the incentive for the customer to do the 5% price increase for the maintenance. How is the Company going to explain to the customer? What is the value they’re going to get into turn for the 5% price increase? And also if you could just take a step back I think from the Analyst Day and from this conversation, what is the value to the customer, not from a financial standpoint, disincentive or an incentive, but how does the product fundamentally do different things in the cloud-based versions are the subscription, broadly speaking the subscription arrangement relative to what they were getting from the desktop software that currently – there was not been a lot of discussion, but would love to get enlightened there? Thank you. Andrew Anagnost So first of, Kash a 5% increase on anything is just that's kind of normal course of business in some respects. So the maintenance customers in terms of seeing a 5% price increase that's not going to change things very significantly in their view. And from our view, it's complicated for them, it's complicated for our partners, and it's complicated for the whole infrastructure to maintain these two models. So basically sending out a signal that if you want to maintain a perpetual license it's going to cost you more, it’s a positive signal for the whole ecosystem. And Amar and I will both answer the second question, I just want to put a little bit of a beginning on it. When a customer moves to the subscription model, they're moving to a model that has a lot more access control and insight into how they're using things. And I think that's an important value proposition just without additional products. I mean the access is anytime, anywhere products, they actually get access to different types of versions of products for instance in the AutoCAD world, they get a mobile, web and a desktop experience. They're able to control how they're used, turn them on and off, they get a lot more flexibility. And as we move forward throughout the year, the customers are going to see a lot more value add in the control side and the insight side and how they're using the products that I think is actually real money save for them, so they're going to see real value. Amarpreet Hanspal Yes. So Andrew is absolutely right about the installation and deployment experience that customers get the increase flexibility in terms of where to access things and who gets to access what. The other thing that we're doing is actually also changing the core product value proposition, increasing availability of cloud services on the products subscription side. And in fact there are pieces of our desktop software right now that are being rewritten as cloud services and really it's only those things are available as part of product subscription. So the product is not the same product as we move from the license model to the subscription model. We are actively evolving it to be much more of a hybrid experience and I think customers totally get that and they see that they're going to get access to a stream of innovation as opposed to the annual update that they used to get. Kash Rangan Thanks Amar and Andrew. Good to hear your voice on an earnings conference call. Not to leave you out, Scott, but any thoughts on when you'd be starting to – or if you could give us a little breakdown from this quarter between the EBA, cloud and the desktop subscriptions. Scott Herren Yes. Kash, we're not providing that level of granularity under new model, but as always happens in Q4. Q4 and Q1 are the biggest quarters for enterprise subscription adds, Q4 because we sell the most EBA’s and then they come on line throughout the quarter. Q1 is where we typically get the catch up because as you recall of EBA’s, we actually measure the active users because it’s a consumption model that's not a named user model, we haven't measure the active users and that takes 60 days before we can report those. So I think of enterprises being heavier in Q4 and Q1, products subs are very strong, we mentioned that in the opening commentary that was the leading driver of the growth, 227,000 remodel sub adds during the quarter and cloud was also strong albeit from a smaller base. Kash Rangan Wonderful. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost Thanks, Kash. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss Excellent. Thank you guys. Sorry about being on mute before. Nice quarter. So one question just a clarification. Just so I'm clear. When a customer comes up for renewal they're being faced with a choice either pay 5% more for your renewal or pay 5% more and go onto desktop subscription. And the only reason they wouldn't want to go onto desktop subscription is if they like are afraid that at some point they don't want to pay maintenance anymore and they want to have that perpetual license, is that the correct way to think about it? Amarpreet Hanspal That's really the correct way to think about it and also a lot of the customers – because we took the unusual step of basically announcing what our intended price increase path is for maintenance, a lot of customers that are also going to be making the decision, okay. So how much is that perpetual license worth for me when I get this multi-year lock in price increase? And also we're going to be making it pretty clear to them over time, look at all the additional value you get on the subscription side. So you've got it, you’ve started out right that's how it's going to work at the renewal. Keith Weiss Right. You're not losing functionality when you go to a desktop subscription. You actually gain functionality. Amarpreet Hanspal You're gaining functionality and more important you're also gaining more control over how you actually use and manage the software. So it's a gain for the customer experience wise and capability wise. Keith Weiss Right. And you lock in the price for three years, but there's no sorts of definition of what happens after three years, not like after three years you're coming off a promotional pricing and you get jacked up to some higher pricing. Andrew Anagnost  Every year there's a different loyalty price for them to move. In year one it's 5% more than their current. In year two it's going to be little over 10% more than their current maintenance. And in year three it's a little over 15% above their current maintenance. So there's a different price for each year. When that three year lock in expires, that customer immediately goes up to the terminal loyalty price of a little over 15%, roughly 16% more than their maintenance price. Then they're kind of subject to ongoing price increases that would you affect what our long-term pricing strategy is. There's no giant leap up to the full subscription price. You can see there's still going up to a higher value level. Keith Weiss Got it. Makes sense. If I can just sneak one last one. You mentioned the uplift in value you see when you bring a customer to an EBA. I think you said three times the subscription rate. Should I think about that, I mean is that three times the monetization level that you were able to get out of these customers previously or is it like maintenance to subscription, so it's not really like full monetization if we think about it from a lifetime value of the customer. Amarpreet Hanspal Well, let's clarify that comment. It's three times the number of users that we see inside enterprise account. It generally leads to a higher level of token consumption, which generally leads to ever increasing values of EBA over time, but the multiplier isn’t exactly three, let’s put it that way. Keith Weiss Okay. Any sense you'd give us of what the increase in monetization you get out of moving a customer over to EBA? Amarpreet Hanspal Keith, we typically see at the – I think Steve gave some stats back in our Investor Day. We typically see an uplift in the 30% range at the point of renewal. Keith Weiss Yes, got it. Amarpreet Hanspal In other words when they go for maintenance and convert over to an EBA. Keith Weiss Got it, excellent. Thank you very much guys. Nice quarter. Andrew Anagnost Welcome. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks Keith. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird. Rob Oliver Hey, guys. Thanks for taking one from the new guy. Have you guys noticed any change to the pace of new customer acquisitions? And then a follow-up for Scott. Andrew may have just answered this in response to Kash Rangan's question talking about additional access control, increased cloud services. Scott, you mentioned the high degree of confidence that 606 rev rec isn't going to impact you guys. Can you talk a little bit more about that, add some color there? Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost Sure. Let me take the new customer acquisition. I mean the place where we've seen growth in new customer acquisition has really been from the cloud products. We've certainly made penetration into construction, into manufacturing. We’ve seen growing momentum on that side of the ability to acquire customers that we didn't have before. I would say that depending on how you think about license compliance, you've got customers that have not paid us before. We're starting to make dent with our new model subscription in that customer base that's why a third of the new model subscriptions were really a new to our Company in the results that we saw in Q4. So we're definitely seeing new logos coming in as a result of both the combination of the could as well as product subscription. Scott Herren Yes. And then to the second part of your question Rob, on 606. I could have probably actually let Amar that as well because he has been into it up to his eyeballs. We are not expecting it to have any impact and I think I mentioned to you last time we met and I've said it a couple of times, the person is now our System Controller, used to run our rev ops team and has been a member of the AICPA task force on 606 for a couple of years. So we've had great insight into where this is headed and kind of how it's going to be interpreted and how the guidelines will be applied and going through what we're going through the business model transition. The last thing we wanted just to get to the end of this and have all that revenue flip back to upfront. So we've been working this for quite some time and I think Andrew just mentioned and Amar did as well. We've built in into our products subscription, a fair amount of integrated cloud functionality such that a significant amount of the value comes not just from the executables that come down to the endpoint, but from the interaction with the cloud services. And so we're quite confident that we're going to have a nominal impact from 606. Rob Oliver Got it, okay. Great, that's helpful. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it. Scott Herren Thanks Rob. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gal Munda from Berenberg. Gal Munda Hi, guys. Just a few questions if I can. The first one is just to understand your pools full of active users, if we can look back retrospectively. At the start of 2016, we had a famous 5.1 million users, which was at the last capital market that it was kind of underestimated, but out of that users we had 2.3 million subs we know that. Now we're up to 3.1 million subs. What is your best guess on the other part of the pool, which initially was 2.8 million, today how big, is it because I’d mention it would be bigger than 2 million, the difference between 3.1 million and 5.1 million, but how do you look at that? Andrew Anagnost Yes. Actually one of our biggest opportunities as we move over the next couple years is converting users into subscribers, right. I mean that pretty basically they're using it, but they're not paying us. And if you remember from Investor Day, they come in two pools and actually we have fairly high fidelity in terms of information on how many of these people are active. So if you look at this non-subscribers base meaning people who bought a perpetual copy of software from us and then dropped off. The active level there is about a 2.2 million. So there's about 2.2 million active people using our software that aren't paying us, but have paid us in the past. The more interesting number is the 6 million plus pirates who are actively using our software and by the way we know that they're using the software because we're able to track the pirated serial numbers and the pirate activity. That's a more interesting number for us long-term and it's interesting to note that about 4 million of those pirates are in mature markets and about 1.2 million of them are in accounts that we know and have worked with in the past. So there is a very large base of users out there that are not subscribers. We're not going to be moving all of those over to us at once, but one of the things that’s really important, especially when it comes to the subscriber growth we're going to see this year is the momentum, we're going to be building into FY2017, because all of these programs that are targeted at the non-subscribers for instance are going to start seeing rapid acceleration as we head into the second half of the year, which is going to carry into FY2017. The products that Amar talked about earlier are actually going to have some pretty significant pool for these non-subscribers to move forward. That will not only be good for this year, it's going to be very good for FY2017. And the next thing we're doing this year is we're mainstreaming all of our piracy efforts, the efforts that are targeting these non-users and as we move into the end of this year and into FY2017, we will actually have in product purchasing capability for a pirate. So the pirate will actually get a notification and say hey, you might want to pay for the software. So this base is going to move over several years, but as you can see it's pretty big. Gal Munda Okay. So at least 2.2 active non-subscribers now plus at least… Andrew Anagnost 2.2 active non-subscribers plus another 6 million plus pirates. Gal Munda Okay. That makes sense. Andrew Anagnost That’s figured in our current paying base. Gal Munda Of course. Just as a follow-up, on the guidance you kind of expecting north of 600,000 monthly users over the next year is indicating some sort of acceleration especially considering historically when you guys talked about the volume of licenses as you would be saying between 600,000 and 700,000 would be the total volume licenses that you see in any given year. Now taking some sort of churn that we're seeing at the moment into that that would indicate that you're on the volume expecting more or something like 900,000 just very high level calculation. Does that indicate that you have – how does it compare to FY2017 you just finished and also does it indicate that there's some acceleration of the new users acquisition maybe some of the activation of that old pool? Scott Herren Yes. So good question, I mean look I think our unit volume for this year was right where we expected it to be and I think our growing momentum based on the factors that Andrew touched upon, we are certainly seeing increasing momentum through license compliance to what we would have called a legacy customer base. And one of the places where we are definitely accelerating acquisition of customers is also the cloud and as regions around the world whether they are emerging countries or places in Asia they come back to better economic health, they will contribute to this sort of overall unit volume growth. That's why we're very confident that the momentum we're carrying into this year combined with license compliance legacy as well as momentum in cloud as well as the changes that we talked about in the product that really drive customers to be more current. They're all factors that we believe will drive that result that we pointed to. Gal Munda Okay. Andrew Anagnost Yes, Gal, one of the things that of course was not in that historic range of – actually we said 500,000, 800,000, but the midpoints the same with year 600,000 to 700,000. What's not in air forces cloud and so as we've seen the cloud begin to accelerated and it's not in our the unit volume that we referred to from time-to-time either. So take that as what's happening in the core business, later on the increase we're seeing as Amar just pointed out in both legacy recapture and the sort of our piracy programs and then put cloud on top of that. That's how you get the total gross. Gal Munda Okay and the total growth that you're expecting – is it around 900,000 is fair to say? Amarpreet Hanspal So we're not guiding at that level. We're not providing that type of inside, but we feel confident in the 600,000 to 650,000 net sub ads for the year. Gal Munda Okay. Thank you so much. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks Gal. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Monika Garg Thanks for taking my question. First, given that in Q4 soul in the perpetual license, it was mainly subscription why would revenue guidance for Q1 is flattish to more its lower? Andrew Anagnost Yes, Monika the one think when you look year-on-year and you got the data now for the full-year of fiscal 2017. The non-recurring element of course included six months of suite perpetual license sales. There won't be any suite perpetual license sales of course, but that means as the total non-recurring revenue year-on-year is coming down pretty significantly. So we gave you a couple of data points earlier. So we guided revenue into a range of 2 billion to 2.05 billion and said in the opening commentary that we expect that about 90% to be recurring, right. So if you do the quick math you can say the non-recurring fees is going to be ballpark $200 million. If you look at what that was last year that was closer to $500 billion. And so I think where the differences in the year-on-year, it's certainly we're seeing great growth on the recurring side, you see that in our ARR guidance, but the non-recurring element of course is coming down year-on-year. Monika Garg Right. I was actually looking Q-over-Q right, from 4Q to 1Q? Andrew Anagnost Yes, so you can see the same thing from Q4 to Q1. Monika Garg Okay. Andrew Anagnost Right, you will see the non-recurring elements coming down pretty significantly. Monika Garg Got it. And then coming back to the maintenance pricing increase of the loyalty program you talked about. What is the risk of losing customers to competition due to this maintenance pricing increase you have talked about with your channel over the next year? Thank you. Scott Herren Yes, so one of the reasons we structured the program the way we did is we were really focused on minimizing the churn off of that maintenance base. So we feel that the way we structured the program, the huge incentives for loyalty that we're giving the maintenance customers is really a churn minimization plan. So we're feeling pretty confident. Our competitors have historically tried to make incursions into our installed base as we move to subscription, but the truth of the matter is none of them have been particularly successful and it's really hard to compete with software that that prices and accessibility levels that are far below what they've been historically when you come in with more expensive perpetual software. So yes competitors try to make encourage their incursions. They haven't been successful and I think we structured this program as a churn minimization program with a primary goal. Monika Garg Got it. Thank you so much. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks, Monika. End of Q&A Operator Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn things over to David Gennarelli for any closing comments. David Gennarelli Thanks, Karen. That concludes our conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] And our first question for today comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Saket Kalia Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe just first to start with, Andrew, Andrew, you kind of talked about some of the changes that you're making to maintenance pricing and new model to incentive that conversion. Could you quickly recap the promotion that you're specifically running on product subscription if they trade in their perpetual license? And more broadly, how are you thinking about the maintenance subs to new model subs conversion in 2018? Andrew Anagnost Yes, all right. So let me just recap some basic details you’re seeing, you get the understanding. So the way this works is the customer in return for trading in a perpetual license gets a very big discount to move to subscription, essentially what they're doing is they're paying 5% more than they would pay today on their current maintenance, if they were going right now from today. So they get to move over at that price and they get to lock that price in for three years. So if they move early, they get much more advantage then if they wait. Now one of the things that's important about this program and things we're looking at, we want to move is many of these maintenance customers as possible, really we want to move 100%. Churn is the enemy of this program. So the reason we structured at the way we have with these 5% increases in this discount to move is because we want 100% of them to move. And the advantages we're going to get out of this is to look as they move, they're going to be making different kinds of choices. A lot of them are going to have the best possible price to get to collection that they've ever seen. So what we're going to see instead of a customer moving from maintenance, on AutoCAD to subscription on AutoCAD, they're going to move from AutoCAD maintenance to collection subscription, which by the way has a greater uplift on top of the maintenance base and than just what we're doing. In addition some of the customers are going to stay behind on maintenance. This is just going to be their preferred path. They're going to stay there till the second year of the program and maybe not move until the third year of the program. So they're obviously going to see continual price increases to maintain that perpetual license, but it’s important to them, they're going to end up paying more. But the net result of what we're trying to do is over a three-year period move the majority of that base over. I'm not going to give you specifics about how many we expect to move over this year, but we certainly expect people to start considering this program and we expect to see a lot of our larger customers at the top of the pyramid and down at the bottom where they get a lot of engagement from partners moving quickly. Saket Kalia Great. That's really helpful. And then maybe for my follow-up, actually for you again, Andrew, I just want to confirm, I think you mentioned that new model ARPS of course was up this quarter but could flux quarter to quarter. I may have missed it but can you just confirm, it sounded like it should be roughly flat from a dollar perspective throughout 2018. Is that correct? Andrew Anagnost So if you remember what I said at Investor Day earlier, it's going to start to trend up in the second half of the year. The increase we saw in Q4 is basically a result of the fact that we didn't have a promo in Q4 and we had one in Q3. So you're not going to see that continue, you are going to see some kind of variability as we head through Q1, Q2 and Q3, but as we move into the second half it's not going to be flat, it's actually going to trend up in the latter half of the year. And that's just going to be a result of the accumulation of new model ARPS that we're going to be seeing especially on the products subside and the mix of more mature markets buying product set. Saket Kalia That's very helpful. Thanks very much. Andrew Anagnost You're welcome. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini Great. Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color. I remember at the Investor Day and I apologize if you touched on this in earlier comments President if you could give us a little bit more color about the mix of the cloud subs versus the new – versus the desktop subscriptions and let us know, one, kind of where are you seeing strength in that and how do you – how are you thinking about splitting that out going forward they terms of disclosure? Amarpreet Hanspal Well, Heather, let me take the first part of that question and then Scott can weigh in on the disclosure parts. We saw strength across the board on all types of subscriptions and clearly product descriptions are very strong and we saw EBA’s as I mentioned in the earlier remarks. We had lots of strength in the EBA. We had a record quarter in the cloud because I think it was three times the number of subscriptions that you assume in any prior quarter, so we are definitely seeing a lot of growth from our new cloud-based offerings, but we have continued strength in product subscriptions across the board and we expect that momentum to be carried into this fiscal year. Scott Herren Yes. And Heather within that the strength comes from BIM 360 largely followed by Fusion and then shotgun .  So it was a very strong quarter, it's good to see the cloud products which will be key to kind of the second wave of the transition that the cloud products begin to take off. In terms of disclosure, I would say at this point well it's – we're seeing good growth, still good growth off a small base and it's having a bigger effect obviously on subs and it is on ARR as that becomes material or we think it's clouding the results and making it too difficult to model that's will consider breaking it out. Heather Bellini Okay. And then just one quick follow-up if you don't mind. In regards to the changes that you sent out to the channel partners today, what's been – have you heard any – I imagine you kind of tested the waters on this of before you did it. What type of feedback did you get from customers or from channel partners about the strategy to basically main thence customers paying that increase in price and the move to subscription, basically trading they your license to move to subscription, what type of feedback did you hear if you ran that by any of your larger customers before you did this in? Andrew Anagnost So Heather we do test a lot of these things. Amar and I just got back from our sales conference and I think the most relevant feedback I can give you is that our partners are very, very positive about this program mostly because they really – they see an opportunity for them to go in and have a conversation with the customer. They also see a big opportunity to get the customers for collections and frankly living in two worlds where they have a maintenance model and subscription model isn't exactly in the partners of the customer's best interest. With regards to the customer reaction, I think it's going to take us a little bit more time to gather that reaction. The net that the customers are going to see in terms of value is going to increase, it's going to take us time to really get that, obviously we didn’t test all of this with our customers before we rolled it out because of the nature of the program. Amarpreet Hanspal Just what I'd add to that is from the customer's perspective I mean we're seeing our largest customers really respond very well to the flexibility of products subscription that suites their way of doing business. And also at the low end we are seeing people really respond well to the sort of the lower cash outlay the subscriptions demand from them. And the channel is really energized and is excited. This is a thing that you know how to do well and that was the feedback that Andrew referred to that we got at OTC. So I think right now it feels like the right set of things that are under way. Heather Bellini Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling Auty Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Andrew, I didn't quite catch if somebody moves some AutoCAD maintenance to collections, what's the actual uplift that we would see? Andrew Anagnost Yes, so they're so let me kind of do a little quick, I'm not going to all the math, but I'll give you a quick example. So if they just moved AutoCAD to AutoCAD, it's essentially a 5% increase from the maintenance as it is today. However, if they move that AutoCAD to a collection, it's going to be several $100 higher than that, all right and it's basically the Delta. So there it’s a significant uplift over what they'd be paying normally much more than 5%, but it's the smallest Delta they'll ever see in terms of getting the collections. So I think what’s you need to focus on is the fact that they'll never have a better way to get the collections in this path and essentially if they wait and they find the collections are important part of the solution in the future, they're going to pay a lot more. So a lot of customers just like back in the suites days when we ran all the suites plays, they're going to opt to take the collection route because the price is so attractive now. But it's still – they're still going to pay more because they moved to collections. It's not going to be just a 5% uplift of their current maintenance it's much more. Sterling Auty That makes sense. And then the follow-up is not that I’m expecting you to quantitatively tell us what's built into the guidance. But can give us a feel for okay how did you go about baking in the impact of this program into the guidance? So if there's a massive everybody says, yes, I really want to go to collections, what is said due to is it in immediate impact to revenue and cash flow, how does it come in and on the flip side if everybody says, yes I get what you're doing, but I'm just not interested and it's might of what you expect what kind of magnitude impact can we see to the way that you've guided? Andrew Anagnost So the most important thing you need to remember is its plus 5% on the maintenance base no matter what happens, all right. So there's a price increase in the maintenance base that happens just as a matter of course. So they're all going – the whole entire maintenance base you are going to see a 5% in price increase. They can choose to roll that 5% price increase into a subscription program at three-year lock if they want to but they're all going to see a 5% increase. To your second question about – the specifics about how many are going to move to collections that that's something we're going to watch over time, I expect most of that will be we’ll see later in the year as people try to decide these things, but everybody is going to see 5%. Scott Herren Yes, Sterling said another way. The price for maintenance after the 5% uplift is exact same price they would pay if they converted to subscriptions incentive. So it's from a modeling standpoint for fiscal 2018 at the same whether they convert or not. Sterling Auty Make sense. Thank you, guys. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer Thank you. From Amar and Andrew could you talk about how you’ve ranged the division of labor between yourselves as come CEO's, so long as the arrangement last, how are you dividing your respected responsibilities for overseeing product sales operations and a like? Amarpreet Hanspal Yes, Jay, we are sharing responsibilities rather than dividing them. So Andrew and I have been the co-architects of the plan that you're seeing unfold right now. And so we continuing to work very closely together on for the technology transition as well as the business model transition that's implied. So he and I have been focusing on is driving you know greater focus and urgency on the execution of the plan and basically making decisions jointly through this period. So I wouldn't – well Andrew continue to do his marketing role and I continue to do my product role. The executive decisions we are making, we're making jointly. Andrew Anagnost And Jay just how we moved into this mode, we started this mode well before the announcement of Carl’s departure. So we got ourselves into a cadence of how we were going to make decisions? How we're going to work together on some of these things and Jay we work together for a long time. So we have a pretty good cadence set up already so there was no disruption as we move from the pre to the post Carl era? Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay. My follow-up is did you say I think it Analyst Day on the last call that you expected the new model subspace to exceed the classic maintenance subspace by the end this fiscal year…? Andrew Anagnost That’s correct. This is the crossover year, Jay. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay. And related to that could you talk about how you’re thinking about the channel comp effects of this program in terms of their activity, how they get comp as they look through this program and what the MDS impacts might be? Amarpreet Hanspal Are you talking about the maintenance subscription program? Jay Vleeschhouwer Correct. Amarpreet Hanspal Okay. So obviously the comp structure is going to change on maintenance a bit as time goes on, otherwise the incentives wouldn't be in the right direction. So a partner is going to make more moving a customer to subscription then they're going to make keeping the customer on maintenance, and obviously it's going to be taking a little bit from one and give it to the other. Jay Vleeschhouwer Very good. Thanks very much. Andrew Anagnost Thanks Jay. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow Hey. Thanks guys and congrats on a great end of the year. I just have two questions here. First, as far as when you look at the subscriptions right now that, the net new subscriptions that you're seeing, where are sort of people most compelled, I guess to move because obviously you have products here in the manufacturing vertical, you have a civil vertical, commercial construction where you seeing just the earliest uptake and I just have one follow-up to that? Amarpreet Hanspal Yes, Philip I would certainly say that AEC has been a place where – we see strength across all our verticals, honestly we started this journey on product subscriptions actually with our M&E business first and as we’ve rolled it out and do other products segment. We've seen strength in demand across all verticals. I would say that our AEC business grows – is continuing to grow at a very healthy rate really driven by the adoption of building information modeling around the world. So that's in building and civil all the sub-verticals in AEC, manufacturing has been extremely strong for us as well. In fact in manufacturing in addition to product subscriptions we've seen a growing uptick of the cloud-based solutions with Fusion both on the design side, on the simulation side as well as in the new sort of additive manufacturing fees. So we're very pleased with our growth across the vertical segments. Philip Winslow Got it. And then just a question for Scott and Andrew here about sort of the path, I guess on maintenance pricing because if you look at the price increases that you talk about 5%, 10%, 20% it does become very compelling to make the move this year and lock that, they call that 5% increase and going forward for three years if you're on subscription. So how do you think about converting the base because obviously the maintenance rates are going up and you'll be paying substantially more just one or two years out. So is there a potential this year where you see even faster subscriber growth because sort of act now or never and obviously these are long duration software applications, in other words, long lifecycle. Could you see a faster move and then as you think about the long-term guidance for more of a hockey stick an actual ARR and revenue. So it potentially faster subs, but a hockey stick later on and cause the ARR and revenue to get to those targets. How you just sort of thinking through that because obviously it was pretty compelling program? Amarpreet Hanspal All right. So first off let me just correct something you said. Remember this program is net neutral on subs adds because they're basically moving from one type of recurring revenue to another type of recurring revenue. So it's not a subs adds accelerators, it's an ARR phenomenon and one thing… Andrew Anagnost Yes. Our maintenance to better subscription. Amarpreet Hanspal It will absolutely have a cumulative effect as we move into FY2019 and FY2020. There's no doubt about it. It definitely builds on itself, the program. Now when you look at who's going to move, the people have the largest installations are going to be the ones that are looking right now to try to consider, hey should I move because it's going to make a material difference in their maintenance renewal moving forward and coming to the next year. Smaller accounts, they'll absorb the 5%. They might even absorb the 10%, but as they start looking out to the 20% they're obviously going to move. So you're going to see a chunk that moves in the first year representing a certain size of customer then you're going to see the next chunk that's going to move in the next year and then the people who are really, really attached to their perpetual license, which we don't think is going to be a lot of people will move later in the program. But you can see there's absolutely a cumulative effect to this and not only a cumulative effect from people moving, but remember the discount to move drops 5% every year as well. So the ones that move in the second year move at a higher loyalty price than the ones that move in the first year and the ones that move in the third year get a higher loyalty price, and then ultimately when these people who are locked in this three-year price drop off, the thee-year lock period, they then bounced up to the loyalty price at the end of the program, which is a little bit more than 15% of what they're paying now. So you can see there's a build up here and that will also provide us some runway into FY2021 and beyond in terms of how the base grows in terms of ARR. Amarpreet Hanspal Yes. And what I’d add is that – I don't know whether you’d characterize this as a hockey stick, it's more of a cumulative effect of ARR as Andrew talked about. This is what gives us a lot of confidence in our FY2020 plan, because we do see programs like M2S and the other things that we're driving really set us up for success in the long run. Philip Winslow Great, guys. Thanks a lot. Andrew Anagnost Thanks, Phil. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Citigroup. Kenneth Wong Hey, guys. So when looking at the maintenance sub decline of about 73,000 this quarter, any sense as to how many of those guys convert it over to a product subscription? Scott Herren Ken, I don't think we can project that. What we'd say is that the 73K number was as expected. This was our largest pool of maintenance customers up for renewal and our renewal rate was exactly where we'd expect them to be. So the number is not unusual or unexpected for us. So we will get better at tracking every single customer that goes from column A to column B, especially as we do the maintenance and subscription program. But I think there was nothing unusual about this 73K number that we saw. Kenneth Wong Got it. And then maybe a follow-up to that, as we try to kind of put this in the context of your seasonal Q4 and then the loyalty program you guys are putting in place. Should we see that that number grow and again not grow in a bad way, but obviously that could convert over, but is that 73 number a pretty good pace or too high to low? Scott Herren Yes. Ken, if you look at the seasonality of where we typically sold licenses, which is when the maintenance agreements will expire, right. Kenneth Wong Yes. Scott Herren It’s an annual maintenance agreement when you sold the license becomes the same quarter that maintenance comes through. The two biggest quarters for that are Q4 and Q1. So 73,000 in Q4 as Amar said was really – churn rate was right in line with our expectations, it is a big quarter in Q1 of renewal opportunities. In Q4, there's another big opportunity for renewals in Q1 as well. So obviously we're not guiding to that level of granularity, but it's not on line with what I would expect to see just based on the size of the renewal opportunity. Kenneth Wong Got it. And then they maybe last thing on those kind of the same point, but I might have missed when the program officially kicks in and then I guess what I guess we expect some sort of pull forward during that particular quarter? Andrew Anagnost Yes. The program starts in June and it's tied to their renewal, so there's no kind of pull forward effect here, it's all tied to the renewal event. So as people come up for renewal in a quarter, they get to choose, which path they go on. So it’s June and it's all tied to the renewal event. Kenneth Wong Got it. Okay, thanks to lot guys. Andrew Anagnost Thanks Ken. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Kash Rangan From one K to another K, thank you so much. If you can just give us a little bit of – I certainly appreciate the detail on the pricing uplift et cetera, but what is the incentive for the customer to do the 5% price increase for the maintenance. How is the Company going to explain to the customer? What is the value they’re going to get into turn for the 5% price increase? And also if you could just take a step back I think from the Analyst Day and from this conversation, what is the value to the customer, not from a financial standpoint, disincentive or an incentive, but how does the product fundamentally do different things in the cloud-based versions are the subscription, broadly speaking the subscription arrangement relative to what they were getting from the desktop software that currently – there was not been a lot of discussion, but would love to get enlightened there? Thank you. Andrew Anagnost So first of, Kash a 5% increase on anything is just that's kind of normal course of business in some respects. So the maintenance customers in terms of seeing a 5% price increase that's not going to change things very significantly in their view. And from our view, it's complicated for them, it's complicated for our partners, and it's complicated for the whole infrastructure to maintain these two models. So basically sending out a signal that if you want to maintain a perpetual license it's going to cost you more, it’s a positive signal for the whole ecosystem. And Amar and I will both answer the second question, I just want to put a little bit of a beginning on it. When a customer moves to the subscription model, they're moving to a model that has a lot more access control and insight into how they're using things. And I think that's an important value proposition just without additional products. I mean the access is anytime, anywhere products, they actually get access to different types of versions of products for instance in the AutoCAD world, they get a mobile, web and a desktop experience. They're able to control how they're used, turn them on and off, they get a lot more flexibility. And as we move forward throughout the year, the customers are going to see a lot more value add in the control side and the insight side and how they're using the products that I think is actually real money save for them, so they're going to see real value. Amarpreet Hanspal Yes. So Andrew is absolutely right about the installation and deployment experience that customers get the increase flexibility in terms of where to access things and who gets to access what. The other thing that we're doing is actually also changing the core product value proposition, increasing availability of cloud services on the products subscription side. And in fact there are pieces of our desktop software right now that are being rewritten as cloud services and really it's only those things are available as part of product subscription. So the product is not the same product as we move from the license model to the subscription model. We are actively evolving it to be much more of a hybrid experience and I think customers totally get that and they see that they're going to get access to a stream of innovation as opposed to the annual update that they used to get. Kash Rangan Thanks Amar and Andrew. Good to hear your voice on an earnings conference call. Not to leave you out, Scott, but any thoughts on when you'd be starting to – or if you could give us a little breakdown from this quarter between the EBA, cloud and the desktop subscriptions. Scott Herren Yes. Kash, we're not providing that level of granularity under new model, but as always happens in Q4. Q4 and Q1 are the biggest quarters for enterprise subscription adds, Q4 because we sell the most EBA’s and then they come on line throughout the quarter. Q1 is where we typically get the catch up because as you recall of EBA’s, we actually measure the active users because it’s a consumption model that's not a named user model, we haven't measure the active users and that takes 60 days before we can report those. So I think of enterprises being heavier in Q4 and Q1, products subs are very strong, we mentioned that in the opening commentary that was the leading driver of the growth, 227,000 remodel sub adds during the quarter and cloud was also strong albeit from a smaller base. Kash Rangan Wonderful. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost Thanks, Kash. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss Excellent. Thank you guys. Sorry about being on mute before. Nice quarter. So one question just a clarification. Just so I'm clear. When a customer comes up for renewal they're being faced with a choice either pay 5% more for your renewal or pay 5% more and go onto desktop subscription. And the only reason they wouldn't want to go onto desktop subscription is if they like are afraid that at some point they don't want to pay maintenance anymore and they want to have that perpetual license, is that the correct way to think about it? Amarpreet Hanspal That's really the correct way to think about it and also a lot of the customers – because we took the unusual step of basically announcing what our intended price increase path is for maintenance, a lot of customers that are also going to be making the decision, okay. So how much is that perpetual license worth for me when I get this multi-year lock in price increase? And also we're going to be making it pretty clear to them over time, look at all the additional value you get on the subscription side. So you've got it, you’ve started out right that's how it's going to work at the renewal. Keith Weiss Right. You're not losing functionality when you go to a desktop subscription. You actually gain functionality. Amarpreet Hanspal You're gaining functionality and more important you're also gaining more control over how you actually use and manage the software. So it's a gain for the customer experience wise and capability wise. Keith Weiss Right. And you lock in the price for three years, but there's no sorts of definition of what happens after three years, not like after three years you're coming off a promotional pricing and you get jacked up to some higher pricing. Andrew Anagnost  Every year there's a different loyalty price for them to move. In year one it's 5% more than their current. In year two it's going to be little over 10% more than their current maintenance. And in year three it's a little over 15% above their current maintenance. So there's a different price for each year. When that three year lock in expires, that customer immediately goes up to the terminal loyalty price of a little over 15%, roughly 16% more than their maintenance price. Then they're kind of subject to ongoing price increases that would you affect what our long-term pricing strategy is. There's no giant leap up to the full subscription price. You can see there's still going up to a higher value level. Keith Weiss Got it. Makes sense. If I can just sneak one last one. You mentioned the uplift in value you see when you bring a customer to an EBA. I think you said three times the subscription rate. Should I think about that, I mean is that three times the monetization level that you were able to get out of these customers previously or is it like maintenance to subscription, so it's not really like full monetization if we think about it from a lifetime value of the customer. Amarpreet Hanspal Well, let's clarify that comment. It's three times the number of users that we see inside enterprise account. It generally leads to a higher level of token consumption, which generally leads to ever increasing values of EBA over time, but the multiplier isn’t exactly three, let’s put it that way. Keith Weiss Okay. Any sense you'd give us of what the increase in monetization you get out of moving a customer over to EBA? Amarpreet Hanspal Keith, we typically see at the – I think Steve gave some stats back in our Investor Day. We typically see an uplift in the 30% range at the point of renewal. Keith Weiss Yes, got it. Amarpreet Hanspal In other words when they go for maintenance and convert over to an EBA. Keith Weiss Got it, excellent. Thank you very much guys. Nice quarter. Andrew Anagnost Welcome. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks Keith. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird. Rob Oliver Hey, guys. Thanks for taking one from the new guy. Have you guys noticed any change to the pace of new customer acquisitions? And then a follow-up for Scott. Andrew may have just answered this in response to Kash Rangan's question talking about additional access control, increased cloud services. Scott, you mentioned the high degree of confidence that 606 rev rec isn't going to impact you guys. Can you talk a little bit more about that, add some color there? Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost Sure. Let me take the new customer acquisition. I mean the place where we've seen growth in new customer acquisition has really been from the cloud products. We've certainly made penetration into construction, into manufacturing. We’ve seen growing momentum on that side of the ability to acquire customers that we didn't have before. I would say that depending on how you think about license compliance, you've got customers that have not paid us before. We're starting to make dent with our new model subscription in that customer base that's why a third of the new model subscriptions were really a new to our Company in the results that we saw in Q4. So we're definitely seeing new logos coming in as a result of both the combination of the could as well as product subscription. Scott Herren Yes. And then to the second part of your question Rob, on 606. I could have probably actually let Amar that as well because he has been into it up to his eyeballs. We are not expecting it to have any impact and I think I mentioned to you last time we met and I've said it a couple of times, the person is now our System Controller, used to run our rev ops team and has been a member of the AICPA task force on 606 for a couple of years. So we've had great insight into where this is headed and kind of how it's going to be interpreted and how the guidelines will be applied and going through what we're going through the business model transition. The last thing we wanted just to get to the end of this and have all that revenue flip back to upfront. So we've been working this for quite some time and I think Andrew just mentioned and Amar did as well. We've built in into our products subscription, a fair amount of integrated cloud functionality such that a significant amount of the value comes not just from the executables that come down to the endpoint, but from the interaction with the cloud services. And so we're quite confident that we're going to have a nominal impact from 606. Rob Oliver Got it, okay. Great, that's helpful. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it. Scott Herren Thanks Rob. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gal Munda from Berenberg. Gal Munda Hi, guys. Just a few questions if I can. The first one is just to understand your pools full of active users, if we can look back retrospectively. At the start of 2016, we had a famous 5.1 million users, which was at the last capital market that it was kind of underestimated, but out of that users we had 2.3 million subs we know that. Now we're up to 3.1 million subs. What is your best guess on the other part of the pool, which initially was 2.8 million, today how big, is it because I’d mention it would be bigger than 2 million, the difference between 3.1 million and 5.1 million, but how do you look at that? Andrew Anagnost Yes. Actually one of our biggest opportunities as we move over the next couple years is converting users into subscribers, right. I mean that pretty basically they're using it, but they're not paying us. And if you remember from Investor Day, they come in two pools and actually we have fairly high fidelity in terms of information on how many of these people are active. So if you look at this non-subscribers base meaning people who bought a perpetual copy of software from us and then dropped off. The active level there is about a 2.2 million. So there's about 2.2 million active people using our software that aren't paying us, but have paid us in the past. The more interesting number is the 6 million plus pirates who are actively using our software and by the way we know that they're using the software because we're able to track the pirated serial numbers and the pirate activity. That's a more interesting number for us long-term and it's interesting to note that about 4 million of those pirates are in mature markets and about 1.2 million of them are in accounts that we know and have worked with in the past. So there is a very large base of users out there that are not subscribers. We're not going to be moving all of those over to us at once, but one of the things that’s really important, especially when it comes to the subscriber growth we're going to see this year is the momentum, we're going to be building into FY2017, because all of these programs that are targeted at the non-subscribers for instance are going to start seeing rapid acceleration as we head into the second half of the year, which is going to carry into FY2017. The products that Amar talked about earlier are actually going to have some pretty significant pool for these non-subscribers to move forward. That will not only be good for this year, it's going to be very good for FY2017. And the next thing we're doing this year is we're mainstreaming all of our piracy efforts, the efforts that are targeting these non-users and as we move into the end of this year and into FY2017, we will actually have in product purchasing capability for a pirate. So the pirate will actually get a notification and say hey, you might want to pay for the software. So this base is going to move over several years, but as you can see it's pretty big. Gal Munda Okay. So at least 2.2 active non-subscribers now plus at least… Andrew Anagnost 2.2 active non-subscribers plus another 6 million plus pirates. Gal Munda Okay. That makes sense. Andrew Anagnost That’s figured in our current paying base. Gal Munda Of course. Just as a follow-up, on the guidance you kind of expecting north of 600,000 monthly users over the next year is indicating some sort of acceleration especially considering historically when you guys talked about the volume of licenses as you would be saying between 600,000 and 700,000 would be the total volume licenses that you see in any given year. Now taking some sort of churn that we're seeing at the moment into that that would indicate that you're on the volume expecting more or something like 900,000 just very high level calculation. Does that indicate that you have – how does it compare to FY2017 you just finished and also does it indicate that there's some acceleration of the new users acquisition maybe some of the activation of that old pool? Scott Herren Yes. So good question, I mean look I think our unit volume for this year was right where we expected it to be and I think our growing momentum based on the factors that Andrew touched upon, we are certainly seeing increasing momentum through license compliance to what we would have called a legacy customer base. And one of the places where we are definitely accelerating acquisition of customers is also the cloud and as regions around the world whether they are emerging countries or places in Asia they come back to better economic health, they will contribute to this sort of overall unit volume growth. That's why we're very confident that the momentum we're carrying into this year combined with license compliance legacy as well as momentum in cloud as well as the changes that we talked about in the product that really drive customers to be more current. They're all factors that we believe will drive that result that we pointed to. Gal Munda Okay. Andrew Anagnost Yes, Gal, one of the things that of course was not in that historic range of – actually we said 500,000, 800,000, but the midpoints the same with year 600,000 to 700,000. What's not in air forces cloud and so as we've seen the cloud begin to accelerated and it's not in our the unit volume that we referred to from time-to-time either. So take that as what's happening in the core business, later on the increase we're seeing as Amar just pointed out in both legacy recapture and the sort of our piracy programs and then put cloud on top of that. That's how you get the total gross. Gal Munda Okay and the total growth that you're expecting – is it around 900,000 is fair to say? Amarpreet Hanspal So we're not guiding at that level. We're not providing that type of inside, but we feel confident in the 600,000 to 650,000 net sub ads for the year. Gal Munda Okay. Thank you so much. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks Gal. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Monika Garg Thanks for taking my question. First, given that in Q4 soul in the perpetual license, it was mainly subscription why would revenue guidance for Q1 is flattish to more its lower? Andrew Anagnost Yes, Monika the one think when you look year-on-year and you got the data now for the full-year of fiscal 2017. The non-recurring element of course included six months of suite perpetual license sales. There won't be any suite perpetual license sales of course, but that means as the total non-recurring revenue year-on-year is coming down pretty significantly. So we gave you a couple of data points earlier. So we guided revenue into a range of 2 billion to 2.05 billion and said in the opening commentary that we expect that about 90% to be recurring, right. So if you do the quick math you can say the non-recurring fees is going to be ballpark $200 million. If you look at what that was last year that was closer to $500 billion. And so I think where the differences in the year-on-year, it's certainly we're seeing great growth on the recurring side, you see that in our ARR guidance, but the non-recurring element of course is coming down year-on-year. Monika Garg Right. I was actually looking Q-over-Q right, from 4Q to 1Q? Andrew Anagnost Yes, so you can see the same thing from Q4 to Q1. Monika Garg Okay. Andrew Anagnost Right, you will see the non-recurring elements coming down pretty significantly. Monika Garg Got it. And then coming back to the maintenance pricing increase of the loyalty program you talked about. What is the risk of losing customers to competition due to this maintenance pricing increase you have talked about with your channel over the next year? Thank you. Scott Herren Yes, so one of the reasons we structured the program the way we did is we were really focused on minimizing the churn off of that maintenance base. So we feel that the way we structured the program, the huge incentives for loyalty that we're giving the maintenance customers is really a churn minimization plan. So we're feeling pretty confident. Our competitors have historically tried to make incursions into our installed base as we move to subscription, but the truth of the matter is none of them have been particularly successful and it's really hard to compete with software that that prices and accessibility levels that are far below what they've been historically when you come in with more expensive perpetual software. So yes competitors try to make encourage their incursions. They haven't been successful and I think we structured this program as a churn minimization program with a primary goal. Monika Garg Got it. Thank you so much. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks, Monika. End of Q&A Operator Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn things over to David Gennarelli for any closing comments. David Gennarelli Thanks, Karen. That concludes our conference call for today.

We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, unless otherwise noted each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Amar. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks Dave. We’re after an impressive start with the new fiscal year with broad based strength across all subscription types and geographies. These types of results are increasing our confident in the acceptance of the subscription model and our ability to achieve our goals. There are several areas to highlight in Q1 including, we added a record 186,000 total subscriptions. Total ARR grew 20% at constant currency. Recurring revenue jumped to 90% of total revenue and we over-achieve on both our revenue and spend goal, leading to better than expected in EPS. As we’ve demonstrated over the past several quarters, we are executing well and making real progress on our two major initiatives, growing the lifetime customer value by moving customers to the subscription model and expanding our market opportunity with increasing adoption of our cloud based solutions. Now let’s dive to our Q1 performance a little more. Before I get too far, I want to note a change in our terminology. New model is now known simply as subscription plan to synchronize with our new revenue reporting terminology. Just like new model, subscription plan consists of product subscriptions and end-of-life subscriptions and cloud subscriptions. We added 233,000 subscription plan subs in Q1, which is even higher, there are seasonality strong fourth quarter of last year. Once more the net record 186,000 total subscription additions resulting from strength across all subscription plan types and a higher renewal rate for maintenance planned subs. One of the best signal with the health of our business with the strong demand for our core designing engineering product, which is reflected in impressive year-over-year growth of over 170% in product subscriptions even more pleasing was the strength in product subscriptions was broad based, with triple digit growth across all geographies and very strong growth in emerging markets. Once again, new customers represented about a third of our new product subscriptions for the quarter. These new customers come from a mix of market expansion, growing in emerging countries, unlicensed users and people who have been using an alternate design tool. Subscription plans starts also had a strong contribution from our new enterprise customers. I mentioned on last quarter's call that in Q4, we had signed up a record number of enterprise customers for our token base of consumption style EDAs, and that because of the way we count our subscriptions, we see the benefit to net new subscriptions in Q1 just as we did in the first quarter of last 2 fiscal years. These EDAs contributed a record 44,000 subscription additions in Q1 of this year, 10% more than Q1 of last year. EDAs with our large enterprise customers have been a very successful component of our transition leading to both increased subscriptions and account value while creating increased flexibility for our customers.  The third component of our subscription plan starts is our cloud products. This is the TAM expansion part of our business and we are building on our leadership in the cloud. Cloud subscription additions continue to show strong growth growing by over 4 times Q1 of last year, and these were driven by BIM 360, our BIM collaboration and construction management tool and closely followed by Fusion our cloud-based design and fabrication tool. In addition to brand new customers to our cloud products, we are also doing a lot of add on business with our existing cloud customers. A great example of this was a large Australian construction company which had already deployed over a 1000 seats of BIM 360. The company is now expanding the deployment of BIM 360 and integrating it into their project management system which has resulted in the purchase of an additional 3000 seats of BIM 360 by that customer. BIM 360 goes beyond a typical product sale and has allowed us to develop much more strategic relationships with [indiscernible] and other companies as we kept into this huge potential TAM of the construction market, the fee in AEC. Some of you may have seen that just last week there was a great story in the Wall Street Journal that highlighted that opportunity and prominently featured Autodesk. Fusion 360 is also expanding our market opportunity. We had a great Q1 win with a UK-based engineering firm that is choosing to replace Team Center with Fusion Lifecycle. This customer also purchased product design collection, which includes Fusion 360 which successfully completed against DSO and PPP solutions. The more people used fusion, the more they are reinforcing our believe that Fusion is a game changer that's driving the future of making things at the expense of our competition. Partially offsetting the growth in subscription plan subs was the expected decline in maintenance plant sales. However, maintenance planned subs declined less than what we experienced in Q4 through a combination of a higher renewal rate and a smaller pool of renewal opportunities. As we stated in the past, we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance plan subscriptions going forward. The rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions that come up for renewal, the renewal rate at the time and our ability to incest maintenance planned customers to switch over to EBAs or product subscriptions without maintenance to subscription program.  I’ll now turn it over to Andrew to provide more details on the great results we saw in Q1.  Andrew Anagnost Thanks, Amar. The strong growth in total subscription is fueling growth in ARR. Subscription plan ARR surged 105% on a constant currency basis and reflect the strong uptake of all our subscription plan offerings. Total ARR grew by over 100 million quarter-over-quarter and 20% over Q1 last year on a constant currency basis. And I’ll point out this 40% of our total ARR is now driven by [technical difficulty] that’s up from just 23% in Q1 last year and a clear indicator of significant progress we're making. When we accelerated the transition away perpetual licenses two years ago. We projected the subscription plan ARR with maintenance plan during this fiscal year and we are well on the way to making that happen. For the second consecutive quarter, we experience the small sequential increase in total ARPS, primarily driven by ARPS growth in product subscription. It's still a little too early to project what ARPS will grow sequentially in Q2 and ARPS is still sensitive to short-term shifts and term length, geo mix, product mix and promotions. Having said that, we remain confident that ARPS will be positively influence in the second half of the year by less discounting and promotions to our legacy users, as well as the impact of the maintenance and subscription program. Each quarter, the vast majority of the subscription plan subs are added through traditional maintenance. However, we continue to make meaningful progress in converting non-paying users into subscribers. In Q1, we added 26,000 product subscriptions to another successful promo target in our legacy users. The Q1 promo offer 30% discount on a three-year subscription is they turn in their old perpetual licenses. It's the same type of promo that added 28,000 subs in Q1 last year with 70% discount. We’re still finding that more than half of those particularly in the promo are turning in licenses seven years back or older. This is further reinforcing our view, that there are meaningful number of active users whose licenses are more than five years old and are interested in moving to latest software. They are continuing to be over 2 million of these legacy users that are actively using our all perpetual license. Overtime, we will convert a large portion of these users either through promotions like this, compelling new product introductions or traditional means as their product becomes increasingly update overtime, we’re beginning to see this happen already. The other large cohort non-paying users, the non-compliance or piracy based of roughly 12 million worldwide. We’ve made significant gains and being able to more accurately identify these non-compliance users and we’re just getting underway with systemically pursue convergence to subscription. Driving more users to subscription directly aligned with another one of our transition related initiatives to drive more business direct. Total direct revenue for the first quarter was 30% of total revenue, that's up from 25% in Q1 last year and just 19% two years ago. We continue to grow the volume of business with our large enterprise customers and we’re experiencing exceptional growth of over 300% with our e-store. We expect to continue to meaningfully growth both our direct to enterprise and our e-store business as we go forward. Now I'll close my section by talking a little bit more about the maintenance and subscription program, because it was easily the most asked about topics over the past quarters. At the end of the Q1, we had nearly 2 million maintenance planned customers and we're going to encourage these customers to move to product subscriptions. We'd like them to do so sooner rather than later as product subscription provides them the great value with increased flexibility support and access to our cloud products. Moving to single model makes the more sense and we'll immensely simplify our customer's transactions with Autodesk. The M2S kicks off with maintenance planned customers that come up for renewal starting on June 1 which is just a couple of weeks away. Along with greater value, loyalty pricing will be a big driver. As I discussed last quarter, all maintenance customers will be subject to a 5% price increase when they come up to renewal and they can choose to move to product subscription for a loyalty discounts of 60% less than the cost of a new product subscription and lots of pricing for the following two years. With this discount will decreased by 5% for each of the following 2 years, so the earlier customers wish the more they'll save. The maintenance planned customer can choose to stay on maintenance, but they will be subject to a 10% increase next year and 20% increase the year after that. As such, we believe that there will be a relatively small number of maintenance planned customers by the end of FY'20 and we'll be determining the best course of actions for the subsequent renewal periods. Since we announce this program a couple of months ago, we have been working with our partners to help them better understand the program. We've also provided them with some extra tools that help drive positive conversations with customers and we are incentivizing the channel partners to up sell collections, which would further enhance their cash flow. We're not making projections [technical difficulty] will move over this year or next, but believe we will have a smaller pool of maintenance customers by the time we get to the end of our fiscal year '20. Now I'll turn it over to Scott for a closer look at some of the financials. Scott Herren Thanks Andrew. Once again, all of you should have the prepared remarks document, which is the best source for our financial details. So I'm not going to walk through all of them, but if you want to hit on a couple of noteworthy items, and then talk about our business outlook for fiscal 18.  Before I get into the numbers, I want to draw your attention to our new format for revenue reporting which greatly improves transparency. You'll now see 3 revenue lines, one for subscription, one for maintenance and one for license and other revenues. In this format, you'll no longer need the reconciliation table in our prepared remarks doc as all subscription revenue which we used to call new model will be reported in the subscription line and all maintenance revenue will be recorded in maintenance line. All remaining non-recurring revenue will be reported as license and other revenue. In this new format, quarterly subscription revenue times four equals subscription ARR and quarterly maintenance revenue times four equals to maintenance ARR and you'll be better able to isolate non-recurring revenues that will flow into the license and other revenue line. Note that one side effect in this change results in additional small legacy products being added into the ARR calculation. As a result, we have slightly adjusted the historical figures for ARR, so that you have an apples-to-apples comparison for our Q1 results in going forward.  This is an improvement we've been working on and many of you've been asking for the quite a while and I think we can all agree this is clear and more transparent. Moving to spend management, we're proud that we've been able to drive strong growth in all of our important transition metrics while reducing our Q1 non-GAAP spend by 3%. We know that some of you have been skeptical of our ability to grow our business while keeping spend flat this year and next year, but we continue to achieve our goals by making sure that we're investing in critical elements of our transition while reducing spend in other areas, driving efficiencies throughout the company and the best thing smaller non-core products. During the stage of our transition, deferred revenue is a better measure of our business than reported revenue. Deferred revenue grew 18% against the really tough compare last year, when we were still selling multi-year maintenance contracts. As you know with discontinued multi-year maintenance sales in conjunction with the launch of the maintenance subscription program. You’ll notice another new discloser we added this quarter for unbilled deferred revenue, which we define simply as revenue that has been contractually committed by our customers, but not yet billed and not included on balance sheet. Specifically driven by our multi-year large enterprise business agreements or EBAs. Historically, unbilled deferred revenue was an immaterial number, but as we move forward this year. We’re planning or moving more of our enterprise customers to annual billings with the contract, which are typically three-year commitments. We are providing visibility for unbilled deferred revenue to give you a more holistic view on our quarterly results. We remained aggressive with our stock buyback plan in Q1 and repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total of $192 million and that averages out to a little over $85 per share. The downside of our stock price at this level is we’re not able to buyback quite as many shares, but we remain committed to offsetting dilution from our equity plans and reducing our share count over China. Overall, our strong Q1 results increased our confidence with the transition is working for our customers and our partners, it also sets us up for success for the rest of the year and reinforces our conviction in our fiscal ’20 targets. Turning to our outlook our view of the global economic conditions remains consistent with our view of the past several quarters, but most of the mature markets performing relatively well and little change in emerging markets. As we look at our outlook for the second quarter, we expect a seasonal decrease in subscriptions additions in Q2 consistent with what we’ve seen in the last two years. In the Q1 sub ads have added benefit from a seasonally strong EBAs solid prior quarter and the legacy promo. However, we're pleased with our execution in the current business trends and have confidence in our ability to drive results, we’re taking appropriately conservative approach and leaving the full year fiscal ’18 outlook unchanged at this point. Finally, I want to provide an update on our CEO transition. The board is currently in the process of vetting external candidates, as well as both Andrew and Amar. We don’t have any other update on the CEO selection process, other than to say it's a top priority for the board and is progressing as plan. In the meantime, we continue to execute very well through the transition and Andrew and Amar have the board’s full confident to lead the company to ongoing success. To wrap things up, we’ve executed well over the past several quarters and we are looking forward to building on this through fiscal 2018 and work toward our fiscal ’20 goals and beyond. Operator, we’d now like to open up the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Mark Grant Hi, thanks. This is Mark Grant on for Heather. Just a quick one for me. Are you mentioned that the maintenance renewals were a little bit better in the quarter than you’d seen in recent trends? Was there a possibility in the quarter that you had maintenance renewal kind of pulled forward customers coming forward and trying to renew maintenance ahead of the maintenance to subscription transition? And then quick follow-up to that is on the full year guidance of, reason for not raising the full year guidance for such a great quarter? Amarpreet Hanspal Yes. So on the maintenance question, maintenance was better than expected really. I think we had a small group of renewals and I think most of our customers who renewed were trying to line-up with the maintenance to subscription transactions. We didn't see any unnatural pull forward into the quarter. And it was better than expected and we expect to continue to do well with the renewal rates because we paying a lot of attention to it.  Andrew Anagnost Yes, and on the second part of your question the full year guide. we've executed well over the last several quarters and certainly executed well in Q1. That's giving us increased confidence as both the transition is working for our customers, but it's also working for our partners and we feel good about where we are at this point in the year, but there is long way to go. It's 90 days into a full year at this point, I think it's appropriate to be prudent with the guide for the full year. Mark Grant Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.  Philip Winslow Hey, thanks guys and congrats on a what was at those Q1. Question for Andrew and Scott, going back to the maintenance because, obviously, just overall subscriber count growth was well ahead of people's expectations and the maintenance decline was definitely less than what we were expecting. Curious [technical difficulty] obviously, there are a lot of changes going on pricing, but wondering if you can comment on just the feedback you're getting from customers and sort of the early thoughts on sort of how you expect this to play out. I know you're not getting specific guidance, but maybe kind a help us walk us through and how you're hearing and how you're thinking about that? Andrew Anagnost Yeah Phil, let me talk to it. So first off, let me remind you how structured this program so we can put some of the feedback in context. It's a multi-year program, we've rolled out 3 years' worth of changes in the customer base, so that they could actually get a lot of visibility to what they could expect over the next few years. The first year is modest price increases, the program starts June 1 and you're going to see a 5% price increase. So whether you are a maintenance customers that really wants to see in maintenance or wants to move to subscription now, you're really going to renew and move forward and take -- you're going to take an action, a positive actions. Because you got a year ahead to think about it. And what we're going to be doing in that year is we're going to be collecting the customer reaction and we're also going to be demonstrating to the customers more explicitly why there is more value in the subscription world. The value is going to show up just the nature of the offering, we just talk about access controlling insights. We're also going to be adding a lot more value related to bringing the cloud much closer to the subscription offering. So we give the customers lots of runway. We expected there was going to be different types of reaction at the program, which is one of the reasons why we built in this year for people to digest what we're doing. So as we've rolled it out we've gotten reaction from some of our larger customers whether we're just looking at it and they're going, we were going to move to subscriptions anyway or we're going to move to an EPA. So we're going to probably move forward with a lowest price possible. Our smaller customers are where we've gotten the most noise. And essentially, they're concerned about losing access to their perpetual software. That's why we got the one year cooling off period for us to absorb this feedback, for us to engage with these customers and for us to really prove to them that not only are they moving to a better higher value offering but we're going to protect them as they move forward. So that's where we're at right now, and I wouldn't expect anything else to change. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays.  Saket Kalia Actually, maybe I'll start with you Scott. So, subscription ARPS, to the point earlier saw at second quarter of sequential growth here. You've talked about this being a little bit of a volatile metric, because of the mix in the past. You see like we’re getting some point, where some of the higher price subscriptions or really having a structural impact on the ARPS number. Where we could see a little bit more stability in that metric going forward? Andrew Anagnost This is Andrew, I’m going to take that one. Saket Kalia Sure. Andrew Anagnost As we said, this metric is highly sensitive to mix, it’s highly sensitive not only in the product mix, but also the geo mix, whether it’s emerging in mature markets. And what we’ve said consistently and we’re sticking to it, is that we move into the second half of the year, we’re going to start to see that metric trend up. And we’re not changing, we’re not changing that guidance. I want to remind you thought about some of the things that are going to keep pushing that up. One, we’re going to be absorbing that maintenance to subscription price increased, the 5% that pushes into the ecosystem, so that’s going and trend that up a bit. You’re also going to see some core price increases and the moved to collections, it’s going to put upward pressure on that. We’re also going to see the decreasing discount, remember with the discount just around a fraction of what it was in previous years on our legacy programs, you’re going to see that. But you’re also going to see the mix in mature and emerging change, which is going to puts some positive pressure. As we’re more successful in the cloud, you’re going to see downward pressure. So those are the factors that are going to be affecting this, as we move it to the second half of the year, but we’re holding to the statement we made previously, you are going to see a trend up as we move to the second half. Saket Kalia Got it. That’s really helpful. And then my follow-up, maybe for you Amar. It sounds like in some of your prepared commentary, that some of the competitive wins, sounds like just a little bit stronger this quarter. Can you just talk maybe qualitatively about any competitive metrics that you look out whether that's win rates or competitive conversions? Talk to us a little bit about maybe how you feel competitively this quarter maybe versus others? Amarpreet Hanspal Saket, great question, thanks. We definitely feeling the positive about how we’re position in the industry and how they driving change. Our investment of strategy of using the cloud to drive a new paradigm and look billing industry, as well as manufacturing industry is really paying off. In manufacturing in particular with Fusion and the changes we’re driving and getting industrial additive manufacturing and causes by genetic design, customers are really paying a lot of attention and adopting those ideas from us in a big way. And in many cases at the expense of our competition, in fact many of our Fusion 360 wins this quarter, in fact in an increasing rate are coming and the expense of our competition. Leaving sort of old, 20-year old [indiscernible] CAD systems and starting to adopt the paradigm we've putting forward with Fusion, which connects CAD to CAM to CAE [ph], with data management build-in.  So in manufacturing we really feel like the customer is searching for the next paradigm and they’re starting to really turn to Fusion and adopt it in response to that. Likewise, in the building industry, the big several competitive push that in success that we’re seeing is really in construction. I would say, actually a major competitor has been paid for in some ways that they are moving from an analog to a digital ways of working, and we've been leading the way in using cloud and mobile to drive a construction management and BIM management process for those customers. So definitely we’re feeling both of those factors and manufacturing construction growing at a really fast pace, we feel very good about where we're positioned in both industries. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst Thanks guys, it's Jack [indiscernible] on for Sterling tonight. Couple of questions from us, the first being in the revenue by product family, looks like AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT actually grew year-over-year as far as the major segments are concerned. Any particular reason that that return to growth in the quarter whereas AEC and manufacturing are still down year-over-year? Andrew Anagnost Yeah, Jack. When you look at that you've got to reflect back what was happened in Q1 and year ago. It was our first quarter without selling any perpetual licenses on AutoCAD and LT. And you remember when we ended the sale at the end of the prior quarter in Q4 there were some buy ahead activities. So with AutoCAD and LT Q1 a year ago, so the compare point was a little bit artificially low with some demand pulled backward into the prior year. That's part of what contributed to it, I would say we're seeing very strong uptick though for both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, and the LT family with product subscription. So it's a combination of both.  Amarpreet Hanspal Right, and what I'd actually was Scott you said it's one of the, we're seeing subscription working everywhere around the world. One of the geographies which really did well for us sequentially is APAC. And APAC has all is been a strong contributor to the AutoCAD and LT results and that's sort of reflected in the numbers you're seeing. The other thing I would say, you made a comment about AEC and manufacturing, I would just take this opportunity to say, in manufacturing one other thing is going on is a [indiscernible] business moved from a perpetual license business to a subscription business over these quarters and that sort of reflected in those numbers. So I would say that manufacturing numbers be a downward trend of that is exaggerated because of that shift of revenue upfront from readable, but performing strongly across all industries, we feel very good about where we are. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great. thank you. And then actually since you mentioned geographies for my follow up, it appears that at least on revenue basis year-over-year Americas did a little bit better than the other major geographies. Is that also true as far as bookings are concerned, or was there just a little bit of some noise in the revenue for the regions? Andrew Anagnost Yeah Jack, we actually did well in all regions. I think it's one thing to look at it year-over-year, if you look at it sequentially, we actually did well in Americas, in Europe and in APAC and as Amar just pointed out, actually it seem to have at least on the bottom in APAC and don't have the same headwind that we had for most of the year last year there. So it does nothing that stands out that was particularly strong or particularly weak in any of the 3GOs, it was good performance across the board. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities.  Jay Vleeschhouwer  Question number one, perhaps for Andrew and Amar is, if you could talk about the role of distribution or distributors in the future. Have you see their roles in terms of fulfillments license management, et cetera? And as well could you talk about the effects of any past or perspective pricing changes if you put through distribution. In other words, you've changed the pricing for bars looking to purchase directly from the company versus perhaps more favorable pricing let's say, big buy to distribution instead. And then secondly, in the first quarter, it would appear that collections, have you seen in the direct business where a smaller percentage of the business than the former suites had been. Could you verify that and how are you thinking about the progression of collection as percentage of the business as you go through the rest of the year? Andrew Anagnost All right. So Jay, that was a multi-part question. So let me go through each one of these, one at a time. So look when it comes to bars and distribution in our future, let's be very quick. Our business is going to be bigger and the size of the pie that the bars we’re going to get the size of the business, if they're going to be able to participate will be bigger as well. We are going to be doing to be doing more business direct through major accounts and direct to the e-store, but we are absolutely going to be providing a bigger business to our indirect partners as well as we move forward. Now your question with regarding the pricing to [indiscernible] things like that. We are constantly evolving and changing our frameworks and changing the pricing and the things that go through the framework to optimize where the things are going.  I'm not going to comment on any specific pricing strategy we put out there in the system, but we’re always doing that to optimize how we distribute and deliver the software and the customers. I mean your last question is about collections. So first, I would talk about where is the overall strategy going with collections. It’s absolutely our goal to ensure that our new customers are moving to collections versus buying standalone products. And as you know we light up the main subscription program in June, there is going to be a major push to move those customers over that collections. Those activities are brewing and gestational right now. But with regards to collection results, we’re actually really happy where we’re at. The volume runway in Q1 is equivalent to suites run rate in the same period a year ago and that’s exactly where we want to be. In the short period of time, we basically gotten back up to that runway and that’s like where we should be. But as we move forward into the year, you’re going to see collections contribution go up more and more and throughout the year. But right now we’re exactly where we select to these. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss Excellent. Nice quarter guys and thank you for taking the questions. I just wondering if you could talk a little bit about better renewal rates on the main side of equations. I wondering if you could give us any sort of viewpoint on sort of the renewal rates on the new model such as the subscription subject if you will, get a little time under your belt. How are those coming in and particularly how to those look relatively to sort of what you’d see in your maintenance is? Scott Herren Yes. The renewal rates was strong across the board, I mean the product subscription rates were right in line with our expectations. It doesn’t compare maintenance to product subscriptions, I mean, one thing that keep in mind is, one of the benefits of the product subscription is customers switch things on and off and some on monthly and some on quarterly subscribers. So you don’t really get the new rates of by subscription types, but we are pleased with where product subscriptions ended up and this continues to be a big focus area for us for remainder of the year.  Keith Weiss Got it. And then my second question. I mean to continue in the line of question that Jay was going down on the reseller channel. Now they were fully on a subscription model. Can you tell us a little bit about sort of what the incentives and what is the incentive program look like for the channel and broad stocks? Is that on ARR, is it on subscription. Give us some any indication of where you took that now that it's not going to be kind of a revenue base model anymore? Andrew Anagnost Actually no. This is Andrew. So the incentives we put into the systems for partners are aligned with the kind of outcomes we want with subscriptions. For example, we're obviously going to incent them to encourage the customer to look at collection, because obviously that's something we've really want the customer to consider and we think that's the right path for them moving forward and best path for the future. So we also want them send adoption and renewal activity, so we actually putting incentives into the system do ensure that the partners are making sure that the customers are actually using the software because like Amar said, when you're on a subscription model, you can start and stop if you want, so we want the partners to guarantee that the customers are actually adopting things. we put incentives into the system like that to drive that kind of behavior. Amarpreet Hanspal Yeah I agree and keep that just add to that overtime, you see us continuing to optimize our incentive structure to drive the kind of results and the outcomes that we want. Subscriptions obviously is a big focus for us right now driving collections is a big focus for us right now. And since I've been making sure that our renewal rates are right where we want it to be in and then we're using our classic combination of front and backend discounts to get those results. And as Jay's earlier comment with the distribution channel that's another place where we've been sort of just optimizing our relationships and our incentive structure to get the right results again to drive this overall recurring revenue and subscription business that we are getting the channel oriented around. Keith Weiss To be absolutely clear, I mean, is it fair to say that in terms of whether or not a partner hit plan or not point quarter if you will. Did ARR reached base revenues or is it just there is a whole collection of things they [indiscernible]. Amarpreet Hanspal Can you say that again ARR and then we lost the second part of the question. Keith Weiss So in terms of sort of like from a headline number per partners you guys have done do business reviews. Is there a version of a quarter, like when they hit plan does ARR replace whether revenue used to be, they used to have to hit the revenue target, now they are at ARR target or is it little bit complicated in that? Amarpreet Hanspal Our engagements with partner is very simple, we talk about billings numbers with them and building outcomes with them and the annualized contract value. We don't try to do ARR compensation models with our partner channel, that would be far too complicated for them to not only engage with, but actually for them to measure and react to. So we keep that very simple because we want to their transactional ability.  Operator Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.  Gregg Moskowitz  Okay thanks very much and good afternoon guys. Wondering if you could add any commentary on the mix of LT subscriptions this quarter as compared with both AutoCAD and the AutoCAD Vertical subscriptions. Scott Herren Yeah hi Gregg. LT continues to be the volume part of the business, as it did was in the perpetual license world it is in the product subscription world. We're not seeing a significant shift in the mix of LT either going at a higher percent on a volume basis on a lower percent, LT and AutoCAD kind a continue to hold serve at the level they were. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay. Amarpreet Hanspal Go ahead sorry. Gregg Moskowitz  Sorry Amar, go ahead.  Amarpreet Hanspal I think we saw product strength across all products including the Verticals as well as the Vertical product the two new Vertical products, there wasn't a single standout product that was driving -- these all strength across the board. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay, perfect. And then just a question for Andrew, find it’s really interesting that you got essentially the same amount of legacy on subscriber conversions this quarter, at a 30% discount as you did a year ago at 70% discount and that you’re still seeing half of the conversions at an aging that in seven years or older. So the question is in the past you’ve spoken about a 30% conversion rate of licensees that were five years older or less. Is there any reason why the conversion percentage can be a lot of higher than that? Andrew Anagnost Look, we’re going to continue to convert very highly rates, let's make sure that we’re clear on exactly how are going to be converting the customers, because the promo are only one measure of our conversion success. It’s a three pronged strategy we are looking at to bring the customers in. One is the pace of functionality that we update in the existing products, so is the ecosystem become very much out of date, very quickly for the customers that stay off the current release. The other aspects of the things that we’re doing is entangling the cloud value so deeply in the subscription offering, that the customers are really compelled to get that value captured and integrated in their processes. More and more the cloud offerings are going to becomes super critical to what our customers do and that's going to get deeply entangling into the subscription offering. The last bit was these legacy promos and these offerings that we use. These are not the -- that’s not the absolute measure of legacy conversion, just the fact that we’re doing the kinds of net ads, but you see here means that we’re dipping into these non-subscriber's basis. We’re going to continue to do it and we’re going to continue to do it at reasonable rates and I think the program is working exactly as we said that it will. Amarpreet Hanspal One of the things that we have peace with is that, we didn’t have to discount aggressively to get the kind of sub results that we saw. And as Andrew mentioned, I mean, I think as some ways the net as number is becoming a better indicator, how where we are converting our overall opportunity than any individual promotion to reach the second [indiscernible] base. As Andrew said, at some level there is a network affecting being built as our new products rollout and customers want to be current and many of the sales select into the buying and use subscription to be current. So I think overall, we’re seeing the promo work, we’re seeing usually net sales is go up, because of the new product subscribing. So I think we’re doing well with that opportunity. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay. That’s great. Thank you. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Citigroup. Ken Wong Scott, I know you guys mentioned flat total spend for the year. But how should we think about the trajectory of sales and marketing, once you guys launch the maintenance to subs program. Would that tick up meaningfully? Scott Herren I don’t think so, Ken. You saw that for the first quarter, we actually posted a decline in spend of about 3% during Q1. Obviously for us to be flat for the year, it’s not going to stay minus 3% throughout the year. So I would expect to see slight increases going forward, but that still comes in flat for the year. And there is no particular swing between categories as we rollout maintenance to subscriptions. Maintenance to subs is obviously a huge focus, both of our sales team for our channel. But I don’t see that driving any particular bump and extends.  Ken Wong Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up on just receivables. So it was, I guess it was count pretty good amount from what it was last year. Can you remind us something last year drive up accounts receivable collections much more than typical? Scott Herren Yes. What drives receivables of course is linear in the quarter. What get sold during the quarter in the last month because we in most cases, we bill in that 30. So we had a very linear quarter this quarter if you look at our DSOs this quarter, they were below 45, I think 43 days, whereas last quarter it was a much more backend loaded quarter. So you just think of linearity during the quarter as nothing else that's happened that would skew that one way or the another. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Your line is now open.  Unidentified Analyst Hi, this is Shanker for Kash thanks for letting me ask question, and congrats on the good results. I have a question on the maintenance conversion. So my understand is that if the maintenance customers currently using LT or AutoCAD product, he would most slightly shift to an LT or AutoCAD products in subscription it's in the customer convert. So in that context if you can you elaborate how -- discount you're offering, how else are you incentivizing the customer to adopt collections? From a geographical mix as well how customers.  Scott Herren So the mainly, the way the program is structured is that, the customer that's moving at the time can move like-for-like they can move LT to LT or AutoCAD to AutoCAD but they're never going to get a better price to move to a collection than they will at that point. The discount on collection that they get is the same 60% discount they get moving for like-for-like. So there is a strong incentive in the system especially for an AutoCAD customer to consider a collection. Probably less so for an LT customer but definitely for an AutoCAD customer. And what we've done as we've armed our partner channels all across the world we basically tool that let them sit down with the customers and say hey, here are your options, here is what happens if you move now, here is what happened if you move next year. And by the way, if you move to a collection this is the price you lock in and this is the value you get with regards to the product offerings. So we put a lot of work into educating the channel in particular and how to have a conversation with the customer in terms of moving up to a collection.  Amarpreet Hanspal This is simply our partners know how to do, and this is a one -- it's not just incentive for the customers, our partners really take advantage of this one-time opportunity to move their customers to a higher recurring revenue base, and I think they're really focused on that opportunity right now. Unidentified Analyst Got it. Just a follow up question, you mentioned above the smaller customers having an issue with the subscription plan and you're working with them. Could you elaborate the feedback they received on potential price increases that could happen post fiscal '20? Are there any pushbacks on that or what the strategy there? Andrew Anagnost Like I said, the feedback the negative feedback we've got was exactly what we've expected. When you announce to a customer that their maintenance prices are going up over a three-year period. You expect to get some feedback that's not necessarily positive. It has primarily been from the smaller customers and when you look at their main issue, it's doesn’t come down to maintenance versus subscription. They recognize that the program we've put in place puts reasonable price increases for them and they get they love the royalty program. What they are worried about is giving up their perpetual license. So what we are just we're just next year and the by the way it is over this next year. Because they're obviously going to renew at a 5% increase is essentially show the customers that they need small accounts, that moving to a subscription is a more valuable path for them and something that helps them accomplish what they need to do more effectively. We're committed to doing that and that's really going to be the essence of our response to these customers is delivering the value they're expecting to see and helping them understand exactly what they get when they move to subscription.  Amarpreet Hanspal Well I think one thing you noticed in talking to our partners. when we first announced this program and like got a much of reaction And then as our customers started talking to our partners. I mean a lot of that concern has started to going down, because of all the thing that Andrew said, that our customers are starting to understand better, the value proposition or subscription and kind of pricing one that we're putting in. And so I think that there was a little bit of component, we maybe an upstream, but that is really starting to new and customers are much more comfortable with the path that we have put forward. Unidentified Analyst If I may just ask one more, this as a follow-up to that. Is there any difference in the geography versus U.S. versus Europe versus Asia is there any difference and how customers reacted? Andrew Anagnost No. The reactions fairly uniformed. I mean, obviously you get some smaller variations, but it’s really uniform and it’s very similar to the reaction we got when we announced the end of perpetual. So it’s playing out exactly the same way and we’re going to go to the exact in process. But there is no particular geography or country that show any propensity to be concerned. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities. Steve Koenig I’m going to turn to bunch the two questions maybe at ones, because they're kind of related. So I guess first, to what extent are your plans for the discount that you'll offer on subscriptions done at the M2S program next year and the year after. Are those pretty much hard wire or might you change those? And kind of the related question is, I understand you’re not prepared to give the guide yet on the M2S program, the volumes that you will get out of the M2S program and that sensible that you’re not ready yet to do that. But to what extent -- can you give us color on to what extent to your fiscal ’20 targets depend on the price increases that you will effectively get from the maintenance customers and the converting customers? Andrew Anagnost So I’m going to answer part of that and then I’m going to let Scott speak to the other part of it. So with regard to the maintenance subscription program, look we’ve rolled out the program. We created visibility, we’ve told them, they’re getting a 60% discount, that discount goes down by 5% every year as they -- depending on what year they move. It’s our intend to stick to that program and stick to that program, we think it’s an excellent program, it's an excellent level of discount. There is really no reason to change that. So I don’t anticipate any change in the actual rules of the program. Scott Herren Yes. I hear you that Steve. And so your second question, there is interesting effect, if you look at the price increases filled into maintenance to subscription. The longest someone stays on maintenance, of course they incur higher price increases, the more they contribute to ARR. So there is a bit of a reverse, it’s a big counter inclusive. There is no dependency on a very rapid shift over, in fact the slower it goes actually boost ARR a bit as it moves along. So there is no significant dependency model on that. Steve Koenig May I clarity than Scott. Have you assumed in your long-term guide, a rapid, fairly rapid shift over, so there is fairly minimal price boost, or there is the long-term guidance require that significant number of customers stay on maintenance. Scott Herren Yes. Our long-term targets do assume that it shifts over and that the majority do shift over, but I don’t want to get into any of the details on what that looks like, I said there is an interesting play in terms of the rate and pace, that they move in the effective house [ph] in the model. As with most of the metrics in the models, Steve, we try to be somewhat conservative on those. Andrew Anagnost We have a clear goal to get as much of that maintenance phase moved over to subscription by FY '20 as we possibly can.  Steve Koenig Sounds good. Thank you.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Ken Talanian So you had a nice down tick in expenses in this quarter, and I was wondering if you could walk us through some of your key initiatives to continue to contain expenses. What elements might cause you to perform better than your current guidance on that front? Scott Herren Sure just to be clear, we typically always see a sequential down tick in spend from Q4 to Q1. Q4, as yearend, there is a lot of the true ups that happened on variable compensation plans on commissions. It’s a quarter that we have our AU events which also drives our expense. So the normal seasonality you'd expect to decline from Q4 to Q1, the rate of that decline in some ways depends on how successful we were in the prior year because submissions are not an insignificant part of that decline. So it's not a -- while it is a sequential decline and it's not unexpected sequential decline from Q4 to Q1. Amar if you want to touch on how we're managing spend? Amarpreet Hanspal So Ken, what I'd add is that outlook for the year on spend is being unchanged because we've instituted operational rigor and discipline and continue to make very hard choices in investing in the right areas to drive the transition and divest in sort of non-core projects and non-core activities and just keep a tight focus on managing spends. So our outlook for the year is unchanged and I think we're making all the right decisions in terms of ensuring that the transition remains on track. And some of the things like we decided to divest, we had a bunch of consumer products for example last year, that are not material to the transition we make choices like volume [ph] divest, and that's giving us some of the fuel we need to keep driving the transition forward. Ken Talanian Okay, great. And there is a follow up, I realized it's early, but could you give us a sense to how to think about what the price increase is might look like in the years following the initial three-year subscription discount that folks will be locking in? Will it mean -- directionally could you expect it be on par with the subscription price, absent that discount or might it even be more? Scott Herren Ken, we've been very explicit at the program where the customer pops up to the terminal discount price of the program. So the main subscription program lasts three years, and at the end of that third year, there is a particular discount. That's the price that everybody trues up to when they exit the program. Which by the way is the right thing to do with regard to incenting the customer to not only give up their perpetual license, but feel comfortable with the move to subscription. Ken Talanian Okay. And is that for EBAs as well or just product in collections? Scott Herren EBAs are a totally different process. So when customer moves to EBA, they've moved off of maintenance to a consumption model. Remember, when you go for all of these things, with regards to the way we've rolled out the prices, the way we manage the price increases at the terminal point. Our goal is to maximize the value of that maintenance base and that is all about minimizing the churn out of those customers during that base. We feel like we've created a program that balances both the price uplift and the churn factors that guide us and maximizing the value of that base, that's what's driving all of this.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest. Monika Garg  I guess first question, one which we get quite often is that. Looking at it, it seems like a low gross market, but your target of 20% subscription growth means, you need to add somewhere between 850,000 to 900,000 new subscriptions ever year. So can you maybe walk through the math to achieve that? Andrew Anagnost Yes. There is a fundamental thing we've been telling the people over and over again with regards to how this [technical difficulty]. First off, the move to subscription is reset the price points for design software pretty dramatically. So what we’re seeing is, we’re seeing increased demand for our offering, just by virtue of the fact that upfront costs are some much lower. Then there is a couple of other factors that play out here in terms of hitting those long-term subscription targets. One is the non-subscriber base we’ve been talking about over and over again throughout the last few years, those customers are moving forward. The other, which is a 2 million plus based of people. The other base is the 12 million pirate based that is going that move from pirated software to subscriptions, we know, we understand that base, we know they're moving forward. But the more important factor as we look over a five-year period. Is the market expansion, we’re going to see with the delivery of the cloud applications in both construction and manufacturing. The move to the cloud, especially in the manufacturing space starting to share shift away from our competitors to our offerings. When you add all of those things together, the 20% of subscription growth target is quite achievable and is achievable not only from growing off our existing core, but expanding into these new markets in construction and manufacturing.  Amarpreet Hanspal Monika, I just [indiscernible], we’ve always been the volume leader in the industries that serve and we continue to do that, we continue to drive as Andrew said share shift now increasingly manufacturing from traditional CADscan [ph] systems over to new cloud based disruptive system like Fusion and with the adoption of construction solutions they all expand our opportunity. And so in combination with the [indiscernible] compliance, with legacy opportunity and just the organic volume we see through job growth in the industries, I think we feel, we remain confident in our goals that we set ourselves. Monika Garg  Perfect. Thanks. And then as a follow-up. Could you share the split of subscription between EBAs, cloud and product subs? Thank you. Andrew Anagnost The one, so I could say we don’t give it at that level of granularity, the one number we have shared is the number of EBA subscription in this quarter was 44,000. And that’s really -- we sold above EBAs [ph] in Q4, you watched how they get used and adopted, or how many uses in those accounts adopt are EBA solutions and then sort of 90 days later we count the subscription. So that number was 44,000. At this point we’re not prepared to breakout cloud and product subs. But look as we’ve said, our strategy is working, our business monetization, platform transition is working, subscription is working everywhere. So we saw strength across all of those subscription types. Monika Garg  Thank you so much. Operator  Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn things back over David Gennarelli for any closing comments. David Gennarelli Thanks, operator. We’ll be at the JP Morgan conference in Boston next Tuesday and the Canaccord one-on-one conference in Toronto next Thursday. We’ll be at the Berenberg and the NASDAQ conferences in London on June 14th and 15th respectively. And last we will be hosting investor and analyst at AU London on June 21, so please let me if you'd like to be attending that event as well. So for anything else you can reach me at 415-507-6033. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation for attending today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Our first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Mark Grant Hi, thanks. This is Mark Grant on for Heather. Just a quick one for me. Are you mentioned that the maintenance renewals were a little bit better in the quarter than you’d seen in recent trends? Was there a possibility in the quarter that you had maintenance renewal kind of pulled forward customers coming forward and trying to renew maintenance ahead of the maintenance to subscription transition? And then quick follow-up to that is on the full year guidance of, reason for not raising the full year guidance for such a great quarter? Amarpreet Hanspal Yes. So on the maintenance question, maintenance was better than expected really. I think we had a small group of renewals and I think most of our customers who renewed were trying to line-up with the maintenance to subscription transactions. We didn't see any unnatural pull forward into the quarter. And it was better than expected and we expect to continue to do well with the renewal rates because we paying a lot of attention to it.  Andrew Anagnost Yes, and on the second part of your question the full year guide. we've executed well over the last several quarters and certainly executed well in Q1. That's giving us increased confidence as both the transition is working for our customers, but it's also working for our partners and we feel good about where we are at this point in the year, but there is long way to go. It's 90 days into a full year at this point, I think it's appropriate to be prudent with the guide for the full year. Mark Grant Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.  Philip Winslow Hey, thanks guys and congrats on a what was at those Q1. Question for Andrew and Scott, going back to the maintenance because, obviously, just overall subscriber count growth was well ahead of people's expectations and the maintenance decline was definitely less than what we were expecting. Curious [technical difficulty] obviously, there are a lot of changes going on pricing, but wondering if you can comment on just the feedback you're getting from customers and sort of the early thoughts on sort of how you expect this to play out. I know you're not getting specific guidance, but maybe kind a help us walk us through and how you're hearing and how you're thinking about that? Andrew Anagnost Yeah Phil, let me talk to it. So first off, let me remind you how structured this program so we can put some of the feedback in context. It's a multi-year program, we've rolled out 3 years' worth of changes in the customer base, so that they could actually get a lot of visibility to what they could expect over the next few years. The first year is modest price increases, the program starts June 1 and you're going to see a 5% price increase. So whether you are a maintenance customers that really wants to see in maintenance or wants to move to subscription now, you're really going to renew and move forward and take -- you're going to take an action, a positive actions. Because you got a year ahead to think about it. And what we're going to be doing in that year is we're going to be collecting the customer reaction and we're also going to be demonstrating to the customers more explicitly why there is more value in the subscription world. The value is going to show up just the nature of the offering, we just talk about access controlling insights. We're also going to be adding a lot more value related to bringing the cloud much closer to the subscription offering. So we give the customers lots of runway. We expected there was going to be different types of reaction at the program, which is one of the reasons why we built in this year for people to digest what we're doing. So as we've rolled it out we've gotten reaction from some of our larger customers whether we're just looking at it and they're going, we were going to move to subscriptions anyway or we're going to move to an EPA. So we're going to probably move forward with a lowest price possible. Our smaller customers are where we've gotten the most noise. And essentially, they're concerned about losing access to their perpetual software. That's why we got the one year cooling off period for us to absorb this feedback, for us to engage with these customers and for us to really prove to them that not only are they moving to a better higher value offering but we're going to protect them as they move forward. So that's where we're at right now, and I wouldn't expect anything else to change. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays.  Saket Kalia Actually, maybe I'll start with you Scott. So, subscription ARPS, to the point earlier saw at second quarter of sequential growth here. You've talked about this being a little bit of a volatile metric, because of the mix in the past. You see like we’re getting some point, where some of the higher price subscriptions or really having a structural impact on the ARPS number. Where we could see a little bit more stability in that metric going forward? Andrew Anagnost This is Andrew, I’m going to take that one. Saket Kalia Sure. Andrew Anagnost As we said, this metric is highly sensitive to mix, it’s highly sensitive not only in the product mix, but also the geo mix, whether it’s emerging in mature markets. And what we’ve said consistently and we’re sticking to it, is that we move into the second half of the year, we’re going to start to see that metric trend up. And we’re not changing, we’re not changing that guidance. I want to remind you thought about some of the things that are going to keep pushing that up. One, we’re going to be absorbing that maintenance to subscription price increased, the 5% that pushes into the ecosystem, so that’s going and trend that up a bit. You’re also going to see some core price increases and the moved to collections, it’s going to put upward pressure on that. We’re also going to see the decreasing discount, remember with the discount just around a fraction of what it was in previous years on our legacy programs, you’re going to see that. But you’re also going to see the mix in mature and emerging change, which is going to puts some positive pressure. As we’re more successful in the cloud, you’re going to see downward pressure. So those are the factors that are going to be affecting this, as we move it to the second half of the year, but we’re holding to the statement we made previously, you are going to see a trend up as we move to the second half. Saket Kalia Got it. That’s really helpful. And then my follow-up, maybe for you Amar. It sounds like in some of your prepared commentary, that some of the competitive wins, sounds like just a little bit stronger this quarter. Can you just talk maybe qualitatively about any competitive metrics that you look out whether that's win rates or competitive conversions? Talk to us a little bit about maybe how you feel competitively this quarter maybe versus others? Amarpreet Hanspal Saket, great question, thanks. We definitely feeling the positive about how we’re position in the industry and how they driving change. Our investment of strategy of using the cloud to drive a new paradigm and look billing industry, as well as manufacturing industry is really paying off. In manufacturing in particular with Fusion and the changes we’re driving and getting industrial additive manufacturing and causes by genetic design, customers are really paying a lot of attention and adopting those ideas from us in a big way. And in many cases at the expense of our competition, in fact many of our Fusion 360 wins this quarter, in fact in an increasing rate are coming and the expense of our competition. Leaving sort of old, 20-year old [indiscernible] CAD systems and starting to adopt the paradigm we've putting forward with Fusion, which connects CAD to CAM to CAE [ph], with data management build-in.  So in manufacturing we really feel like the customer is searching for the next paradigm and they’re starting to really turn to Fusion and adopt it in response to that. Likewise, in the building industry, the big several competitive push that in success that we’re seeing is really in construction. I would say, actually a major competitor has been paid for in some ways that they are moving from an analog to a digital ways of working, and we've been leading the way in using cloud and mobile to drive a construction management and BIM management process for those customers. So definitely we’re feeling both of those factors and manufacturing construction growing at a really fast pace, we feel very good about where we're positioned in both industries. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst Thanks guys, it's Jack [indiscernible] on for Sterling tonight. Couple of questions from us, the first being in the revenue by product family, looks like AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT actually grew year-over-year as far as the major segments are concerned. Any particular reason that that return to growth in the quarter whereas AEC and manufacturing are still down year-over-year? Andrew Anagnost Yeah, Jack. When you look at that you've got to reflect back what was happened in Q1 and year ago. It was our first quarter without selling any perpetual licenses on AutoCAD and LT. And you remember when we ended the sale at the end of the prior quarter in Q4 there were some buy ahead activities. So with AutoCAD and LT Q1 a year ago, so the compare point was a little bit artificially low with some demand pulled backward into the prior year. That's part of what contributed to it, I would say we're seeing very strong uptick though for both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, and the LT family with product subscription. So it's a combination of both.  Amarpreet Hanspal Right, and what I'd actually was Scott you said it's one of the, we're seeing subscription working everywhere around the world. One of the geographies which really did well for us sequentially is APAC. And APAC has all is been a strong contributor to the AutoCAD and LT results and that's sort of reflected in the numbers you're seeing. The other thing I would say, you made a comment about AEC and manufacturing, I would just take this opportunity to say, in manufacturing one other thing is going on is a [indiscernible] business moved from a perpetual license business to a subscription business over these quarters and that sort of reflected in those numbers. So I would say that manufacturing numbers be a downward trend of that is exaggerated because of that shift of revenue upfront from readable, but performing strongly across all industries, we feel very good about where we are. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great. thank you. And then actually since you mentioned geographies for my follow up, it appears that at least on revenue basis year-over-year Americas did a little bit better than the other major geographies. Is that also true as far as bookings are concerned, or was there just a little bit of some noise in the revenue for the regions? Andrew Anagnost Yeah Jack, we actually did well in all regions. I think it's one thing to look at it year-over-year, if you look at it sequentially, we actually did well in Americas, in Europe and in APAC and as Amar just pointed out, actually it seem to have at least on the bottom in APAC and don't have the same headwind that we had for most of the year last year there. So it does nothing that stands out that was particularly strong or particularly weak in any of the 3GOs, it was good performance across the board. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities.  Jay Vleeschhouwer  Question number one, perhaps for Andrew and Amar is, if you could talk about the role of distribution or distributors in the future. Have you see their roles in terms of fulfillments license management, et cetera? And as well could you talk about the effects of any past or perspective pricing changes if you put through distribution. In other words, you've changed the pricing for bars looking to purchase directly from the company versus perhaps more favorable pricing let's say, big buy to distribution instead. And then secondly, in the first quarter, it would appear that collections, have you seen in the direct business where a smaller percentage of the business than the former suites had been. Could you verify that and how are you thinking about the progression of collection as percentage of the business as you go through the rest of the year? Andrew Anagnost All right. So Jay, that was a multi-part question. So let me go through each one of these, one at a time. So look when it comes to bars and distribution in our future, let's be very quick. Our business is going to be bigger and the size of the pie that the bars we’re going to get the size of the business, if they're going to be able to participate will be bigger as well. We are going to be doing to be doing more business direct through major accounts and direct to the e-store, but we are absolutely going to be providing a bigger business to our indirect partners as well as we move forward. Now your question with regarding the pricing to [indiscernible] things like that. We are constantly evolving and changing our frameworks and changing the pricing and the things that go through the framework to optimize where the things are going.  I'm not going to comment on any specific pricing strategy we put out there in the system, but we’re always doing that to optimize how we distribute and deliver the software and the customers. I mean your last question is about collections. So first, I would talk about where is the overall strategy going with collections. It’s absolutely our goal to ensure that our new customers are moving to collections versus buying standalone products. And as you know we light up the main subscription program in June, there is going to be a major push to move those customers over that collections. Those activities are brewing and gestational right now. But with regards to collection results, we’re actually really happy where we’re at. The volume runway in Q1 is equivalent to suites run rate in the same period a year ago and that’s exactly where we want to be. In the short period of time, we basically gotten back up to that runway and that’s like where we should be. But as we move forward into the year, you’re going to see collections contribution go up more and more and throughout the year. But right now we’re exactly where we select to these. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss Excellent. Nice quarter guys and thank you for taking the questions. I just wondering if you could talk a little bit about better renewal rates on the main side of equations. I wondering if you could give us any sort of viewpoint on sort of the renewal rates on the new model such as the subscription subject if you will, get a little time under your belt. How are those coming in and particularly how to those look relatively to sort of what you’d see in your maintenance is? Scott Herren Yes. The renewal rates was strong across the board, I mean the product subscription rates were right in line with our expectations. It doesn’t compare maintenance to product subscriptions, I mean, one thing that keep in mind is, one of the benefits of the product subscription is customers switch things on and off and some on monthly and some on quarterly subscribers. So you don’t really get the new rates of by subscription types, but we are pleased with where product subscriptions ended up and this continues to be a big focus area for us for remainder of the year.  Keith Weiss Got it. And then my second question. I mean to continue in the line of question that Jay was going down on the reseller channel. Now they were fully on a subscription model. Can you tell us a little bit about sort of what the incentives and what is the incentive program look like for the channel and broad stocks? Is that on ARR, is it on subscription. Give us some any indication of where you took that now that it's not going to be kind of a revenue base model anymore? Andrew Anagnost Actually no. This is Andrew. So the incentives we put into the systems for partners are aligned with the kind of outcomes we want with subscriptions. For example, we're obviously going to incent them to encourage the customer to look at collection, because obviously that's something we've really want the customer to consider and we think that's the right path for them moving forward and best path for the future. So we also want them send adoption and renewal activity, so we actually putting incentives into the system do ensure that the partners are making sure that the customers are actually using the software because like Amar said, when you're on a subscription model, you can start and stop if you want, so we want the partners to guarantee that the customers are actually adopting things. we put incentives into the system like that to drive that kind of behavior. Amarpreet Hanspal Yeah I agree and keep that just add to that overtime, you see us continuing to optimize our incentive structure to drive the kind of results and the outcomes that we want. Subscriptions obviously is a big focus for us right now driving collections is a big focus for us right now. And since I've been making sure that our renewal rates are right where we want it to be in and then we're using our classic combination of front and backend discounts to get those results. And as Jay's earlier comment with the distribution channel that's another place where we've been sort of just optimizing our relationships and our incentive structure to get the right results again to drive this overall recurring revenue and subscription business that we are getting the channel oriented around. Keith Weiss To be absolutely clear, I mean, is it fair to say that in terms of whether or not a partner hit plan or not point quarter if you will. Did ARR reached base revenues or is it just there is a whole collection of things they [indiscernible]. Amarpreet Hanspal Can you say that again ARR and then we lost the second part of the question. Keith Weiss So in terms of sort of like from a headline number per partners you guys have done do business reviews. Is there a version of a quarter, like when they hit plan does ARR replace whether revenue used to be, they used to have to hit the revenue target, now they are at ARR target or is it little bit complicated in that? Amarpreet Hanspal Our engagements with partner is very simple, we talk about billings numbers with them and building outcomes with them and the annualized contract value. We don't try to do ARR compensation models with our partner channel, that would be far too complicated for them to not only engage with, but actually for them to measure and react to. So we keep that very simple because we want to their transactional ability.  Operator Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.  Gregg Moskowitz  Okay thanks very much and good afternoon guys. Wondering if you could add any commentary on the mix of LT subscriptions this quarter as compared with both AutoCAD and the AutoCAD Vertical subscriptions. Scott Herren Yeah hi Gregg. LT continues to be the volume part of the business, as it did was in the perpetual license world it is in the product subscription world. We're not seeing a significant shift in the mix of LT either going at a higher percent on a volume basis on a lower percent, LT and AutoCAD kind a continue to hold serve at the level they were. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay. Amarpreet Hanspal Go ahead sorry. Gregg Moskowitz  Sorry Amar, go ahead.  Amarpreet Hanspal I think we saw product strength across all products including the Verticals as well as the Vertical product the two new Vertical products, there wasn't a single standout product that was driving -- these all strength across the board. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay, perfect. And then just a question for Andrew, find it’s really interesting that you got essentially the same amount of legacy on subscriber conversions this quarter, at a 30% discount as you did a year ago at 70% discount and that you’re still seeing half of the conversions at an aging that in seven years or older. So the question is in the past you’ve spoken about a 30% conversion rate of licensees that were five years older or less. Is there any reason why the conversion percentage can be a lot of higher than that? Andrew Anagnost Look, we’re going to continue to convert very highly rates, let's make sure that we’re clear on exactly how are going to be converting the customers, because the promo are only one measure of our conversion success. It’s a three pronged strategy we are looking at to bring the customers in. One is the pace of functionality that we update in the existing products, so is the ecosystem become very much out of date, very quickly for the customers that stay off the current release. The other aspects of the things that we’re doing is entangling the cloud value so deeply in the subscription offering, that the customers are really compelled to get that value captured and integrated in their processes. More and more the cloud offerings are going to becomes super critical to what our customers do and that's going to get deeply entangling into the subscription offering. The last bit was these legacy promos and these offerings that we use. These are not the -- that’s not the absolute measure of legacy conversion, just the fact that we’re doing the kinds of net ads, but you see here means that we’re dipping into these non-subscriber's basis. We’re going to continue to do it and we’re going to continue to do it at reasonable rates and I think the program is working exactly as we said that it will. Amarpreet Hanspal One of the things that we have peace with is that, we didn’t have to discount aggressively to get the kind of sub results that we saw. And as Andrew mentioned, I mean, I think as some ways the net as number is becoming a better indicator, how where we are converting our overall opportunity than any individual promotion to reach the second [indiscernible] base. As Andrew said, at some level there is a network affecting being built as our new products rollout and customers want to be current and many of the sales select into the buying and use subscription to be current. So I think overall, we’re seeing the promo work, we’re seeing usually net sales is go up, because of the new product subscribing. So I think we’re doing well with that opportunity. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay. That’s great. Thank you. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Citigroup. Ken Wong Scott, I know you guys mentioned flat total spend for the year. But how should we think about the trajectory of sales and marketing, once you guys launch the maintenance to subs program. Would that tick up meaningfully? Scott Herren I don’t think so, Ken. You saw that for the first quarter, we actually posted a decline in spend of about 3% during Q1. Obviously for us to be flat for the year, it’s not going to stay minus 3% throughout the year. So I would expect to see slight increases going forward, but that still comes in flat for the year. And there is no particular swing between categories as we rollout maintenance to subscriptions. Maintenance to subs is obviously a huge focus, both of our sales team for our channel. But I don’t see that driving any particular bump and extends.  Ken Wong Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up on just receivables. So it was, I guess it was count pretty good amount from what it was last year. Can you remind us something last year drive up accounts receivable collections much more than typical? Scott Herren Yes. What drives receivables of course is linear in the quarter. What get sold during the quarter in the last month because we in most cases, we bill in that 30. So we had a very linear quarter this quarter if you look at our DSOs this quarter, they were below 45, I think 43 days, whereas last quarter it was a much more backend loaded quarter. So you just think of linearity during the quarter as nothing else that's happened that would skew that one way or the another. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Your line is now open.  Unidentified Analyst Hi, this is Shanker for Kash thanks for letting me ask question, and congrats on the good results. I have a question on the maintenance conversion. So my understand is that if the maintenance customers currently using LT or AutoCAD product, he would most slightly shift to an LT or AutoCAD products in subscription it's in the customer convert. So in that context if you can you elaborate how -- discount you're offering, how else are you incentivizing the customer to adopt collections? From a geographical mix as well how customers.  Scott Herren So the mainly, the way the program is structured is that, the customer that's moving at the time can move like-for-like they can move LT to LT or AutoCAD to AutoCAD but they're never going to get a better price to move to a collection than they will at that point. The discount on collection that they get is the same 60% discount they get moving for like-for-like. So there is a strong incentive in the system especially for an AutoCAD customer to consider a collection. Probably less so for an LT customer but definitely for an AutoCAD customer. And what we've done as we've armed our partner channels all across the world we basically tool that let them sit down with the customers and say hey, here are your options, here is what happens if you move now, here is what happened if you move next year. And by the way, if you move to a collection this is the price you lock in and this is the value you get with regards to the product offerings. So we put a lot of work into educating the channel in particular and how to have a conversation with the customer in terms of moving up to a collection.  Amarpreet Hanspal This is simply our partners know how to do, and this is a one -- it's not just incentive for the customers, our partners really take advantage of this one-time opportunity to move their customers to a higher recurring revenue base, and I think they're really focused on that opportunity right now. Unidentified Analyst Got it. Just a follow up question, you mentioned above the smaller customers having an issue with the subscription plan and you're working with them. Could you elaborate the feedback they received on potential price increases that could happen post fiscal '20? Are there any pushbacks on that or what the strategy there? Andrew Anagnost Like I said, the feedback the negative feedback we've got was exactly what we've expected. When you announce to a customer that their maintenance prices are going up over a three-year period. You expect to get some feedback that's not necessarily positive. It has primarily been from the smaller customers and when you look at their main issue, it's doesn’t come down to maintenance versus subscription. They recognize that the program we've put in place puts reasonable price increases for them and they get they love the royalty program. What they are worried about is giving up their perpetual license. So what we are just we're just next year and the by the way it is over this next year. Because they're obviously going to renew at a 5% increase is essentially show the customers that they need small accounts, that moving to a subscription is a more valuable path for them and something that helps them accomplish what they need to do more effectively. We're committed to doing that and that's really going to be the essence of our response to these customers is delivering the value they're expecting to see and helping them understand exactly what they get when they move to subscription.  Amarpreet Hanspal Well I think one thing you noticed in talking to our partners. when we first announced this program and like got a much of reaction And then as our customers started talking to our partners. I mean a lot of that concern has started to going down, because of all the thing that Andrew said, that our customers are starting to understand better, the value proposition or subscription and kind of pricing one that we're putting in. And so I think that there was a little bit of component, we maybe an upstream, but that is really starting to new and customers are much more comfortable with the path that we have put forward. Unidentified Analyst If I may just ask one more, this as a follow-up to that. Is there any difference in the geography versus U.S. versus Europe versus Asia is there any difference and how customers reacted? Andrew Anagnost No. The reactions fairly uniformed. I mean, obviously you get some smaller variations, but it’s really uniform and it’s very similar to the reaction we got when we announced the end of perpetual. So it’s playing out exactly the same way and we’re going to go to the exact in process. But there is no particular geography or country that show any propensity to be concerned. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities. Steve Koenig I’m going to turn to bunch the two questions maybe at ones, because they're kind of related. So I guess first, to what extent are your plans for the discount that you'll offer on subscriptions done at the M2S program next year and the year after. Are those pretty much hard wire or might you change those? And kind of the related question is, I understand you’re not prepared to give the guide yet on the M2S program, the volumes that you will get out of the M2S program and that sensible that you’re not ready yet to do that. But to what extent -- can you give us color on to what extent to your fiscal ’20 targets depend on the price increases that you will effectively get from the maintenance customers and the converting customers? Andrew Anagnost So I’m going to answer part of that and then I’m going to let Scott speak to the other part of it. So with regard to the maintenance subscription program, look we’ve rolled out the program. We created visibility, we’ve told them, they’re getting a 60% discount, that discount goes down by 5% every year as they -- depending on what year they move. It’s our intend to stick to that program and stick to that program, we think it’s an excellent program, it's an excellent level of discount. There is really no reason to change that. So I don’t anticipate any change in the actual rules of the program. Scott Herren Yes. I hear you that Steve. And so your second question, there is interesting effect, if you look at the price increases filled into maintenance to subscription. The longest someone stays on maintenance, of course they incur higher price increases, the more they contribute to ARR. So there is a bit of a reverse, it’s a big counter inclusive. There is no dependency on a very rapid shift over, in fact the slower it goes actually boost ARR a bit as it moves along. So there is no significant dependency model on that. Steve Koenig May I clarity than Scott. Have you assumed in your long-term guide, a rapid, fairly rapid shift over, so there is fairly minimal price boost, or there is the long-term guidance require that significant number of customers stay on maintenance. Scott Herren Yes. Our long-term targets do assume that it shifts over and that the majority do shift over, but I don’t want to get into any of the details on what that looks like, I said there is an interesting play in terms of the rate and pace, that they move in the effective house [ph] in the model. As with most of the metrics in the models, Steve, we try to be somewhat conservative on those. Andrew Anagnost We have a clear goal to get as much of that maintenance phase moved over to subscription by FY '20 as we possibly can.  Steve Koenig Sounds good. Thank you.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Ken Talanian So you had a nice down tick in expenses in this quarter, and I was wondering if you could walk us through some of your key initiatives to continue to contain expenses. What elements might cause you to perform better than your current guidance on that front? Scott Herren Sure just to be clear, we typically always see a sequential down tick in spend from Q4 to Q1. Q4, as yearend, there is a lot of the true ups that happened on variable compensation plans on commissions. It’s a quarter that we have our AU events which also drives our expense. So the normal seasonality you'd expect to decline from Q4 to Q1, the rate of that decline in some ways depends on how successful we were in the prior year because submissions are not an insignificant part of that decline. So it's not a -- while it is a sequential decline and it's not unexpected sequential decline from Q4 to Q1. Amar if you want to touch on how we're managing spend? Amarpreet Hanspal So Ken, what I'd add is that outlook for the year on spend is being unchanged because we've instituted operational rigor and discipline and continue to make very hard choices in investing in the right areas to drive the transition and divest in sort of non-core projects and non-core activities and just keep a tight focus on managing spends. So our outlook for the year is unchanged and I think we're making all the right decisions in terms of ensuring that the transition remains on track. And some of the things like we decided to divest, we had a bunch of consumer products for example last year, that are not material to the transition we make choices like volume [ph] divest, and that's giving us some of the fuel we need to keep driving the transition forward. Ken Talanian Okay, great. And there is a follow up, I realized it's early, but could you give us a sense to how to think about what the price increase is might look like in the years following the initial three-year subscription discount that folks will be locking in? Will it mean -- directionally could you expect it be on par with the subscription price, absent that discount or might it even be more? Scott Herren Ken, we've been very explicit at the program where the customer pops up to the terminal discount price of the program. So the main subscription program lasts three years, and at the end of that third year, there is a particular discount. That's the price that everybody trues up to when they exit the program. Which by the way is the right thing to do with regard to incenting the customer to not only give up their perpetual license, but feel comfortable with the move to subscription. Ken Talanian Okay. And is that for EBAs as well or just product in collections? Scott Herren EBAs are a totally different process. So when customer moves to EBA, they've moved off of maintenance to a consumption model. Remember, when you go for all of these things, with regards to the way we've rolled out the prices, the way we manage the price increases at the terminal point. Our goal is to maximize the value of that maintenance base and that is all about minimizing the churn out of those customers during that base. We feel like we've created a program that balances both the price uplift and the churn factors that guide us and maximizing the value of that base, that's what's driving all of this.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest. Monika Garg  I guess first question, one which we get quite often is that. Looking at it, it seems like a low gross market, but your target of 20% subscription growth means, you need to add somewhere between 850,000 to 900,000 new subscriptions ever year. So can you maybe walk through the math to achieve that? Andrew Anagnost Yes. There is a fundamental thing we've been telling the people over and over again with regards to how this [technical difficulty]. First off, the move to subscription is reset the price points for design software pretty dramatically. So what we’re seeing is, we’re seeing increased demand for our offering, just by virtue of the fact that upfront costs are some much lower. Then there is a couple of other factors that play out here in terms of hitting those long-term subscription targets. One is the non-subscriber base we’ve been talking about over and over again throughout the last few years, those customers are moving forward. The other, which is a 2 million plus based of people. The other base is the 12 million pirate based that is going that move from pirated software to subscriptions, we know, we understand that base, we know they're moving forward. But the more important factor as we look over a five-year period. Is the market expansion, we’re going to see with the delivery of the cloud applications in both construction and manufacturing. The move to the cloud, especially in the manufacturing space starting to share shift away from our competitors to our offerings. When you add all of those things together, the 20% of subscription growth target is quite achievable and is achievable not only from growing off our existing core, but expanding into these new markets in construction and manufacturing.  Amarpreet Hanspal Monika, I just [indiscernible], we’ve always been the volume leader in the industries that serve and we continue to do that, we continue to drive as Andrew said share shift now increasingly manufacturing from traditional CADscan [ph] systems over to new cloud based disruptive system like Fusion and with the adoption of construction solutions they all expand our opportunity. And so in combination with the [indiscernible] compliance, with legacy opportunity and just the organic volume we see through job growth in the industries, I think we feel, we remain confident in our goals that we set ourselves. Monika Garg  Perfect. Thanks. And then as a follow-up. Could you share the split of subscription between EBAs, cloud and product subs? Thank you. Andrew Anagnost The one, so I could say we don’t give it at that level of granularity, the one number we have shared is the number of EBA subscription in this quarter was 44,000. And that’s really -- we sold above EBAs [ph] in Q4, you watched how they get used and adopted, or how many uses in those accounts adopt are EBA solutions and then sort of 90 days later we count the subscription. So that number was 44,000. At this point we’re not prepared to breakout cloud and product subs. But look as we’ve said, our strategy is working, our business monetization, platform transition is working, subscription is working everywhere. So we saw strength across all of those subscription types. Monika Garg  Thank you so much. Operator  Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn things back over David Gennarelli for any closing comments. David Gennarelli Thanks, operator. We’ll be at the JP Morgan conference in Boston next Tuesday and the Canaccord one-on-one conference in Toronto next Thursday. We’ll be at the Berenberg and the NASDAQ conferences in London on June 14th and 15th respectively.

My name is Crystal, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I\'d like to welcome everyone to ADP\'s Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded, and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you, Crystal, and good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP\'s Vice President, Investor Relations. I\'m here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP\'s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jan Siegmund, ADP\'s Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. I\'d like to remind everyone that today\'s call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current excitations. Now, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. Today, we released our third quarter fiscal 2017 results, with reported revenue growth of 5% to $3.4 billion. This revenue growth includes about 1 percentage point of pressure from the second quarter disposition of our spending accounts in COBRA businesses. Our diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.31. Jan will take you through the key contributing factors to our performance in more detail shortly. Our new business bookings this quarter declined by 7%, as we continued to overcome the strong fiscal 2016 sales of solutions that assist our clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act. I\'d like to remind you that the Affordable Care Act factor was quite unique and that it helped accelerate various buying decisions across our mid- and upmarkets, both from new client share and our existing base. Nevertheless, our pipeline of HCM opportunities continues to be strong, as we leverage our investments in our strategic cloud platforms, Vantage and Workforce Now. Now, let me discuss client retention. As we reported, retention declined 170 basis points for the quarter. The losses that contributed to this decline were concentrated on our legacy platforms, and we believe some of these losses were triggered by our upgrade activities in the mid- and upmarket. We maintain our core belief that these migrations are the right thing to do for our clients as well as for ADP. Our midmarket migrations are anticipated to be completed by the end of this calendar year, while the migration efforts upmarket will be phased in over time in partnership with our clients. Client satisfaction and retention remains high on our strategic platforms, and we are seeing that with our midmarket Workforce Now platform. The feedback from clients on this platform has been positive. In fact, a report from G2 Crowd, a leading business solutions review platform, recently added ADP Workforce Now to its Best Software 2017 list in the Core HR category. This list is based exclusively on feedback from users of the product. We ranked highest for ease-of-use, quality of support, which is especially gratifying given our focus on service and the user experience. ADP\'s success over the past 68 years is tied to our ability to keep pace with our clients\' evolving needs across economic cycles. As our recent workforce vitality report indicated, the labor market continues to be robust, and we see our clients becoming increasingly focused on talent, finding, retaining and engaging critical staff in a much more competitive environment. Our recent acquisition of the Marcus Buckingham Company, which we completed in the third quarter, is an example of our commitment to assist clients in meeting their talent needs. When it comes to talent and performance management, we know the needs of each client and each team are unique. By adding TMBC\'s content, coaching and technology solutions to the ADP portfolio, we now offer a suite of proven products to help leaders unleash the talent of their teams and create value for our clients. We\'ve talked before about our focus on the user experience and delivering solutions that our clients and their employees find easier and more intuitive to use. We\'ve applied that same thinking to our channel partners with the introduction of ADP Accountant Connect. We\'re particularly proud of the continued strength and robust growth of our downmarket, where we now have over 500,000 clients on our RUN platform. And this unique solution provides our accountant channel partners with a unified view of payroll as well as reporting and tax information for all our shared clients. This solution was developed in collaboration with our accountant channel partners to meet their needs and has already been recognized by Accountant Today (sic) [Accounting Today] (5:41) as one its 2017 top new products in the accountant resources category. We believe solutions like ADP Accountant Connect will help further enhance our relationships with this important referral channel while creating a better experience for our shared clients. We are also pleased to recently receive recognition from NelsonHall, a global BPO analyst firm, who identified ADP as a leader in payroll services for the fourth consecutive year. In naming us a leader, the NelsonHall report highlighted our global reach and the breadth of our service offering, allowing clients ranging from small businesses to global enterprises to choose how much expertise they wish to retain in-house or to outsource. In its report, NelsonHall also recognized ADP\'s ability to help clients benchmark their workforce metrics against industry averages using the ADP data cloud. And they also recognize the ADP Marketplace, which helps clients access an ecosystem of enterprise applications from ADP and our partners to extend the value of their HCM solutions. It\'s great to be recognized in the industry, but it\'s also great when we see our company recognized more broadly, which is why I was especially proud to see Fortune magazine name us to their Most Admired Companies\' list for the 11th time and rank us number one in our category for the fifth straight time. I\'m particularly proud of this because it\'s a testament to the confidence our stakeholders place in us and to the continued dedication of our 57,000 associates. In closing, despite the pressure on new business bookings and retention, we remain confident in the enduring qualities of our business. We are pleased with the continued strong performance of our PEO and multinational solutions and with our improving service metrics within the midmarket. We are especially pleased with our success in the downmarket, which continues to demonstrate the value of our strategy to deliver great technology and great service. We are confident that this strategy is the right one to help our clients succeed, which will in turn drive sustained growth for ADP. With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our third quarter results and an update on the fiscal 2017 outlook. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. ADP revenues for the quarter grew 5% on a reported basis, 6% organic. Our revenue growth this quarter experienced pressure as we began to lap our fiscal year 2016 ACA-related revenues. Pre-tax earnings from continuing operations before taxes grew 4% on a reported basis to $828 million, despite almost 2 percentage points of combined pressure from our second quarter business disposition and our fiscal year 2017 acquisitions. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 4%. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 20 basis points, compared to 24.8% in last year\'s third quarter. Our margins this quarter were impacted by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations cost related to our service alignment initiative. Our net earnings grew 10% on a reported basis to $588 million and benefited from a lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate this quarter was aided by an incremental tax benefit related to prior period software development efforts, $0.04 of which was not previously anticipated and $0.02 tax benefit related to the adoption of new stock-based compensation accounting guidance. Diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.31 and benefited from fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Our new business bookings performance this quarter was disappointing. However, we have continued to make investments into our sales organization to better position us for growth. We\'re confident in the competitiveness of our portfolio and the strength of our distribution capabilities, and in turn, our ability to execute on our pipeline of market opportunities. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 2% on a reported basis for the quarter and included 1 percentage points of pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses earlier this fiscal year. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.5% in the third quarter. Average client fund balances grew 2% on a reported basis, or 3% on a constant dollar basis compared to a year ago. As a result of improving employment, we have continued to see pressure from lower state unemployment insurance collections impact client fund balances. This pressure was offset by a combination of wage inflation and growth in our pays per control metric. Employer Services margin decreased about 40 basis points in the quarter. This decrease was driven by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations related to our service alignment initiative. PEO revenues grew 12% in the quarter with average worksite employees growing 12% to 471,000. The PEO continued to experience slowing growth in the benefit pass-through costs, resulting from lower health care renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation of our worksite employees during the quarter. The PEO margins continued to expand through operational efficiencies, which helped drive approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. New business bookings this quarter were down 7%. And as a result, we now expect new business bookings for fiscal year 2017 to decline about 5% to 7% compared to the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We have also updated certain other elements of our fiscal 2017 forecast, which I will now take you through. Despite our revised new business bookings guidance and this quarter\'s revenue retention decline, our revenue outlook remains unchanged at about 6%. This forecast continues to include 1 percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impacts from foreign currency. While Employer Services segment consistent with our prior forecast, revenue growth is anticipated to be 3% to 4%, which continues to include 1 percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impacts from foreign currency. For the PEO, ADP continues to anticipate revenue growth of 13%. We continue to expect our consolidated adjusted EBIT margin expansion to be about 50 basis points, which includes about 20 basis points of pressure from dual operations pertaining to our service alignment initiative, which was not part of our non-GAAP charges. On a segment level, we continue to anticipate margin expansion in Employer Services of 25 basis points to 50 basis points. For the PEO, we expect continued operating efficiencies and slower growth in our pass-through revenues as compared to fiscal year 2016 to help drive margin expansion on a full year basis. Accordingly, we continue to expect fiscal year 2017 PEO margin expansion of at least 100 basis points. We are also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to increase to about $20 million compared with our prior forecasted increase of about $15 million. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to be up about $15 million compared to the prior forecast of about $10 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. As a result of the software development related tax benefit, some of which was not previously contemplated in our prior guidance and the additional benefit related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, we now estimate our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 to be 31.4% as compared to our prior forecasted rate of 32.4%. Based upon our revision of our effective tax rate guidance; adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 13% to 14% compared to our prior forecast of 11% to 13%. Our forecast also continues to contemplate a return of excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases of $1.2 billion to $1. 4 billion, subject to market conditions during fiscal year 2017. This forecast includes any repurchases required to offset dilution related to employee benefit plans. So, with that, I will turn the call back to our operator to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We will take our first question from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. Good morning. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good morning. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Last quarter – I\'m thinking of it as the December quarter – you showed an improvement in client retention, I believe, 10 basis points; in this quarter, the March quarter, down 170 basis points. What was the major change between the December quarter and the March quarter that led to that decline in client revenue retention? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think as we mentioned, I think, in our opening comments, it was concentrated in our legacy platforms in the midmarket and in the upmarket. It was particularly skewed towards the upmarket this quarter. Some of the losses, as you know, we don\'t provide guidance. And in the December quarter, we wouldn\'t have talked about forward-looking retention. But some of the deterioration that we experienced in the quarter was anticipated as a result of some known large losses. We typically have reasonable amount of visibility, sometimes several quarters, if not a year or more, for very large clients when they are moving off of one of our solutions. But I guess the core message we are trying to deliver in our comments is that it continues to be concentrated in our legacy platforms. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. And just as a quick follow-up, it would seem that the decline in new bookings this year and some of the pressure on client revenue retention would be more consequential for fiscal 2018 given the way your revenue model works. Can you give us some preliminary thoughts about fiscal 2018 based on the retention trends and the booking trends you\'re seeing in FY 2017? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think you\'re right about the way the math works for our business. And I think that\'s why Jan was very clear in kind of reaffirming our guidance for, obviously, the rest of the year, because we\'re so far into the year that these variations and retention in sales have very low impact on the current next quarter and even maybe one quarter after that. But clearly, going forward, for the next fiscal year, it does roll into the math in terms of that waterfall chart that we\'ve shared with you. As you know, we don\'t provide guidance for fiscal year 2018 until our August call. So we\'re really in the middle of our operating plan process and we\'ll obviously have better information then in terms of how that waterfall chart exactly falls through in terms of the various factors that impact our revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that\'s true. But, David, you\'re mathematically correct that our new business bookings get implemented and turn into revenue after six months approximately and so some of the impact of our lower retention and lower sales will be seen in the revenue growth next year, as you roll it forward. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just the first one, if I heard you correctly, it sounded like the midmarket client migrations have been pushed out by two quarters. The question, I guess, is why have you pushed that out? And then expanding on that a little bit further, as you\'re starting, it sounds like with the upmarket – how has what you\'ve seen in midmarket colored your expectations and how you are going to approach the upmarket? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think, you\'re right about the timing that we were hoping that we would be done. I think our wording was that we would be done somewhere around the end of this fiscal year. And so, now we\'re saying by the end of the calendar year. Realistically, we really don\'t do migrations in November and December because we have year-end and a lot of activities going on. So it\'s really a few months and its a few clients or a few thousand clients, because in the midmarket, we\'re talking about clients in the thousands. And just as a reminder, there were tens of thousands. I think the total number of client migrations was somewhere around 50,000 or 60,000 clients. And so what we\'re talking about is, I would say, a couple of thousand stragglers that we felt, in order to just meet an artificial deadline wasn\'t worth. We learned our lesson, I think, a year-and-a-half ago around when we had to accelerate, in some cases we were forced to accelerate migrations as a result of ACA to get clients on our new platform in order to be able to give them that solution. We learned through that process that you want to really truly upgrade the clients and have them feel that it\'s an upgrade, not a forced march or a negative experience. And so we\'re just focused on making sure that it\'s the right kind of experience and we felt like a couple of thousand clients falling over from one fiscal year to the other is really not that big of a deal in our minds. And I think it\'s the right thing to do. And I think, to answer your question about how that experience colors our approach in the upmarket, again, I think we learned some lessons in terms of making sure that we do things at the proper pace, and that we do it in partnership with our clients. And I think that becomes much more important in the upmarket where it\'s much more complex, and clients have, in many cases, provide a lot of their own internal resources in order to make a migration happen. In the small market, when we did those migrations, there was very little effort and very little need for clients to be involved. In the midmarket, there was a little bit more effort and a little more involvement by the clients. And in the upmarket, there\'s quite a lot of involvement. And hence, it has to be much more carefully planned and, hence, you\'re probably hearing from us that it\'s going to be a longer process in terms of getting those upgrades completed. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Then just a follow-up, as you\'ve had a little more time in the new service delivery geographies, how was the ability to find talent then? How is it compared to your expectations for shifting to those locations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think it\'s fair to say that we are – and again, we\'re early in our goals here. But really, we\'re on track. So we\'re actually quite pleased. We\'ve got several thousand people already hired in our new locations in Orlando, in Maitland, which is near Orlando; in Norfolk, Virginia; and we\'re already hiring also in Tempe. And it is in addition to Augusta and El Paso where we already had two strategic locations. And we have a couple of other key locations, but those are the ones that we\'ve been talking the most about regarding our strategic alignment initiative. So I\'d say we\'re pleased with the talent, we\'re pleased with the pace. I think we\'re on plan in terms of the number of people we were intending to hire. We\'re on plan in terms of the wage levels and the quality of the talent. I have obviously visited, and I think Jan, we\'ve all visited these locations. In fact, we had a very large associate town hall meeting in our Norfolk, Virginia location. And it may be a honeymoon phase but it\'s an incredibly energetic environment. People are very positive and very bullish on ADP. I think we\'re considered a great employer in the markets that we are entering. And we\'ve got a lot of help from other parts of the organization getting these folks trained and ready to be able to actually deliver service, and in some cases they obviously already are. And that\'s why we have some of these dual operations cost that Jan has referred to a couple of times, because we\'re trying to make sure that we do this in a very careful and methodical way. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning. Thanks as always for all the disclosure. Just a couple of questions. Just on the pricing front, on successfully migrating clients to the new strategic platforms, any surprises there? Did that contribute at all to the bookings forecast? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just to be clear, when we migrate our clients, the migration itself is not counting as a new business booking because business bookings account only incremental recurring revenue that we report. So the migration is generally cost-neutral to our clients, and they have enhanced feature functionality with a new product that they get. In the process, clients continue to make buying decisions and buy incremental modules as they do, and we have seen that trend continue in particular in the midmarket. But the actual migration is revenue-neutral, as we approach it, and that will be the same for all upmarket clients. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Thanks for that clarification. I wasn\'t sure if the change might get captured in the (24:26) business bookings. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. So the change – if a client buys more, I don\'t have the most recent statistics here, but I think the trends continue that a number of clients purchases incremental modules as they see the power of the integrated platform. And so there is some slight revenue uptick that we do see for the clients who choose it and only that incremental revenue would be reflected. But it would be immaterial for the new business bookings number in total. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. One more quick follow-up. I know Jan because you\'ve been sort of, I guess, signaling or suggesting that some of these things could happen with ACA. But I\'m just curious, just looking back now, is some of the reduction in this bookings outlook – is there a way to quantify how much might be related to the weak follow-through on ACA module sales and the related tough comp on ACA modules versus maybe a pull-forward of broader payroll HCM sales related to ACA? Do you follow my question? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I do. And I think that it is – as I think we\'ve been trying to signal for, I think, probably three years if you go back to my notes, it\'s very hard because we\'re obviously in uncharted territories, because we were in something completely new. And it was a very comprehensive regulatory framework that required a lot of information from HR platforms, payroll platforms, benefit platforms, et cetera. And when you look back, we had two years of more than 12% new business bookings growth. And this is why we were cautious all along because that is a little strong. We were happy with it and we take it. It\'s good for our shareholders. It\'s good for ADP. It\'s good for our revenues. But it definitely felt like a fairly significant tailwind. And I think, in hindsight, it was obviously a big tailwind. Now, what has now added, I think, potentially to that pressure, which again we can\'t quantify scientifically is that we have, I think, a different environment politically that\'s creating some uncertainty, that certainly has impacted our new business bookings. We just can\'t put our finger on exactly to what extent. So as an example, we knew we had a grow-over issue just for ACA itself because we had already sold 50% of our addressable client base. But we did have some planned sales of ACA this year. And even though we\'ve gotten some, it\'s significantly lower than plan, which is not surprising given the headlines and the frequent votes on repeal and replace of ACA. And so I think that\'s a second factor that I think was not certainly anticipated as we entered into this fiscal year in terms of our planning process. We knew we had to grow over the mathematical grow-over issue. Now we have what I would call the political issue. And then the third one that you mentioned, which again, is very hard for us to put our finger on, but I think you\'re onto something because we experienced the same thing back when we had the Y2K phenomenon in year 2000, where you do have some amount of pull forward, if you will, of business because we\'ve seen this particularly on some of our wins last year from ERPs were quite high and elevated. And I think some of that, it appears, with the benefit of hindsight is, people on kind of older legacy technology trying to find a new solution for ACA. And by the way, some of that happened to us. So as we mentioned, before we think some of our retention issues last year may have been related to the same factor of people kind of just out looking for new solutions as a result of what I would call an event, which is a significant event called ACA. So I think all three things are a factor. We really wish we could put our finger on exactly how much each one is accountable. But unfortunately, we can\'t. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. Thanks so much for the insights. It\'s helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to follow-up on the prior question. On the new bookings weakness you\'re seeing and specifically the revision to guidance. Obviously, going from flat to down 5% for the full year. I think you had talked the last quarter about seeing confidence in improving bookings rates as you head through the end of the year. I guess, maybe you could talk anecdotally about what changed from three months ago to today in terms of specific client conversations you\'re having, is it simply the regulatory environment, uncertainty, seizing things up in terms of purchasing decisions? And then if you got any color on what clients are telling you about what they have to see to get more confidence to book? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think that a couple of comments and maybe Jan can add in terms of his observations. We\'ve obviously been meeting frequently with our sales leaders, and I\'ve been going around sales meetings trying to get to put my finger on the pulse. And it doesn\'t appear that it\'s the economy, because we have very robust and strong results in our downmarket. Our PEO is still doing well. Our MNC business had a great quarter. A lot of the channels that we sell through small business like our Insurance Services products and our Retirement Services products are also doing quite well. So it\'s really not an across-the-board weakness. It does appear to be concentrated in places where we had the ACA phenomenon, if you will. And then how much of it is related to just the grow-over itself versus uncertainty about the political environment, and the fact that the people maybe are sitting and waiting. We do have some information around our pipeline, which is not the same as bookings. So bookings are bookings, and we are very clear about how we count revenues. And I think Jan just went through the math. But we do have pipeline reports like any sales force would have pipeline reports. And in our midmarket and our upmarket, we feel pretty good like we did last quarter about our pipeline. So if we say we feel pretty good and the sales are not materializing, that can only lead to only one conclusion, which is the decision-making is getting elongated or slowing. And we can\'t quite put our finger on why, but that\'s exactly the math is showing versus our pipeline right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think the only thing, Jim, just keep in mind our new guidance is down 5% to 7%, is our expected new business bookings guidance and I think Carlos captured it. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Understand. And then maybe as a follow-up. Can you maybe just talk about the regulatory environment changes and what impact that could have on the PEO business? And specifically, what\'s your confidence level in that PEO business kind of sustaining double-digit growth for the foreseeable future? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good question. Actually, let me finish also. I think you mentioned about like tone in the sales force. And one of the kind of surprising things for me at least is the tone in the sales force is still very positive. Like, we\'ve done some things to try to "encourage people not to throw in the towel" because this is another factor that I have to worry about, right, that we are close to our end of our fiscal year, and the way our incentive systems work, there\'s a big incentive when you\'re exceeding plan to over exceed it. And, likewise, there\'s a bit of an incentive to throw in the towel, if you will, if you\'re having a bad year. So we\'ve done some things to try to – and that may be why the sales forces still remains upbeat, or maybe because they think these issues are transitory. It\'s very, again, hard to put a scientific answer on it. But it feels positive in terms of the tone in the sales force. On the question about PEO and the regulatory environment, I think I mentioned multiple times also in the PEO over the last couple of years that it felt like we were getting some tailwind as a result of ACA, if for no other reason because it was creating conversation opportunities, right. Because people are looking for a solution and they\'re looking at maybe different alternatives and someone is able to talk to them about the PEO, and I think it\'s compelling value proposition they\'re able to close the business. So I would put the PEO in the same category that we were watching, if you will. It\'s not quite the same in the sense that many of the clients in the PEO are not necessarily buying only ACA. And we\'re not rushing to make a decision of that magnitude only because of ACA. So I think there\'s a subtle but important difference. So I\'m not convinced and we certainly aren\'t seeing it in the numbers yet that the PEO will have the same kind of difficulties, if you will, growing over. But it\'s definitely a more difficult sales environment for the PEO. But having said that, just again we\'ve said this multiple times that the PEO has grown double-digits for, I think, its 17 years now. And so it\'s just a very compelling value proposition. And if, for example, there are changes in the regulatory landscape, some parts of our business may be affected like our direct ACA product, if the entire thing gets repealed and the whole thing goes away, that would not be good news for that part of the business. But, as we know now from what we\'re hearing of what\'s growing through Congress, there\'s not going to be a complete repeal. There\'s going to be some kind of new framework. Those types of new frameworks are always good for the PEO because they intend to be more state-based regulation, which is what the PEO is really good at and what small companies are not very good at in having to deal with. And so I think that I would remain generally optimistic and positive – more optimistic and more positive about the PEO. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is open. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first, just wanted to start off, I know you just touched on this a little bit, but a little more color would be helpful. I mean, I understand why businesses are holding off with regards to ACA solutions, just given the uncertainties that you mentioned around healthcare in the U.S. as a whole. But at the end of the day, the law is the law, right. So kind of like at what point, if reform keeps being delayed, do you think employers will start to demand the solutions you\'re offering around ACA and just make other buying decisions in general that they may have been holding off because of the uncertainty? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We were hoping that that would happen two weeks ago or three weeks ago when President said that he was done with it and that we\'re moving on to tax reform. And unfortunately, that was not – it appears not to have been the case. So I think we\'re watching the same news you\'re watching. We do have obviously some access to and some information that we get from people in Washington about what\'s happening on the Hill and the regulation and so forth. But we have kind of similar information to what everyone else has. And these things always, when you\'re in the middle of them, feel like your feet are in cement. And that\'s how it feels like to us right now. It\'s very frustrating but these things pass. We will look back a year or two from now and there will either be the existing ACA or some other version or some more complicated state regime or complex regulatory framework at the state level. And we\'ll hopefully be looking back and seeing this as yet another opportunity for ADP to shine and to help our clients. But right now, it is what it is, and it doesn\'t feel great. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Thanks. And then just to follow up, when you think about the slide that you guys put out, just your long-term growth driver, the 7% to 9% that you think of the longer term and I think you have like a 14% to 15% new business bookings and 7% to 8% reduction from client losses. Just how does that math change given the bookings guidance that you\'re seeing right now? And I know 2018 is a little early, but just any color you can give us on how to think about how that 7% to 9% growth might be impacted for fiscal 2018? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. Our longer-term expectations for organic growth is 7% to 9%, as you correctly quoted. And it\'s driven by growth of new business bookings in the range of 8% to 10% growth. And it always was meant to cover multiple year type of cycle elongated and it was not a commitment obviously, as you see realistically – not a commitment to perform every single fiscal year. So we are not updating our long-term growth outlook at this point in time. But, clearly, our new business bookings have fallen a little bit behind, but relative to a three- or four-year cycle of new business bookings, we still feel good about our growth opportunities. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just want to understand the bookings a little bit more. So a two-part question, part math, part more subjective. So the math is just to get the full-year guidance. Seems like you\'re implying potentially further deterioration in the fourth quarter, unless maybe the weighting from the third quarter is disproportionate, so maybe some clarification there. And then the second part of that is maybe you can just talk about the cadence exiting the selling season and into April? Carlos, you already talked a little bit about hoping to see some change as of two weeks ago but not seeing it but maybe just a little bit more color. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think you\'re right that the third quarter is disproportionate. So we have a lot of – disproportionate number of dollar sales in the third quarter compared to the entire year. And that\'s just the way the seasonality has always worked. So the fourth quarter would not be materially different in terms of the momentum or this kind of the 5% to 7% down range. It\'s in that ballpark. So there is really no real news I think there. I think the cadence in terms of the exit for the – the one thing that we\'re grappling with is, obviously, we have the realities, right, of the political environment and we\'re hoping that there will be resolution here relatively soon. Our fiscal year, obviously, starts on July 1. We\'re hoping to have some kind of – we thought two, three weeks ago, we had clarity. So we\'re hoping that we get that behind us and we get some clarity, because we have lots of other products. We have lots of other parts of our business that are performing well. And we just want to get on with it, right, and be able to continue to sell the other suite of products that we have available both in the midmarket and also in the upmarket. So I think, as I mentioned before, it feels like exiting the year, our pipelines are robust. It feels like the tone and the confidence in the sales force is high. But the results are the results. And I think Jan and I live in a world of reality, not in the world of make-believe. And so we\'re being cautious and careful, but it\'s hard not to be optimistic because the economy is picking up it feels like. The labor markets are tightening. And we have some very compelling value propositions in that kind of environment where employers now are going to be "engaging" in a war for talent again, which we haven\'t seen. We forget that 10 years ago there was real issue in terms of finding people. And we benefited back then from that kind of environment in terms of our HCM solutions, and we\'re hoping that we\'re entering a period here where all of our solutions, the entire suite becomes very compelling as clients become focused on attracting people and holding onto the people that they have. And we see all kinds of metrics in our own numbers and in the government data around higher voluntary turnover, higher wage growth, lots of signals that the labor markets are tightening. And I think our value propositions are very compelling in that kind of environment. So we just want to get this uncertainty and these delays and this slow decision-making behind us so that we can get on to the business. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe just... Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ...a little comment to this on the outlook, which Carlos described correctly kind of roughly in line with fourth quarter and the full-year guidance. But we\'ll also continue to put our dollars where our statements are and the investments into the sales force, the incentives that we\'re bringing out to get the sales force ready, and the hiring and preparing for growth in the next year are actually fully underway and have actually to some degree impacted our third quarter and fourth quarter results because we believe we have that opportunity going forward. So we\'re preparing for growth in the future. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. And then just a question on retention. I just wanted to clarify. So it sounded like some of the higher attrition was in the upmarket and was partly related to migration. But at the same time, you\'re taking a more measured pace with your migration relative to what you do with Workforce Now. So just trying to square that and see maybe where any surprises came versus expectations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Maybe one is connected to the other and maybe not. Because I think the reality is that the variability and I think we\'re very sensitive now obviously to retention for all the right reasons because we went through a really difficult last year, but we\'ve had variability in our retention forever at ADP because it\'s a different metric than our other metrics and it can be volatile. And as an example, in the upmarket, you can have one or two large clients that can actually move that number – one or two clients in the upmarket that can move the number for the upmarket and for ADP. And you saw a little bit of that in the first quarter where we lost that large government contract and the business that we ended up selling or were in the process of selling that had a material impact on our overall retention for the first quarter. So this wasn\'t one large client like that, but it was a handful of clients. And so our upmarket business is a little less than 20% of our overall revenue, so just to kind of put things in context and it\'s 2,000 to 3,000 clients. And a couple, literally, three, four client losses in a particular quarter can really move the number. So I was just trying to help kind of frame the discussion because at least for now I\'m not ready to conceive that we have a permanent – we don\'t talk about forward guidance on retention, but this is a third quarter issue for now. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. All right. One more on the topic of the day, retention. So the upmarket dynamic you\'re describing, I guess, does feel like it\'s a little bit new. Is there a change in the competitive landscape in the upmarket? Or is there anything you can identify that triggered I guess this handful of clients this quarter? Or is it just somewhat anomalous? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s a good question. And I think that you\'d be generally I think right that despite the fact that we do have volatility across quarters, we have generally not paid a lot of attention to it because over the course of kind of rolling 12 months or even in terms of years, calendar years or even fiscal years, our retention in the upmarket has been pretty stable. I mean it\'s a sticky business. It doesn\'t change a whole lot. So I\'d say this quarter was – I\'d say it\'s fair that it\'s a little bit anomalous. And I think the answer to your other part of question; we don\'t see it as being related to any change in the competitive environment. Now, as always, in two to three years or in two to three quarters, I may be singing a different tune, but we have a lot of data around the reasons for the losses, what platform the losses were on, were they new technology, old technology, and what types of product the client had. And I think when we put all that information together, which Jan and I, obviously, spent a lot of time anticipating this being one of the topics of the day, we\'ve spent a lot of time on this issue and looked at the names of the clients, who they are, what platforms they were on, and we don\'t see any change in the competitive environment. I think we\'ve said before that there isn\'t any one competitor that causes us a majority of our losses, and likewise there isn\'t any one competitor where we take the majority of our business from. It\'s spread out all over the landscape and it remains that way. For some of our competitors that might be different because of their size where they may have a heavy concentration of taking clients from one particular company. In our case, that is not the case. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe a tiny bit of further detail, Lisa, is when we look at our competitive position against this multitude of competitors in the quarter, some competitive positions have improved and some have not. And that is a fairly typical thing we see each of these competitors evolving quarter-by-quarter up and down. So when we say the general competitive dynamic we feel has not changed, it\'s rooted in this analysis, and we see in some cases we have improved and some cases we have not. So it\'s a mixed bag obviously, but we believe it hasn\'t changed. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think I didn\'t maybe answer directly your question about how does this square with our upgrade or migrations strategy. And I think the things really are somewhat connected in maybe an odd way that we think that because we know what clients we lost and what platforms they were on that it makes it even more compelling for us to move our clients onto our newer technologies. On the other hand, we know that these movements are complex and that the clients need to help us and they need to be involved, they need to cooperate. And so finding the right clients in the right place at the right time is just different than it was in the midmarket and in the down market. But it think it heightens our confidence that it\'s the right thing to do over time. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. And then I guess the follow-up, as we\'ve been living with you through the Workforce Now migrations in the midmarket, I know you\'ve consistently said that the retention levels are higher on the migrated clients and so there\'s sort of this nirvana we are going to get to when the migrations are done where retention should naturally go back up. Are we though now facing a more protracted period in the upmarket kind of going to the same thing? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the nirvana, it does from what Jan and I were looking at just over the last couple of days, their retention rates on our current version Workforce Now strategic platform are extremely high, and we\'re very happy with them and we have a lot of volume on it already. So that feels like it worked out the way we had hoped and we had anticipated. And with now the down-market on our new strategic platform with potential rates that frankly have improved dramatically over the last couple years and with our Workforce Now migrations being completed by the end of this calendar year and with 20% of our base remaining in the upmarket, we\'re feeling good about where we are. But the answer to your question is, yes, we have a protracted migration effort in the upmarket. It\'s the right thing to do. We\'re going to do it, and we\'re going to do it as well as we can and as quickly as we can without causing damage and disruption to our clients. But we\'re in a very different position from where we were four or five years ago when we had 10% of our clients on our strategic platforms that are version-less in cloud where there is no further migration and there is no further disruption. So it\'s a very, very different place and it hasn\'t felt good getting here but it feels pretty good now. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. Maybe quickly just on a more positive note. I know you\'ve had the reporting and benchmarking modules out in the market now at least for a few months. How are they doing? How is the uptake? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s going well. Again, that\'s another one back to the discussion about what\'s happening with the labor markets and the economy in general. Those are products that are useful no matter what, but in the kind of environment that we\'re entering into like helping people make sure that they\'re paying people the right amounts, that they know where their turnover is in comparison to benchmarks, that type of information is very, very useful to an HR leader or to a CEO in making good people decisions on a go-forward basis. So that\'s another example of something that the conversations for the last two or three years were about ACA. I think the conversations for the next two or three years are going to be about what\'s happening with your workforce, what\'s the turnover rate, how are you paying people. And I think these benchmark and analytics tools are going to facilitate those discussions, and hopefully, those sales because those are conversation openers or starters in order to convince clients to come to our product suite, which is I think unique in a sense that it has these data and analytics benchmarks. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Terrific. Thank you. Thanks for all the transparency as usual. Operator Thank you. And our next question will come from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you so much. A few times you mentioned the uncertainty and you thought it might have dissipated a few weeks ago when we had a little bit more clarity on ACA. Is the client uncertainty and the elongated decision-making you think it\'s solely related to ACA issues? Are there just other things going on in the current environment that clients are worried about? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Again, I\'ll just say one more time. It\'s impossible for us. We don\'t really have like a chart that kind of follows that. So this is really more on intuition, and I\'ll let Jan comment as well. But it\'s not just ACA that\'s creating uncertainty. I think the administration has asked the Labor Department to review the overtime rules, for example, that were about to be issued. I think there were pay equity rules that were coming out around EEOC reporting that are now under review as well. The fiduciary rule, which was intended to go through the – which would have affected our Retirement Services business has also been put under review. And so I think there are pockets of uncertainty in addition to ACA. And some of them happened to be related to our core business, which is HCM. And so if you\'re selling, for example, an ERP suite, some of that uncertainty may not really affect that decision-making. But if we were involved in a sales process where you had a large hourly workforce and many of them – sorry, a large salaried workforce because of the new rules was going to now be hourly and those hours needed to be tracked and you needed to be in compliance with the FLSA, that sales cycle has probably been elongated as a client stops and goes back to focusing on whatever they were focusing on before that trigger event. So I think there are a few other things that are probably not helpful, but again, it\'s hard for us to put a specific measure on each one of them. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. I understand and I appreciate the color. And then just one, I guess, numbers or model-related question. When do we anniversary the bump in bookings from all the ACA-driven business? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, next fiscal year, we are clearly half – still a little bit of grow-over but not that material. So next year should be a clean year relative to the ACA-related grow-over. Just a further clarification, we have tried to illustrate this a few times. With the ACA core module that we have sold came off an incremental fuller bundled sales that particularly included benefit administration module. So the impact of the Affordable Care Act have been broader than the direct impact of the ACA-related sales, which makes it a little bit harder to predict. And as a consequence, our clients (54:35) typically provides ADP-wide about 50% of our incremental new business bookings, however, come from selling more to existing clients. And that dynamic has now changed because we have fuller bundles now in particular in the midmarket. And so we started to transition to drive new logo growth in the midmarket and those channels have to readjust a little bit as a consequence of the ACA surge that has driven a more complete bundle in particular in the midmarket. So that transition is still present obviously next year, but we feel that we have great strategies in place to replace basically that up-sell strategy with a more aggressive new logo sales. And as we have clarified, it is a disappointing quarter, but despite our down guidance for new business booking sale, it will still be our second highest sales year ever for ADP. So keep that in mind. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. This is actually Jay Hanna on for Gary today. Kind of going off that last comment, going forward, given the struggles with the client retention this quarter and the now expected decline in bookings, should we expect an even greater spend on sales force additions going forward? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, it\'s funny you should mention that, because I think Jan I think did address and I\'ll let him if he wants to give more detail, which we probably don\'t because we\'re not giving FY 2018 guidance yet. But we\'re definitely not taking our foot off of the accelerator. So we obviously could change our minds a quarter or two from now, but our position right now is I think we mentioned it in Jan\'s comments, we\'re maintaining our investments in service, implementation, et cetera. And in some cases we\'ve actually accelerated or increased some of our investments. And I think in the sales organization is a place where I would say we\'ve added expense. And the irony is that the underlying sales expense gets helped by weaker sales because our commissions are lower and so forth, but there\'s a lot of things that go into that sales expense bucket, including head count cost and commissions. And so it\'s safe to say that our commission expense and our variable expense is helping us from a cost standpoint. But instead of taking that all to the bottom line, we have chosen to invest because, again, we believe our story which is that nothing fundamentally has changed in the economy, which is typically what really affects ADP, which by the way affects us less than most because of the nature of our business model. But if we saw a recession coming or a slowdown coming, we would have to start thinking hard about our expense levels. And that\'s not where we are right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a quick reminder, as one of the advantages of ADP is that we serve such a broad range of segments and markets in the U.S. and globally and multinational, and so as we had our challenges in the mid and upmarket, we continue to perform tremendously in the down-market, in the PEO, multinational. So there\'s a broad range of products that are gaining share and really driving success. So obviously, in that balance, our investments into sales signal our confidence for ultimate success in distribution. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of product-related questions. With regards to the higher ratings in terms of the G2 for Workforce Now, at what point do you start pivoting from migration of existing clients to proactively selling Workforce Now to clients that aren\'t currently utilizing ADP at all in the midmarket? That\'s the first question. And then secondly, can you tell us where we are with regards to Vantage in terms of the optimization of that solution, and when you would feel really good about pushing that? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the answer on the Workforce Now question is, about three or four months ago because I think Jan just alluded to that that we\'ve kind of tilted our focus now more towards new logo growth and new share from kind of the traditional approach of – doesn\'t mean we won\'t take additional modules and incremental business. But this is a fairly significant change from a sales force mentality standpoint where we were for several years focused on upgrades and on incremental sales of other modules to the existing client base as we upgraded them combined with selling something called ACA, which to some extent was a significant tailwind. So we\'re moving into a different environment. Luckily, we have other tailwinds like great products like you just mentioned with Workforce Now, and we can see, for example, our client satisfaction scores improving. We can see our client retention scores on our strategic platform being very, very high, higher than we\'ve had overall for the midmarket historically. So there\'s a lot of positive signs that we want to step on the accelerator and proactively sell our solution just as you mentioned. And I think we kind of got that religion, if you will, I don\'t know four to six months ago. And we\'ve been retooling, right, in terms of – I think Jan alluded to channels. I think if we\'re going to go after incremental new logos, not just add-on business that requires channel partnerships. And I think there\'s a lot of effort underway to build the same kind of success we have in our downmarket now with our midmarket channel partners. And so, the answer is, we\'re on that and we believe that, that will get traction over time. On the question about Vantage, Vantage continues to do quite well. And there, again, our satisfaction scores, for implementation have improved dramatically over the last several quarters as we invested in that process of the implementation process. I think we have like almost 350 live clients, versus I think we were at 220 at the beginning of the fiscal year. We have I think 500 sold, so we have a decent pipeline that needs to be implemented. And I don\'t mean pipeline. Those are actually signed contracts, 500 signed contracts. And so, we feel pretty good about our Vantage platform. I think it compares really well and competes very well with our upmarket competitors. But you all see the same thing we see. It\'s a very competitive environment in the upmarket and there are a lot of solutions. But we like what we have, and I think we\'re competing very effectively. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. And next a quick follow-up. With regards to the dual service platforms, do you still think that by the end of calendar 2018 you\'ll have completed that transition to the new service platforms? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. You\'re never complete on operations, Mark, but the majority of our work is actually this fiscal year and next fiscal year. So in next fiscal year I\'d still anticipate some dual ops. We haven\'t determined what that will be specifically, but there is still transitioning happening, but the vast majority relative to those three new locations and the two existing ones should be completed in 2018. But our service strategy is obviously organic and evolving and we\'re going to continue to drive improvements, but 2018 is a big year still for us. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Just two quick clarifications. Just on the retention. Do we know where these clients are going? Are they bringing it in-house, the service? Just curious. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. The sources of our business and the sources of our losses is something that we track. And both have very similar dynamics. It\'s a fragmented and there\'s no clear trend to it, and so they go to a variety of different targets. Some in the ERP space, some to our traditional competitors, some to other solutions, so it is a wide range. Some is driven by their M&A activity, moving to on (1:03:41). So the loss reasons and their targets is varied as the sources of our businesses are varied and as a consequence we feel the competitive dynamic has not fundamentally changed as we observe it. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And we did look at that. I happened to look at it last night. I asked for a little more detail in terms of our upmarket losses and unfortunately I didn\'t compare the same "top losses" to last year third quarter top losses, but when we looked at this year\'s third quarter losses, there were a couple that went back in-house. That we\'re using, for example, our COS solution, which is our BPO solution upmarket, and I guess they decided to go back and rebuild internal capabilities and use their internal technology. But I think Jan described it well, because I mean we sound elusive when we give you that answer, but it\'s really all over the board. And maybe that\'s because of our size because again, and just to continue to emphasize some of our competitors would have a different story just because of the differences potentially in terms of size. But in our case, it would almost be easier if we had one specific place or one specific reason, but it\'s not that way, neither in the upmarket nor for ADP overall. So there\'s no discernible pattern across – even in the place where we had the concentration of losses this quarter, we can\'t see discernible pattern. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. No, that\'s helpful. And then, the other clarification is just on an environment where you guys are, let\'s say, seeing slower revenue growth. Can you still get operating leverage and increase operating margins? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, yes. And that\'s fully our intention. So obviously, it\'s much easier to get operating leverage and margin improvement when you\'re growing revenues faster. But we are who we are. So we know ourselves very well, and we know that we\'re a $12 billion-plus company. And so we are happy with 7% to 9% revenue growth. And it\'s easier to get margin when you\'re at 9%. Like when you back out disposition that we had with that AdvancedMD business, we were almost getting close to 10% revenue growth at one point. Now we\'re excluding, again, the dispositions this year, we\'re probably closer to 7% or so in terms of our revenue growth. And the reality is that it\'s harder. But we\'re a very disciplined company. And so, for example, you can see our head count growth for our own internal resources slowing down slightly, despite the fact that we\'re still investing in our sales organization, because we have lower volumes. And so we know that, we get that. We\'ve been doing this for 68 years. And so we will adjust appropriately because we still want to deliver great service. Retention is the most important thing for us. And so we don\'t want to cut too much or we\'re not cut because this is a matter of slowing the growth of expense, not cutting expense. But we are slowing the growth of expense in certain areas as our revenue growth slows in order to be able to continue to drive operating efficiencies because we believe there\'s still opportunity for that. We have a lot of process improvement initiatives underway across the company because we believe that the complexity that we have historically had, the number of platforms, all the things that we\'ve been telling you about that we\'re trying to simplify, all those things are margin opportunity for us without affecting our associates and without affecting our clients. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Helpful. Thanks so much for the details. Operator Thank you. And we have time for one final question. And our last question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thank you. Hi, Carlos. Hi, Jan. I guess the first question is, if bookings growth recovers or as bookings growth recovers either because of easier comps or other factors, what is the relationship, the impact on the margins I would imagine would be negative. If you can talk about the specific quantification of that relationship, that would be helpful. And the other modeling question I have is with regards to the go forward tax rate? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I wish there was an easy answer to the question about margin and sales because back to, again, we want to be intellectually honest here. We had two or three years of very robust plus 12% sales growth, new business bookings growth and we drove margin improvement. So we clearly have the capability to drive margin. And some of that depends on the timing of when the investments and the expense go in. So as I think we\'ve mentioned, we\'ve I would say invested a little bit ahead of 2018 from a sales standpoint. If we had strong new bookings growth next year, there might be some incremental variable cost around commissions and so forth. But I\'m not saying it doesn\'t matter. It clearly matters. The math is very straightforward. But we have a lot of levers in our business and we make choices every day in order to balance our objectives, right? And one of our objectives continues to be margin improvement. But we also have an objective around growth. We have an objective around capital return. And we balance all of those things and I think try to do the right thing for our shareholders and our stakeholders. So I guess, the short answer is, we have the ability, I think, to drive margin when new bookings recover. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And on the tax rate, Ashwin, this quarter was onetime unanticipated strong outcome relative to our tax strategies of the R&D credits. So this quarter is not a regular quarter, it was a onetime effect and so we\'re going to be returning to our – well, that said, we\'re not giving guidance for next year. But it\'s certainly not going to be at the level that you saw in the third quarter. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Got it. And the third question I have for you Carlos and Jan is really, as you reflect back on how this year sort of transpired and you think about the operating plan for next year, which you\'re in the process of doing. How does that affect, how you go about doing the operating plan, the fact that you\'re considering and so on? If you can kind of walk through the process, what changes, what doesn\'t change? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that, frankly, the things that we look at and the things we do, many of them, we learn every day. Like, Jan and I are learning every year and every day in our current jobs, and we\'ve learned from our predecessors for many years, and I think this company has a lot of deep experience and knowledge about economic cycles and about how we manage our sales force, et cetera. So we, frankly, would make changes around the edges. But we\'re very consistent in terms of the way we approach things. And so one of our objectives for 2018 is this is the kind of experience and environment that would lead you to be overly conservative. And we want to be very careful about that. And that\'s why we haven\'t "slashed" expenses or sales investment because we just don\'t see the sign that that is the appropriate move right now. And so in a strange way, part of our challenge for 2018 will be to not allow ourselves to become overly conservative because we want to take advantage of the market opportunity that we have in front of us. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. The tenets translate into what you have heard. Our belief that our core strategic platforms need to be funded and need to be innovative. So we have a belief in our core capability to develop those products. And we continue as we had in a prior question, our belief that the service alignment initiative is fundamentally positive for our business outlook going forward. So we need to continue to drive the execution of those core strategic initiatives, and we continue to believe that our sales force has opportunity to execute and we will be funding those appropriately. So those may be the core tenets kind of really executing around the strategy that we have laid out for the last few years, also on 2018 is a fair assumption to make. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Okay. Thank you guys. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a couple of quick closing remarks. Obviously, we acknowledge we had a very challenging quarter. But I think you can also tell from our tone that we still have a lot of confidence in our business model and in our continued ability, not just to grow our business but also to drive operational efficiencies. You probably also can tell that, in particular, I\'m hopeful and optimistic that the continuing labor markets are going to continue to drive value in our HCM solutions for the market. So I think the economic cycle and the tightened labor markets I\'m hoping will help us as we try to reengage our sales growth and our revenue growth. And I think as Jan just mentioned, we\'re going to continue to make the investments in our innovation and simplification efforts because we believe they\'re yielding the right kinds of results. We\'re going to continue to align our service model, so the strategic alignment initiative I think continues to move forward and I think is on plan. And as you also heard, we\'re going to continue to expand our distribution channels because we\'ve shown a historical ability to create opportunities and use our distribution channel to grow the company, which is ultimately our objective. And so with that, I thank you for joining the call and I thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference.

We will take our first question from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. Good morning. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good morning. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Last quarter – I\'m thinking of it as the December quarter – you showed an improvement in client retention, I believe, 10 basis points; in this quarter, the March quarter, down 170 basis points. What was the major change between the December quarter and the March quarter that led to that decline in client revenue retention? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think as we mentioned, I think, in our opening comments, it was concentrated in our legacy platforms in the midmarket and in the upmarket. It was particularly skewed towards the upmarket this quarter. Some of the losses, as you know, we don\'t provide guidance. And in the December quarter, we wouldn\'t have talked about forward-looking retention. But some of the deterioration that we experienced in the quarter was anticipated as a result of some known large losses. We typically have reasonable amount of visibility, sometimes several quarters, if not a year or more, for very large clients when they are moving off of one of our solutions. But I guess the core message we are trying to deliver in our comments is that it continues to be concentrated in our legacy platforms. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. And just as a quick follow-up, it would seem that the decline in new bookings this year and some of the pressure on client revenue retention would be more consequential for fiscal 2018 given the way your revenue model works. Can you give us some preliminary thoughts about fiscal 2018 based on the retention trends and the booking trends you\'re seeing in FY 2017? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think you\'re right about the way the math works for our business. And I think that\'s why Jan was very clear in kind of reaffirming our guidance for, obviously, the rest of the year, because we\'re so far into the year that these variations and retention in sales have very low impact on the current next quarter and even maybe one quarter after that. But clearly, going forward, for the next fiscal year, it does roll into the math in terms of that waterfall chart that we\'ve shared with you. As you know, we don\'t provide guidance for fiscal year 2018 until our August call. So we\'re really in the middle of our operating plan process and we\'ll obviously have better information then in terms of how that waterfall chart exactly falls through in terms of the various factors that impact our revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that\'s true. But, David, you\'re mathematically correct that our new business bookings get implemented and turn into revenue after six months approximately and so some of the impact of our lower retention and lower sales will be seen in the revenue growth next year, as you roll it forward. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just the first one, if I heard you correctly, it sounded like the midmarket client migrations have been pushed out by two quarters. The question, I guess, is why have you pushed that out? And then expanding on that a little bit further, as you\'re starting, it sounds like with the upmarket – how has what you\'ve seen in midmarket colored your expectations and how you are going to approach the upmarket? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think, you\'re right about the timing that we were hoping that we would be done. I think our wording was that we would be done somewhere around the end of this fiscal year. And so, now we\'re saying by the end of the calendar year. Realistically, we really don\'t do migrations in November and December because we have year-end and a lot of activities going on. So it\'s really a few months and its a few clients or a few thousand clients, because in the midmarket, we\'re talking about clients in the thousands. And just as a reminder, there were tens of thousands. I think the total number of client migrations was somewhere around 50,000 or 60,000 clients. And so what we\'re talking about is, I would say, a couple of thousand stragglers that we felt, in order to just meet an artificial deadline wasn\'t worth. We learned our lesson, I think, a year-and-a-half ago around when we had to accelerate, in some cases we were forced to accelerate migrations as a result of ACA to get clients on our new platform in order to be able to give them that solution. We learned through that process that you want to really truly upgrade the clients and have them feel that it\'s an upgrade, not a forced march or a negative experience. And so we\'re just focused on making sure that it\'s the right kind of experience and we felt like a couple of thousand clients falling over from one fiscal year to the other is really not that big of a deal in our minds. And I think it\'s the right thing to do. And I think, to answer your question about how that experience colors our approach in the upmarket, again, I think we learned some lessons in terms of making sure that we do things at the proper pace, and that we do it in partnership with our clients. And I think that becomes much more important in the upmarket where it\'s much more complex, and clients have, in many cases, provide a lot of their own internal resources in order to make a migration happen. In the small market, when we did those migrations, there was very little effort and very little need for clients to be involved. In the midmarket, there was a little bit more effort and a little more involvement by the clients. And in the upmarket, there\'s quite a lot of involvement. And hence, it has to be much more carefully planned and, hence, you\'re probably hearing from us that it\'s going to be a longer process in terms of getting those upgrades completed. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Then just a follow-up, as you\'ve had a little more time in the new service delivery geographies, how was the ability to find talent then? How is it compared to your expectations for shifting to those locations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think it\'s fair to say that we are – and again, we\'re early in our goals here. But really, we\'re on track. So we\'re actually quite pleased. We\'ve got several thousand people already hired in our new locations in Orlando, in Maitland, which is near Orlando; in Norfolk, Virginia; and we\'re already hiring also in Tempe. And it is in addition to Augusta and El Paso where we already had two strategic locations. And we have a couple of other key locations, but those are the ones that we\'ve been talking the most about regarding our strategic alignment initiative. So I\'d say we\'re pleased with the talent, we\'re pleased with the pace. I think we\'re on plan in terms of the number of people we were intending to hire. We\'re on plan in terms of the wage levels and the quality of the talent. I have obviously visited, and I think Jan, we\'ve all visited these locations. In fact, we had a very large associate town hall meeting in our Norfolk, Virginia location. And it may be a honeymoon phase but it\'s an incredibly energetic environment. People are very positive and very bullish on ADP. I think we\'re considered a great employer in the markets that we are entering. And we\'ve got a lot of help from other parts of the organization getting these folks trained and ready to be able to actually deliver service, and in some cases they obviously already are. And that\'s why we have some of these dual operations cost that Jan has referred to a couple of times, because we\'re trying to make sure that we do this in a very careful and methodical way. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning. Thanks as always for all the disclosure. Just a couple of questions. Just on the pricing front, on successfully migrating clients to the new strategic platforms, any surprises there? Did that contribute at all to the bookings forecast? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just to be clear, when we migrate our clients, the migration itself is not counting as a new business booking because business bookings account only incremental recurring revenue that we report. So the migration is generally cost-neutral to our clients, and they have enhanced feature functionality with a new product that they get. In the process, clients continue to make buying decisions and buy incremental modules as they do, and we have seen that trend continue in particular in the midmarket. But the actual migration is revenue-neutral, as we approach it, and that will be the same for all upmarket clients. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Thanks for that clarification. I wasn\'t sure if the change might get captured in the (24:26) business bookings. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. So the change – if a client buys more, I don\'t have the most recent statistics here, but I think the trends continue that a number of clients purchases incremental modules as they see the power of the integrated platform. And so there is some slight revenue uptick that we do see for the clients who choose it and only that incremental revenue would be reflected. But it would be immaterial for the new business bookings number in total. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. One more quick follow-up. I know Jan because you\'ve been sort of, I guess, signaling or suggesting that some of these things could happen with ACA. But I\'m just curious, just looking back now, is some of the reduction in this bookings outlook – is there a way to quantify how much might be related to the weak follow-through on ACA module sales and the related tough comp on ACA modules versus maybe a pull-forward of broader payroll HCM sales related to ACA? Do you follow my question? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I do. And I think that it is – as I think we\'ve been trying to signal for, I think, probably three years if you go back to my notes, it\'s very hard because we\'re obviously in uncharted territories, because we were in something completely new. And it was a very comprehensive regulatory framework that required a lot of information from HR platforms, payroll platforms, benefit platforms, et cetera. And when you look back, we had two years of more than 12% new business bookings growth. And this is why we were cautious all along because that is a little strong. We were happy with it and we take it. It\'s good for our shareholders. It\'s good for ADP. It\'s good for our revenues. But it definitely felt like a fairly significant tailwind. And I think, in hindsight, it was obviously a big tailwind. Now, what has now added, I think, potentially to that pressure, which again we can\'t quantify scientifically is that we have, I think, a different environment politically that\'s creating some uncertainty, that certainly has impacted our new business bookings. We just can\'t put our finger on exactly to what extent. So as an example, we knew we had a grow-over issue just for ACA itself because we had already sold 50% of our addressable client base. But we did have some planned sales of ACA this year. And even though we\'ve gotten some, it\'s significantly lower than plan, which is not surprising given the headlines and the frequent votes on repeal and replace of ACA. And so I think that\'s a second factor that I think was not certainly anticipated as we entered into this fiscal year in terms of our planning process. We knew we had to grow over the mathematical grow-over issue. Now we have what I would call the political issue. And then the third one that you mentioned, which again, is very hard for us to put our finger on, but I think you\'re onto something because we experienced the same thing back when we had the Y2K phenomenon in year 2000, where you do have some amount of pull forward, if you will, of business because we\'ve seen this particularly on some of our wins last year from ERPs were quite high and elevated. And I think some of that, it appears, with the benefit of hindsight is, people on kind of older legacy technology trying to find a new solution for ACA. And by the way, some of that happened to us. So as we mentioned, before we think some of our retention issues last year may have been related to the same factor of people kind of just out looking for new solutions as a result of what I would call an event, which is a significant event called ACA. So I think all three things are a factor. We really wish we could put our finger on exactly how much each one is accountable. But unfortunately, we can\'t. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. Thanks so much for the insights. It\'s helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to follow-up on the prior question. On the new bookings weakness you\'re seeing and specifically the revision to guidance. Obviously, going from flat to down 5% for the full year. I think you had talked the last quarter about seeing confidence in improving bookings rates as you head through the end of the year. I guess, maybe you could talk anecdotally about what changed from three months ago to today in terms of specific client conversations you\'re having, is it simply the regulatory environment, uncertainty, seizing things up in terms of purchasing decisions? And then if you got any color on what clients are telling you about what they have to see to get more confidence to book? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think that a couple of comments and maybe Jan can add in terms of his observations. We\'ve obviously been meeting frequently with our sales leaders, and I\'ve been going around sales meetings trying to get to put my finger on the pulse. And it doesn\'t appear that it\'s the economy, because we have very robust and strong results in our downmarket. Our PEO is still doing well. Our MNC business had a great quarter. A lot of the channels that we sell through small business like our Insurance Services products and our Retirement Services products are also doing quite well. So it\'s really not an across-the-board weakness. It does appear to be concentrated in places where we had the ACA phenomenon, if you will. And then how much of it is related to just the grow-over itself versus uncertainty about the political environment, and the fact that the people maybe are sitting and waiting. We do have some information around our pipeline, which is not the same as bookings. So bookings are bookings, and we are very clear about how we count revenues. And I think Jan just went through the math. But we do have pipeline reports like any sales force would have pipeline reports. And in our midmarket and our upmarket, we feel pretty good like we did last quarter about our pipeline. So if we say we feel pretty good and the sales are not materializing, that can only lead to only one conclusion, which is the decision-making is getting elongated or slowing. And we can\'t quite put our finger on why, but that\'s exactly the math is showing versus our pipeline right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think the only thing, Jim, just keep in mind our new guidance is down 5% to 7%, is our expected new business bookings guidance and I think Carlos captured it. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Understand. And then maybe as a follow-up. Can you maybe just talk about the regulatory environment changes and what impact that could have on the PEO business? And specifically, what\'s your confidence level in that PEO business kind of sustaining double-digit growth for the foreseeable future? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good question. Actually, let me finish also. I think you mentioned about like tone in the sales force. And one of the kind of surprising things for me at least is the tone in the sales force is still very positive. Like, we\'ve done some things to try to "encourage people not to throw in the towel" because this is another factor that I have to worry about, right, that we are close to our end of our fiscal year, and the way our incentive systems work, there\'s a big incentive when you\'re exceeding plan to over exceed it. And, likewise, there\'s a bit of an incentive to throw in the towel, if you will, if you\'re having a bad year. So we\'ve done some things to try to – and that may be why the sales forces still remains upbeat, or maybe because they think these issues are transitory. It\'s very, again, hard to put a scientific answer on it. But it feels positive in terms of the tone in the sales force. On the question about PEO and the regulatory environment, I think I mentioned multiple times also in the PEO over the last couple of years that it felt like we were getting some tailwind as a result of ACA, if for no other reason because it was creating conversation opportunities, right. Because people are looking for a solution and they\'re looking at maybe different alternatives and someone is able to talk to them about the PEO, and I think it\'s compelling value proposition they\'re able to close the business. So I would put the PEO in the same category that we were watching, if you will. It\'s not quite the same in the sense that many of the clients in the PEO are not necessarily buying only ACA. And we\'re not rushing to make a decision of that magnitude only because of ACA. So I think there\'s a subtle but important difference. So I\'m not convinced and we certainly aren\'t seeing it in the numbers yet that the PEO will have the same kind of difficulties, if you will, growing over. But it\'s definitely a more difficult sales environment for the PEO. But having said that, just again we\'ve said this multiple times that the PEO has grown double-digits for, I think, its 17 years now. And so it\'s just a very compelling value proposition. And if, for example, there are changes in the regulatory landscape, some parts of our business may be affected like our direct ACA product, if the entire thing gets repealed and the whole thing goes away, that would not be good news for that part of the business. But, as we know now from what we\'re hearing of what\'s growing through Congress, there\'s not going to be a complete repeal. There\'s going to be some kind of new framework. Those types of new frameworks are always good for the PEO because they intend to be more state-based regulation, which is what the PEO is really good at and what small companies are not very good at in having to deal with. And so I think that I would remain generally optimistic and positive – more optimistic and more positive about the PEO. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is open. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first, just wanted to start off, I know you just touched on this a little bit, but a little more color would be helpful. I mean, I understand why businesses are holding off with regards to ACA solutions, just given the uncertainties that you mentioned around healthcare in the U.S. as a whole. But at the end of the day, the law is the law, right. So kind of like at what point, if reform keeps being delayed, do you think employers will start to demand the solutions you\'re offering around ACA and just make other buying decisions in general that they may have been holding off because of the uncertainty? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We were hoping that that would happen two weeks ago or three weeks ago when President said that he was done with it and that we\'re moving on to tax reform. And unfortunately, that was not – it appears not to have been the case. So I think we\'re watching the same news you\'re watching. We do have obviously some access to and some information that we get from people in Washington about what\'s happening on the Hill and the regulation and so forth. But we have kind of similar information to what everyone else has. And these things always, when you\'re in the middle of them, feel like your feet are in cement. And that\'s how it feels like to us right now. It\'s very frustrating but these things pass. We will look back a year or two from now and there will either be the existing ACA or some other version or some more complicated state regime or complex regulatory framework at the state level. And we\'ll hopefully be looking back and seeing this as yet another opportunity for ADP to shine and to help our clients. But right now, it is what it is, and it doesn\'t feel great. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Thanks. And then just to follow up, when you think about the slide that you guys put out, just your long-term growth driver, the 7% to 9% that you think of the longer term and I think you have like a 14% to 15% new business bookings and 7% to 8% reduction from client losses. Just how does that math change given the bookings guidance that you\'re seeing right now? And I know 2018 is a little early, but just any color you can give us on how to think about how that 7% to 9% growth might be impacted for fiscal 2018? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. Our longer-term expectations for organic growth is 7% to 9%, as you correctly quoted. And it\'s driven by growth of new business bookings in the range of 8% to 10% growth. And it always was meant to cover multiple year type of cycle elongated and it was not a commitment obviously, as you see realistically – not a commitment to perform every single fiscal year. So we are not updating our long-term growth outlook at this point in time. But, clearly, our new business bookings have fallen a little bit behind, but relative to a three- or four-year cycle of new business bookings, we still feel good about our growth opportunities. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just want to understand the bookings a little bit more. So a two-part question, part math, part more subjective. So the math is just to get the full-year guidance. Seems like you\'re implying potentially further deterioration in the fourth quarter, unless maybe the weighting from the third quarter is disproportionate, so maybe some clarification there. And then the second part of that is maybe you can just talk about the cadence exiting the selling season and into April? Carlos, you already talked a little bit about hoping to see some change as of two weeks ago but not seeing it but maybe just a little bit more color. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think you\'re right that the third quarter is disproportionate. So we have a lot of – disproportionate number of dollar sales in the third quarter compared to the entire year. And that\'s just the way the seasonality has always worked. So the fourth quarter would not be materially different in terms of the momentum or this kind of the 5% to 7% down range. It\'s in that ballpark. So there is really no real news I think there. I think the cadence in terms of the exit for the – the one thing that we\'re grappling with is, obviously, we have the realities, right, of the political environment and we\'re hoping that there will be resolution here relatively soon. Our fiscal year, obviously, starts on July 1. We\'re hoping to have some kind of – we thought two, three weeks ago, we had clarity. So we\'re hoping that we get that behind us and we get some clarity, because we have lots of other products. We have lots of other parts of our business that are performing well. And we just want to get on with it, right, and be able to continue to sell the other suite of products that we have available both in the midmarket and also in the upmarket. So I think, as I mentioned before, it feels like exiting the year, our pipelines are robust. It feels like the tone and the confidence in the sales force is high. But the results are the results. And I think Jan and I live in a world of reality, not in the world of make-believe. And so we\'re being cautious and careful, but it\'s hard not to be optimistic because the economy is picking up it feels like. The labor markets are tightening. And we have some very compelling value propositions in that kind of environment where employers now are going to be "engaging" in a war for talent again, which we haven\'t seen. We forget that 10 years ago there was real issue in terms of finding people. And we benefited back then from that kind of environment in terms of our HCM solutions, and we\'re hoping that we\'re entering a period here where all of our solutions, the entire suite becomes very compelling as clients become focused on attracting people and holding onto the people that they have. And we see all kinds of metrics in our own numbers and in the government data around higher voluntary turnover, higher wage growth, lots of signals that the labor markets are tightening. And I think our value propositions are very compelling in that kind of environment. So we just want to get this uncertainty and these delays and this slow decision-making behind us so that we can get on to the business. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe just... Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ...a little comment to this on the outlook, which Carlos described correctly kind of roughly in line with fourth quarter and the full-year guidance. But we\'ll also continue to put our dollars where our statements are and the investments into the sales force, the incentives that we\'re bringing out to get the sales force ready, and the hiring and preparing for growth in the next year are actually fully underway and have actually to some degree impacted our third quarter and fourth quarter results because we believe we have that opportunity going forward. So we\'re preparing for growth in the future. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. And then just a question on retention. I just wanted to clarify. So it sounded like some of the higher attrition was in the upmarket and was partly related to migration. But at the same time, you\'re taking a more measured pace with your migration relative to what you do with Workforce Now. So just trying to square that and see maybe where any surprises came versus expectations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Maybe one is connected to the other and maybe not. Because I think the reality is that the variability and I think we\'re very sensitive now obviously to retention for all the right reasons because we went through a really difficult last year, but we\'ve had variability in our retention forever at ADP because it\'s a different metric than our other metrics and it can be volatile. And as an example, in the upmarket, you can have one or two large clients that can actually move that number – one or two clients in the upmarket that can move the number for the upmarket and for ADP. And you saw a little bit of that in the first quarter where we lost that large government contract and the business that we ended up selling or were in the process of selling that had a material impact on our overall retention for the first quarter. So this wasn\'t one large client like that, but it was a handful of clients. And so our upmarket business is a little less than 20% of our overall revenue, so just to kind of put things in context and it\'s 2,000 to 3,000 clients. And a couple, literally, three, four client losses in a particular quarter can really move the number. So I was just trying to help kind of frame the discussion because at least for now I\'m not ready to conceive that we have a permanent – we don\'t talk about forward guidance on retention, but this is a third quarter issue for now. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. All right. One more on the topic of the day, retention. So the upmarket dynamic you\'re describing, I guess, does feel like it\'s a little bit new. Is there a change in the competitive landscape in the upmarket? Or is there anything you can identify that triggered I guess this handful of clients this quarter? Or is it just somewhat anomalous? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s a good question. And I think that you\'d be generally I think right that despite the fact that we do have volatility across quarters, we have generally not paid a lot of attention to it because over the course of kind of rolling 12 months or even in terms of years, calendar years or even fiscal years, our retention in the upmarket has been pretty stable. I mean it\'s a sticky business. It doesn\'t change a whole lot. So I\'d say this quarter was – I\'d say it\'s fair that it\'s a little bit anomalous. And I think the answer to your other part of question; we don\'t see it as being related to any change in the competitive environment. Now, as always, in two to three years or in two to three quarters, I may be singing a different tune, but we have a lot of data around the reasons for the losses, what platform the losses were on, were they new technology, old technology, and what types of product the client had. And I think when we put all that information together, which Jan and I, obviously, spent a lot of time anticipating this being one of the topics of the day, we\'ve spent a lot of time on this issue and looked at the names of the clients, who they are, what platforms they were on, and we don\'t see any change in the competitive environment. I think we\'ve said before that there isn\'t any one competitor that causes us a majority of our losses, and likewise there isn\'t any one competitor where we take the majority of our business from. It\'s spread out all over the landscape and it remains that way. For some of our competitors that might be different because of their size where they may have a heavy concentration of taking clients from one particular company. In our case, that is not the case. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe a tiny bit of further detail, Lisa, is when we look at our competitive position against this multitude of competitors in the quarter, some competitive positions have improved and some have not. And that is a fairly typical thing we see each of these competitors evolving quarter-by-quarter up and down. So when we say the general competitive dynamic we feel has not changed, it\'s rooted in this analysis, and we see in some cases we have improved and some cases we have not. So it\'s a mixed bag obviously, but we believe it hasn\'t changed. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think I didn\'t maybe answer directly your question about how does this square with our upgrade or migrations strategy. And I think the things really are somewhat connected in maybe an odd way that we think that because we know what clients we lost and what platforms they were on that it makes it even more compelling for us to move our clients onto our newer technologies. On the other hand, we know that these movements are complex and that the clients need to help us and they need to be involved, they need to cooperate. And so finding the right clients in the right place at the right time is just different than it was in the midmarket and in the down market. But it think it heightens our confidence that it\'s the right thing to do over time. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. And then I guess the follow-up, as we\'ve been living with you through the Workforce Now migrations in the midmarket, I know you\'ve consistently said that the retention levels are higher on the migrated clients and so there\'s sort of this nirvana we are going to get to when the migrations are done where retention should naturally go back up. Are we though now facing a more protracted period in the upmarket kind of going to the same thing? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the nirvana, it does from what Jan and I were looking at just over the last couple of days, their retention rates on our current version Workforce Now strategic platform are extremely high, and we\'re very happy with them and we have a lot of volume on it already. So that feels like it worked out the way we had hoped and we had anticipated. And with now the down-market on our new strategic platform with potential rates that frankly have improved dramatically over the last couple years and with our Workforce Now migrations being completed by the end of this calendar year and with 20% of our base remaining in the upmarket, we\'re feeling good about where we are. But the answer to your question is, yes, we have a protracted migration effort in the upmarket. It\'s the right thing to do. We\'re going to do it, and we\'re going to do it as well as we can and as quickly as we can without causing damage and disruption to our clients. But we\'re in a very different position from where we were four or five years ago when we had 10% of our clients on our strategic platforms that are version-less in cloud where there is no further migration and there is no further disruption. So it\'s a very, very different place and it hasn\'t felt good getting here but it feels pretty good now. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. Maybe quickly just on a more positive note. I know you\'ve had the reporting and benchmarking modules out in the market now at least for a few months. How are they doing? How is the uptake? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s going well. Again, that\'s another one back to the discussion about what\'s happening with the labor markets and the economy in general. Those are products that are useful no matter what, but in the kind of environment that we\'re entering into like helping people make sure that they\'re paying people the right amounts, that they know where their turnover is in comparison to benchmarks, that type of information is very, very useful to an HR leader or to a CEO in making good people decisions on a go-forward basis. So that\'s another example of something that the conversations for the last two or three years were about ACA. I think the conversations for the next two or three years are going to be about what\'s happening with your workforce, what\'s the turnover rate, how are you paying people. And I think these benchmark and analytics tools are going to facilitate those discussions, and hopefully, those sales because those are conversation openers or starters in order to convince clients to come to our product suite, which is I think unique in a sense that it has these data and analytics benchmarks. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Terrific. Thank you. Thanks for all the transparency as usual. Operator Thank you. And our next question will come from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you so much. A few times you mentioned the uncertainty and you thought it might have dissipated a few weeks ago when we had a little bit more clarity on ACA. Is the client uncertainty and the elongated decision-making you think it\'s solely related to ACA issues? Are there just other things going on in the current environment that clients are worried about? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Again, I\'ll just say one more time. It\'s impossible for us. We don\'t really have like a chart that kind of follows that. So this is really more on intuition, and I\'ll let Jan comment as well. But it\'s not just ACA that\'s creating uncertainty. I think the administration has asked the Labor Department to review the overtime rules, for example, that were about to be issued. I think there were pay equity rules that were coming out around EEOC reporting that are now under review as well. The fiduciary rule, which was intended to go through the – which would have affected our Retirement Services business has also been put under review. And so I think there are pockets of uncertainty in addition to ACA. And some of them happened to be related to our core business, which is HCM. And so if you\'re selling, for example, an ERP suite, some of that uncertainty may not really affect that decision-making. But if we were involved in a sales process where you had a large hourly workforce and many of them – sorry, a large salaried workforce because of the new rules was going to now be hourly and those hours needed to be tracked and you needed to be in compliance with the FLSA, that sales cycle has probably been elongated as a client stops and goes back to focusing on whatever they were focusing on before that trigger event. So I think there are a few other things that are probably not helpful, but again, it\'s hard for us to put a specific measure on each one of them. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. I understand and I appreciate the color. And then just one, I guess, numbers or model-related question. When do we anniversary the bump in bookings from all the ACA-driven business? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, next fiscal year, we are clearly half – still a little bit of grow-over but not that material. So next year should be a clean year relative to the ACA-related grow-over. Just a further clarification, we have tried to illustrate this a few times. With the ACA core module that we have sold came off an incremental fuller bundled sales that particularly included benefit administration module. So the impact of the Affordable Care Act have been broader than the direct impact of the ACA-related sales, which makes it a little bit harder to predict. And as a consequence, our clients (54:35) typically provides ADP-wide about 50% of our incremental new business bookings, however, come from selling more to existing clients. And that dynamic has now changed because we have fuller bundles now in particular in the midmarket. And so we started to transition to drive new logo growth in the midmarket and those channels have to readjust a little bit as a consequence of the ACA surge that has driven a more complete bundle in particular in the midmarket. So that transition is still present obviously next year, but we feel that we have great strategies in place to replace basically that up-sell strategy with a more aggressive new logo sales. And as we have clarified, it is a disappointing quarter, but despite our down guidance for new business booking sale, it will still be our second highest sales year ever for ADP. So keep that in mind. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. This is actually Jay Hanna on for Gary today. Kind of going off that last comment, going forward, given the struggles with the client retention this quarter and the now expected decline in bookings, should we expect an even greater spend on sales force additions going forward? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, it\'s funny you should mention that, because I think Jan I think did address and I\'ll let him if he wants to give more detail, which we probably don\'t because we\'re not giving FY 2018 guidance yet. But we\'re definitely not taking our foot off of the accelerator. So we obviously could change our minds a quarter or two from now, but our position right now is I think we mentioned it in Jan\'s comments, we\'re maintaining our investments in service, implementation, et cetera. And in some cases we\'ve actually accelerated or increased some of our investments. And I think in the sales organization is a place where I would say we\'ve added expense. And the irony is that the underlying sales expense gets helped by weaker sales because our commissions are lower and so forth, but there\'s a lot of things that go into that sales expense bucket, including head count cost and commissions. And so it\'s safe to say that our commission expense and our variable expense is helping us from a cost standpoint. But instead of taking that all to the bottom line, we have chosen to invest because, again, we believe our story which is that nothing fundamentally has changed in the economy, which is typically what really affects ADP, which by the way affects us less than most because of the nature of our business model. But if we saw a recession coming or a slowdown coming, we would have to start thinking hard about our expense levels. And that\'s not where we are right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a quick reminder, as one of the advantages of ADP is that we serve such a broad range of segments and markets in the U.S. and globally and multinational, and so as we had our challenges in the mid and upmarket, we continue to perform tremendously in the down-market, in the PEO, multinational. So there\'s a broad range of products that are gaining share and really driving success. So obviously, in that balance, our investments into sales signal our confidence for ultimate success in distribution. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of product-related questions. With regards to the higher ratings in terms of the G2 for Workforce Now, at what point do you start pivoting from migration of existing clients to proactively selling Workforce Now to clients that aren\'t currently utilizing ADP at all in the midmarket? That\'s the first question. And then secondly, can you tell us where we are with regards to Vantage in terms of the optimization of that solution, and when you would feel really good about pushing that? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the answer on the Workforce Now question is, about three or four months ago because I think Jan just alluded to that that we\'ve kind of tilted our focus now more towards new logo growth and new share from kind of the traditional approach of – doesn\'t mean we won\'t take additional modules and incremental business. But this is a fairly significant change from a sales force mentality standpoint where we were for several years focused on upgrades and on incremental sales of other modules to the existing client base as we upgraded them combined with selling something called ACA, which to some extent was a significant tailwind. So we\'re moving into a different environment. Luckily, we have other tailwinds like great products like you just mentioned with Workforce Now, and we can see, for example, our client satisfaction scores improving. We can see our client retention scores on our strategic platform being very, very high, higher than we\'ve had overall for the midmarket historically. So there\'s a lot of positive signs that we want to step on the accelerator and proactively sell our solution just as you mentioned. And I think we kind of got that religion, if you will, I don\'t know four to six months ago. And we\'ve been retooling, right, in terms of – I think Jan alluded to channels. I think if we\'re going to go after incremental new logos, not just add-on business that requires channel partnerships. And I think there\'s a lot of effort underway to build the same kind of success we have in our downmarket now with our midmarket channel partners. And so, the answer is, we\'re on that and we believe that, that will get traction over time. On the question about Vantage, Vantage continues to do quite well. And there, again, our satisfaction scores, for implementation have improved dramatically over the last several quarters as we invested in that process of the implementation process. I think we have like almost 350 live clients, versus I think we were at 220 at the beginning of the fiscal year. We have I think 500 sold, so we have a decent pipeline that needs to be implemented. And I don\'t mean pipeline. Those are actually signed contracts, 500 signed contracts. And so, we feel pretty good about our Vantage platform. I think it compares really well and competes very well with our upmarket competitors. But you all see the same thing we see. It\'s a very competitive environment in the upmarket and there are a lot of solutions. But we like what we have, and I think we\'re competing very effectively. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. And next a quick follow-up. With regards to the dual service platforms, do you still think that by the end of calendar 2018 you\'ll have completed that transition to the new service platforms? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. You\'re never complete on operations, Mark, but the majority of our work is actually this fiscal year and next fiscal year. So in next fiscal year I\'d still anticipate some dual ops. We haven\'t determined what that will be specifically, but there is still transitioning happening, but the vast majority relative to those three new locations and the two existing ones should be completed in 2018. But our service strategy is obviously organic and evolving and we\'re going to continue to drive improvements, but 2018 is a big year still for us. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Just two quick clarifications. Just on the retention. Do we know where these clients are going? Are they bringing it in-house, the service? Just curious. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. The sources of our business and the sources of our losses is something that we track. And both have very similar dynamics. It\'s a fragmented and there\'s no clear trend to it, and so they go to a variety of different targets. Some in the ERP space, some to our traditional competitors, some to other solutions, so it is a wide range. Some is driven by their M&A activity, moving to on (1:03:41). So the loss reasons and their targets is varied as the sources of our businesses are varied and as a consequence we feel the competitive dynamic has not fundamentally changed as we observe it. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And we did look at that. I happened to look at it last night. I asked for a little more detail in terms of our upmarket losses and unfortunately I didn\'t compare the same "top losses" to last year third quarter top losses, but when we looked at this year\'s third quarter losses, there were a couple that went back in-house. That we\'re using, for example, our COS solution, which is our BPO solution upmarket, and I guess they decided to go back and rebuild internal capabilities and use their internal technology. But I think Jan described it well, because I mean we sound elusive when we give you that answer, but it\'s really all over the board. And maybe that\'s because of our size because again, and just to continue to emphasize some of our competitors would have a different story just because of the differences potentially in terms of size. But in our case, it would almost be easier if we had one specific place or one specific reason, but it\'s not that way, neither in the upmarket nor for ADP overall. So there\'s no discernible pattern across – even in the place where we had the concentration of losses this quarter, we can\'t see discernible pattern. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. No, that\'s helpful. And then, the other clarification is just on an environment where you guys are, let\'s say, seeing slower revenue growth. Can you still get operating leverage and increase operating margins? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, yes. And that\'s fully our intention. So obviously, it\'s much easier to get operating leverage and margin improvement when you\'re growing revenues faster. But we are who we are. So we know ourselves very well, and we know that we\'re a $12 billion-plus company. And so we are happy with 7% to 9% revenue growth. And it\'s easier to get margin when you\'re at 9%. Like when you back out disposition that we had with that AdvancedMD business, we were almost getting close to 10% revenue growth at one point. Now we\'re excluding, again, the dispositions this year, we\'re probably closer to 7% or so in terms of our revenue growth. And the reality is that it\'s harder. But we\'re a very disciplined company. And so, for example, you can see our head count growth for our own internal resources slowing down slightly, despite the fact that we\'re still investing in our sales organization, because we have lower volumes. And so we know that, we get that. We\'ve been doing this for 68 years. And so we will adjust appropriately because we still want to deliver great service. Retention is the most important thing for us. And so we don\'t want to cut too much or we\'re not cut because this is a matter of slowing the growth of expense, not cutting expense. But we are slowing the growth of expense in certain areas as our revenue growth slows in order to be able to continue to drive operating efficiencies because we believe there\'s still opportunity for that. We have a lot of process improvement initiatives underway across the company because we believe that the complexity that we have historically had, the number of platforms, all the things that we\'ve been telling you about that we\'re trying to simplify, all those things are margin opportunity for us without affecting our associates and without affecting our clients. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Helpful. Thanks so much for the details. Operator Thank you. And we have time for one final question. And our last question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thank you. Hi, Carlos. Hi, Jan. I guess the first question is, if bookings growth recovers or as bookings growth recovers either because of easier comps or other factors, what is the relationship, the impact on the margins I would imagine would be negative. If you can talk about the specific quantification of that relationship, that would be helpful. And the other modeling question I have is with regards to the go forward tax rate? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I wish there was an easy answer to the question about margin and sales because back to, again, we want to be intellectually honest here. We had two or three years of very robust plus 12% sales growth, new business bookings growth and we drove margin improvement. So we clearly have the capability to drive margin. And some of that depends on the timing of when the investments and the expense go in. So as I think we\'ve mentioned, we\'ve I would say invested a little bit ahead of 2018 from a sales standpoint. If we had strong new bookings growth next year, there might be some incremental variable cost around commissions and so forth. But I\'m not saying it doesn\'t matter. It clearly matters. The math is very straightforward. But we have a lot of levers in our business and we make choices every day in order to balance our objectives, right? And one of our objectives continues to be margin improvement. But we also have an objective around growth. We have an objective around capital return. And we balance all of those things and I think try to do the right thing for our shareholders and our stakeholders. So I guess, the short answer is, we have the ability, I think, to drive margin when new bookings recover. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And on the tax rate, Ashwin, this quarter was onetime unanticipated strong outcome relative to our tax strategies of the R&D credits. So this quarter is not a regular quarter, it was a onetime effect and so we\'re going to be returning to our – well, that said, we\'re not giving guidance for next year. But it\'s certainly not going to be at the level that you saw in the third quarter. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Got it. And the third question I have for you Carlos and Jan is really, as you reflect back on how this year sort of transpired and you think about the operating plan for next year, which you\'re in the process of doing. How does that affect, how you go about doing the operating plan, the fact that you\'re considering and so on? If you can kind of walk through the process, what changes, what doesn\'t change? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that, frankly, the things that we look at and the things we do, many of them, we learn every day. Like, Jan and I are learning every year and every day in our current jobs, and we\'ve learned from our predecessors for many years, and I think this company has a lot of deep experience and knowledge about economic cycles and about how we manage our sales force, et cetera. So we, frankly, would make changes around the edges. But we\'re very consistent in terms of the way we approach things. And so one of our objectives for 2018 is this is the kind of experience and environment that would lead you to be overly conservative. And we want to be very careful about that. And that\'s why we haven\'t "slashed" expenses or sales investment because we just don\'t see the sign that that is the appropriate move right now. And so in a strange way, part of our challenge for 2018 will be to not allow ourselves to become overly conservative because we want to take advantage of the market opportunity that we have in front of us. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. The tenets translate into what you have heard. Our belief that our core strategic platforms need to be funded and need to be innovative. So we have a belief in our core capability to develop those products. And we continue as we had in a prior question, our belief that the service alignment initiative is fundamentally positive for our business outlook going forward. So we need to continue to drive the execution of those core strategic initiatives, and we continue to believe that our sales force has opportunity to execute and we will be funding those appropriately. So those may be the core tenets kind of really executing around the strategy that we have laid out for the last few years, also on 2018 is a fair assumption to make. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Okay. Thank you guys. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a couple of quick closing remarks. Obviously, we acknowledge we had a very challenging quarter. But I think you can also tell from our tone that we still have a lot of confidence in our business model and in our continued ability, not just to grow our business but also to drive operational efficiencies. You probably also can tell that, in particular, I\'m hopeful and optimistic that the continuing labor markets are going to continue to drive value in our HCM solutions for the market. So I think the economic cycle and the tightened labor markets I\'m hoping will help us as we try to reengage our sales growth and our revenue growth. And I think as Jan just mentioned, we\'re going to continue to make the investments in our innovation and simplification efforts because we believe they\'re yielding the right kinds of results. We\'re going to continue to align our service model, so the strategic alignment initiative I think continues to move forward and I think is on plan. And as you also heard, we\'re going to continue to expand our distribution channels because we\'ve shown a historical ability to create opportunities and use our distribution channel to grow the company, which is ultimately our objective. And so with that, I thank you for joining the call and I thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on May 2, 2017. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website. Also please note that all growth rates references will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Akamai performed well in the first quarter with solid growth on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue in Q1 was $609 million, up 8% year-over-year; our strongest year-over-year growth rate in several quarters. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.69 per diluted share, up 5% year-over-year. Our strong results were driven by our Performance and Security Solutions with revenue growth of 18% over Q1 of 2016. These solutions accounted for over 60% of our overall revenue in Q1 and they contributed very attractive margins. As we discussed at our recent Investor Summit, the EBITDA margin profile for our Performance and Security Solutions has been about 50%. And this figure includes the substantial investments we made last year to innovate and bring compelling new products to market. For example, Ion 3.0, which we launched last month, dramatically improves the mobile experience for end users. For a customer like ZALORA, an Asian fashion retailer, mobile performance is critical because a significant amount of their business comes from mobile users. With Ion 3.0, ZALORA performance was 225% faster over cellular and 250% faster over Wi-Fi. That has translated into higher sales for them and a better experience for their customers. Through our recent acquisition of SOASTA, Ion is now complemented with two exciting new products: mPulse and CloudTest. These innovative solutions will provide our customers with the ability to measure, validate, and improve the business impact of their websites and applications. For example, Lowe's use the full suite of SOASTA capabilities to correlate site performance with sales and then drive e-commerce sales to over $1 billion through increased traffic and conversion rates. On the security front, scale has become critical as typical attacks now contain tens or hundreds of gigabits per second of malicious traffic, more than enough to overwhelm the traditional defenses of even the most well-equipped data centers. To address this expanding threat, we launched Kona Site Defender 5.0 and Web Application Protector in Q1. The new version of Kona Site Defender includes protection for API end points to help secure websites, mobile infrastructure and other API-driven requests. Web Application Protector is designed for the mid-market, providing customers with low touch and virtually maintenance-free protection from the most common DDoS and Web application attacks. We also launched Bot Manager 2.0 earlier this quarter. The new version of Bot Manager features enhanced bot detection and mitigation, along with advanced policy enforcement capabilities. This summer, we expect to further enhance Bot Manager to include innovative machine learning capabilities to better stop account takeover attacks. This technology was obtained in part through our recent acquisition of Cyberfend. We're also planning to bring new enterprise security and networking products to market this year. Our vision for these products is to secure, optimize and accelerate the enterprise network as a service in the cloud. We're doing this by utilizing the power of the Akamai platform to support new services that are simple to understand and easy-to-use, allow customers to try before they buy, allow for a land and expand sales motion, and to create synergies with the rest of our product portfolio. For example, at our recent Investor Summit, we demonstrated our new service for securing access to enterprise applications. Enterprise Application Access, or EAA, leverages software obtained through our recent acquisition of Soha Systems. It addresses the growing need for businesses to more easily and securely manage application access for a growing mix of users with different risk profiles without poking holes in the enterprise firewall. EAA is easy to deploy and simple to manage. Customers can implement it in minutes and then take advantage of Akamai's other performance and security solutions for all their internal applications. At the Investor Summit, we also demonstrated another exciting new offering called Enterprise Threat Protector or ETP. ETP is designed to protect enterprise employees and infrastructure against phishing, malware and data exfiltration attacks by providing a cloud-based recursive DNS service to block access to malware sites and data exfiltration botnets. It's currently in beta with 17 customers, all of whom are able to self integrate and use the product to block malware that evaded their other security systems. ETP is expected to launch this summer. Branch Accelerator is also now in beta. For users in the branch, their enterprise connectivity to the Internet may not be sufficient to support video or downloads without impinging on their ability to do other kinds of work. Branch Accelerator puts Akamai's software in or near the branch office to provide caching, enforce quality of service and ensure protocol optimization, all with the goal of improving branch performance. Our enterprise business is just getting started, and I expect significant growth ahead as we ramp up and launch these new products. Next, I'd like to talk about our Media business. As we discussed in our analyst calls over the last year, our Media business continues to be heavily impacted by the do-it-yourself efforts of six of the largest Internet platform companies. Our Q1 revenue from these companies was $51 million, a 29% decrease over Q1 of 2016. Traffic from our other media customers has continued to grow at a rapid rate, but at a slower pace than we've seen historically. As we discussed in the past, media traffic growth rates are highly variable over time and depend on a variety of factors. Pricing in the media sector remains aggressive, but the rate and pace of price declines continue to be in line with historical trends. The net effect of all these factors is that as we look forward to the rest of 2017, we believe that the revenue growth rate for our Media business will continue to be below the growth rates we've historically seen and that the growth rate for Akamai's overall revenues and margins will continue to be impacted as a result. That said, I want to be very clear that I believe Media is a good business for Akamai and that it has a very bright future. Over the longer term, I believe that the impact of the large platform companies on our Media business will lessen and that the business overall will return to historical levels of performance. One of the reasons for my optimism is our OTT business. A recent study predicts that over-the-top viewing will exceed traditional broadcast viewing within five years. Even if this prediction is only approximately correct, there is the potential for a very large amount of video traffic to move online and Akamai is very well-positioned to benefit as a result. At last week's National Association of Broadcasters, or NAB convention in Las Vegas, I met with executives from several of the world's leading media companies, and they were all talking about the growing demand for OTT content and how Akamai solutions can and do meet their needs. At NAB, we demonstrated two new products that dramatically improve the OTT experience for viewers: Media Services Live and Media Acceleration. Media Services Live was recognized with two awards in the convention. Streaming Media named it as one of six Best of NAB winners. And TV Technology presented Media Services Live with a Best of Show award. Media Services Live features breakthrough technology designed to eliminate the large latencies that are typical with Internet streaming, resulting in a viewer experience that is comparable to or better than traditional broadcast TV. We recently used this new solution to deliver nearly 100 million live video streams for a major sporting event with a 100% ingestion success rate and greater than 99.99% availability for viewers. In addition, we recently launched our new Media Acceleration capability to more efficiently communicate between end-user devices and the Akamai network, thereby providing a much higher-quality video experience for viewers. When Media Acceleration was used for a recent major sporting event, we achieved 72% fewer video start errors, 24% less rebuffering, 23% more HD viewers and 25% more 4K viewers. Better quality video, like HD and 4K, requires higher and more consistent throughput to end-users, which is an area where Akamai excels. Across the world, media companies have come to appreciate that it is very difficult to replicate our ability to deliver online video with broadcast-level quality, scale and security. It's also our belief that Akamai is leading the competition in inventing what's next while improving on what's now. That's always been our heritage. So while today's viewers are consuming live streams over IP, we're anticipating what's coming next: virtual and augmented reality delivered seamlessly anywhere in the world over wired and wireless networks with virtually zero latency. That's the future of the digital media experience, and Akamai is already working hard to enable it. In summary, I'm pleased with our Q1 results and I'm even more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as enormous volumes of video move online, billions of devices get connected, cyber attacks explode in size and sophistication, and enterprise networks undergo a massive change as they turn inside out. I believe that Akamai is uniquely positioned to solve the challenge faced by companies across the world as they try to cope with these major technology shifts. Personally, I'm as excited as ever to be at Akamai. I remain confident in Akamai's future, and even though I'm already a large holder of Akamai shares, I'm happy to announce today that I'll be continuing my personal stock buyback program through a 10b5-1 plan that will purchase $1 million of Akamai stock every month for the rest of 2017. Now let me turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed look at the quarter and then we'll answer your questions. Jim? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom highlighted, Q1 was another solid quarter for Akamai with both revenue and earnings coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Revenue in the first quarter was $609 million, up 7% year-over-year or up 8% in constant currency, and up 13% if you exclude our six large Internet platform customers. Revenue from our Performance and Security Solutions was particularly strong, coming in at $369 million, growing 18% year-over-year and was the driver of delivering to the high end of our guidance in the quarter. Performance and Security Solutions contributed over 60% of our total revenue in Q1. We are very pleased with the continued revenue diversification into our highly differentiated, higher margin and more stable subscription model offerings. Within this solution category, we saw solid growth across all major product lines with particularly strong growth continuing in our Cloud Security Solutions. First quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $110 million, up 37% year-over-year. Our Security business now has an annualized revenue run rate of $450 million. We are pleased with the continued strong growth and execution of our Cloud Security business, led by our flagship Kona Site Defender and Prolexic offerings and our continued portfolio expansion into new areas, like bot management and Enterprise Application Access. And we plan to further broaden our performance, security and enterprise offerings where we see substantial long-term growth potential. And our recent SOASTA acquisition, which closed in early April, is a good example of extending our market-leading Web acceleration offerings into the natural adjacency of Digital Performance Management focusing on cloud application monitoring and testing and aligning performance to business value. Turning now to our Media Delivery Solutions, revenue was $187 million in the quarter, down 9% year-over-year and up 3%, excluding our large Internet platform customers. This revenue growth rate was lower than the past several quarters and below our expectations, driven by a moderation of traffic growth throughout the quarter in our Americas region and within our gaming vertical, most notably. It is important to note that while the pricing environment in the Media business remains highly competitive, aggregate price per bit declines remain roughly within historical norms. As we've discussed in the past, the drivers of the Media business, namely traffic volumes and price, can lead to revenue variability from period to period given the timing of customer renewals at lower price points; the size, timing and delivery mechanism of software and gaming releases; as well as the adoption of social media and video platform capabilities. And while Media growth rates have moderated more than we expected in the near term, we continue to remain bullish on the longer-term secular growth trends for our Media business, particularly in the OTT area, as more video content moves online. Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $53 million in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year. Turning now to our Q1 revenue results by customer division, revenue from our Web Division customers was $305 million, up 15% year-over-year. We continued to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with Cloud Security offerings. Revenue from our Media Division customers was $285 million in the quarter, up 1% year-over-year and up 11%, excluding the impact of the large Internet platform customers. This growth rate was lower than 2016 levels driven by the moderation in media traffic that I mentioned earlier. Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $19 million in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year. Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 33% of total revenue in Q1, up two points from Q4 levels. International market revenue was $203 million in the first quarter, up 19% year-over-year or up 21% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia Pacific region. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a year-over-year basis and $2 million on a sequential basis. Revenue from our U.S. market was $407 million, up 2% year-over-year. The large Internet platform customers who are based in the U.S. continued to weigh heavily on the U.S. market growth rates. Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, consistent with Q4 levels and the same period last year. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 66%, down 1 point from Q4 levels and consistent with the same period last year. GAAP operating expenses were $288 million in the quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other non-recurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $228 million, down seasonally from Q4 levels, but above our guidance range, driven by higher commissions and performance incentives as well as increased recruiting-related spend associated with an uptick in hiring activity. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $241 million, down $6 million from Q4 levels, due to seasonal revenue declines, and up $7 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 39%, down one point from Q4 levels and down two points from Q1 last year and within our guidance range. GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $87 million in the first quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $75 million, up slightly from Q4 levels and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $165 million, down $9 million from Q4 levels from the seasonal revenue declines and up $1 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, down one point from Q4 levels and down two points from the same period last year and within our guidance range. Moving on to other income and expense items, interest income for the first quarter was $5 million, up slightly from Q4 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the first quarter was $81 million or $0.46 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $120 million or $0.69 of earnings per diluted share and at the high end of our guidance, driven by the strong revenue achievement. For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $34 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $49 million based on an effective tax rate of 29%. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter was 175 million shares, unchanged from Q4 levels and down 2 million shares from Q1 of last year. Now I'll review some balance sheet items. Days sales outstanding for the first quarter was 58 days, up four days from Q4 levels and down two days from the same period last year. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $94 million and at the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow generation continued to be solid with cash from operations of $143 million in the first quarter. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is just under $900 million. During the quarter, we spent $72 million on share repurchases, buying back roughly 1.1 million shares. As we discussed in the past, we believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash position is an important competitive differentiator that provides us with the financial flexibility to make key investments at opportune times, including the repurchase program. Over the past five years, we have lowered the company's share count by over 7 million shares or 4% while also spending nearly $1 billion in strategic acquisitions, thereby deploying capital in areas that we believe are in the best long-term interests of the company and our shareholders. In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q1 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of profitable growth for the company. Before we look ahead to Q2, I wanted to spend just a minute on our recent Investor Summit. For those of you that joined us in person or via the webcast, the themes we shared this year were the same as in prior years. There has been a level of consistency in what we've talked about every year, the favorable market trends, the uniqueness in differentiation of the Akamai platform, the leadership position we maintain and the very rapidly changing and evolving cloud ecosystem and a tremendous amount of innovation we've seen across the business and new product adjacencies as well as continued enhancements within our existing core offerings. Innovation is alive and well across all the divisions, and we believe it will be a key enabler for accelerating growth back to double-digits for the company. The fundamentals of our business remain strong. We're continuing to innovate rapidly. And while our investments in new adjacencies will pressure margins in the near term, we believe they will drive significant future top-line and bottom-line growth. As I said at the Investor Summit, we are committed to balancing both top-line and bottom-line over the long term. And I certainly believe that if we continue to execute, we will remain a compelling investment proposition for investors. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect Media growth rates to continue to moderate from Q1 levels and within Americas gaming vertical, most notably. While it is also possible that Media growth rates moderate in the back half of 2017 as well, we remain bullish in the medium- to long-term growth prospects for this business, especially the potential for an increase in the amount of video traffic that could move online. Factoring in the anticipated moderation of Media growth, we are expecting overall Q2 revenue in the range of $597 million to $609 million. At the high end of this range, year-over-year growth would be 8% in constant currency, consistent with Q1 levels and up 2 points from Q2 2016 levels. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on revenue of $6 million compared to Q2 of last year and a positive impact of $3 million sequentially. At these revenue ranges, we expect GAAP gross margins of 65% and cash gross margins of 76%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $235 million to $241 million, up roughly $10 million sequentially at the midpoint. This increase is driven partly by our continued investment in new product innovation, service delivery enablement and platform scaling and partly from absorbing our recent SOASTA acquisition. Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate EBITDA margins of roughly 37%. And while we are not providing specific guidance beyond Q2 during this call, we want to be transparent about our plans to continue to make investments in the business throughout 2017 in the areas outlined earlier even while the Media business experiences a near-term moderation in revenue growth. We believe these are important investments that will enable us to drive accelerated, sustainable, long-term double-digit top and bottom line growth. We are confident we can manage the company within our 37% to 39% EBITDA model, while we may go through some quarters where EBITDA margins fall slightly below these levels, possibly even in the second half of 2017. As I've said in the past, our ability to maintain EBITDA margins within our stated ranges is heavily dependent on revenue volumes, possible M&A and needed investments in the business. Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be $77 million to $79 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 24% for Q2. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.61. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $42 million to $44 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of 29%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 174 million shares. On CapEx, we expect to spend $110 million to $115 million, excluding equity compensation in the second quarter. This is an uptick from Q1 levels, primarily due to some planned facility and IT upgrades as well as continued expansion of our Secure Delivery Network and Prolexic scrubbing capacity. In summary, I am very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Akamai and our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. Thank you, and Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you, sir. Our first question is from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I think the first question that really jumps to mind is the Investor Summit wasn't that long ago and it really feels like there's a change in tone around the Media business. When did that become apparent? Was it apparent earlier in the quarter and you just wanted to focus on the high level of the investment summit (sic) [Investor Summit] (28:54) or is this something that you were expecting better volumes at the end of the quarter type of thing? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah, let me start with, we are very bullish on the Media business. So that has not changed. Nothing has changed about what we believe are the growth prospects for the Media business. Relative to our Investor Summit is that what we did see is that we did see traffic growth moderate, as I mentioned in the Americas region in particular and very notably in our gaming vertical and it moderated throughout the quarter. So it was relatively strong in January and then it moderated in February and then it moderated further in March. And that was really the driver of kind of, I would say, missing our internal expectations. But I'd say we are very, very optimistic about the Media business long-term. And as we said to you guys before, the nature of the Media business is it does go through periods where traffic spikes, traffic softens at times. But over the long-term, we think this is a very good business and it will be a very good grower for the company. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC And then maybe one follow-up question. Can you help us parse maybe the data this way? You give us the geographic and we see the North America weakness in the comments that you made. But if you were to split the platform, the big six out from that, what did North American growth look like, just so we can kind of go to the non-big six in North America to understand what's happening there. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. Well, you got to be careful because the Americas also includes our Media customers as well as our Web customers. I think Americas' growth, if you exclude the large Internet platform customers, was roughly 10%. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from James Breen of William Blair. Your line is open. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC Thanks. Just a couple questions. One, the guidance for next quarter. As you look at that number, approximately SOASTA closed in the beginning of the quarter and I think you had said to be about $20 million of revenues. Is that included in that guidance number just comparing that relative to where consensus is? And then on the big six, you obviously saw pretty good absolute step down in the first quarter from the fourth quarter and the third quarter last year. Is there anything in there that's seasonal in that? And then as you see think about your largest customers now, how big are your top two or three customers as a percentage of revenue? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. So I think the large Internet platform customers for the most part came in line with what we expected in Q1. They do seasonally drop Q4 to Q1. That Q4 seasonally is a large quarter for all – actually, all of our large media customers in particular. So the step down there was not unexpected, pretty much in line with what we thought. Those customers now represent about 8% of our revenues. So the good news is that as we go through this, the diversification of the company's revenue, as I mentioned in the Investor Summit, we are much better diversified from a customer perspective; we're much better diversified from a product category perspective; and we're much better diversified from a geography perspective. So I think the health and diversification of the company's revenue is much better now than it has been. And I think relative to the giants and maybe what we expect them to do kind of longer-term, I think as we've said before, we do expect a further deceleration with two of those six. And we expect them to further kind of decline as they serve more of their traffic themselves. So nothing there has really changed and what we've seen here is very much in line with our expectations. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC And then just on the guidance side, so that guidance will include some portion of the SOASTA revenue since the deal closed in April? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. Yeah. As I said, we're not going to guide specifically on SOASTA's revenues and margins. I said at the Investor Summit that SOASTA probably will generate, call it, roughly $20 million for the remainder of 2017. It could be a little bit less than that. But what you're going to have in the first quarter with SOASTA is, as you know, with purchase accounting, we're going to take a very large deferred revenue haircut. So the revenue in the second quarter will certainly be less than and it will be in the third and the fourth quarter. So it's not that material. We're going to embed that in our Web performance business and we're going to report that within our Performance and Security category. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC And just, finally, just as you look across the division, it seems as though performance and security continue to perform well. So really the weakness we're seeing is mainly in the media side. Around that gaming vertical, is it multiple players? Is it one or two players that you're seeing having the most pressure? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. There's a lot of competition in media and I would say especially when it comes to software downloads, which is where the revenue comes from the gaming vertical. And as the traffic shifts more towards updates that can be done in the background as opposed to a new game where you're sitting there waiting for it in real time, well, that means performance matters less, means pricing is lower, and competition is even stiffer. And we've talked about that before. And I think that's part of what we're seeing here. But there's lots of competition in media, particularly for software downloads and especially if it's in a background kind of mode. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. And, Jim, your comment about Performance and Security, it continues to be a very strong growth for the company. The 18% growth in Q1, last year it consistently grew kind of in the high-teens. So what you see here really is just a little softening in media growth kind of in our Americas region and in the area that we mentioned. Again, this tends to be the nature of the Media business. And I think we've gone through these spells before where media surges and you start to see media accelerate. So it's not uncommon to go through these periods. But I believe we're optimistic about the long-term growth potential, not just for OTT, but also within gaming. That as gaming becomes more and more latency sensitive and performance sensitive, as you see more and more things like AR and VR that, I think, that all of a sudden, the differentiation for Akamai becomes more and more apparent. So we're bullish about the prospects for media. I think we're going to go through some near-term slowing in media, but optimistic about the long-term for media. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC Terrific. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Will Power of Baird. Your line is open. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. We'll move to the next question, please. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Great, guys. Could you give us maybe some color on your Media business percentage where you think you have kind of fairly differentiated services that are not as commodity like we're seeing on software here? And Jim, maybe just give maybe a little more clarity what you're seeing on the guidance on the Media side, how much it'd be down sequentially? Maybe I kind of missed that. But it seems like I'm having a tough time getting to that type of overall revenue guidance that you're providing for the second quarter. Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I'm not sure what else to tell you about the guidance. We don't guide necessarily by product category that our media products were about 3% growth kind of excluding the large Internet platform customers. And our Media Division customer growth was about 10%. So we expect that to further moderate to the areas that I mentioned, which is in the Americas and notably within gaming. We do expect to have continued strong growth in Performance and Security, continue to expect to have good growth within Services. So I think what you're going to see here in the guide is you kind to do it at the midpoint. At the midpoint, you're going to see a further moderation of media growth rates and that's really kind of what it's all about. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. And on Media, can you maybe give us some color on what do you think is more commoditized versus where you have more for a differentiated product? I mean, I think some of your OTT video was fairly unique in terms of quality and scale. Where you're at, at this point, in the business? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. No, I think you characterized it well. At one end of the spectrum, you've got background software downloads, which is not performance sensitive, and that's the best opportunity for competition. Obviously, pricing lower there as well. The other end of the spectrum, you've got live and linear OTT where performance is very sensitive, and it's very challenging to deliver high quality at scale. And you see the great work that we're doing there with the kinds of awards we win at NAB. We're the go-to player for the major events that you watch online and traffic growing well there. And I think really key for us is to see OTT adoption continue, even better if it accelerates, quality levels to improve as broadcasters move more content into the higher-quality formats, HD and someday, 4K. Those are all very good areas for Akamai. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Siti Panigrahi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi. Just switching to Security business. Security this time grew around 35.5% year-over-year. That's a deceleration from last year of 47% and even Q4 of 41%. I'm wondering, for the remaining of the year, I know you don't guide, but are you expecting any kind of new product that's coming in contributing, because if I look at your 2015 to 2016, it decelerated from 49% to 44%. But as you look 2017, what's your expectation in terms of trends and contribution from the newer products? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. Well, let me start and then I can have – Tom can talk a little about the products. I think you're right that the growth rates in Security were in the kind of the high-40%s and then the low-40%s and now they're in the high 30%s. This is a business that is now a annualized run rate of $450 million. Five years ago this was just a idea. So this business is growing very, very rapidly. Its growth rate on a percentage basis is lower because it's on a much, much bigger base. So we're very, very positive about the Security business and our execution in the Security business. And you've got to remember, this is all subscription model offerings. This is not license model. This is literally a subscription model business that now is approaching $0.5 billion. So Tom can talk a little bit about the product categories, but there's a lot going on there. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. I talked about in the prepared remarks that we have the new version of Kona out now, and that includes now protection for API end points. And the way to think about that is for your mobile apps where as you have more mobile apps deployed, the attackers are now going after those and we have a really unique capability to very nicely defend against those. You have the new version of Bot Manager, and that manages the response given to the automated entities that are coming to your websites and apps. There's a wide variety of those. I guess, price scrapers and account takeover attacks being maybe the worst there. And as I talked about with our new machine learning capabilities to be deployed this summer and then the next version of Bot Manager, we're very excited about that because that'll provide even better capabilities to stop the people trying – checking stolen IDs, and there's a ton of stolen IDs out there today. Then on the enterprise side, we're really just getting started in the market. There's two security products there. We're in the market selling Enterprise Application Access today. That was released in Q4. And we're in beta now with Enterprise Threat Protector, and that will become more generally available this summer. So there's a lot of new activity and products and innovation on the security side of the house and I'm very optimistic for continued very strong growth rates in our Security business. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks for the color. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on that last question regarding the Security business. I'm just curious, do you feel that your security products in aggregate are growing at market rates or potentially above? And to that point, what's the ability to sustain that? It looks like – well, it shouldn't look like. When I look at the new product that are coming out, I'm just curious, are those – in the security segment – are those anticipated to sustain the glide path, if you will, in terms of deceleration in growth that we're seeing? Or is there risk of a more prominent step down? And I guess, the reason I'm asking this is that with the Media business being weak or weaker than anticipated, obviously, the Security business has really been what's supported that. And it's difficult I think for all of us to really explicitly quantify exactly what that growth deceleration is going to look like. I think any color that could help us in that regard would be helpful. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. Let me start with that. It depends on who you want to compare to, but I think for most all choices our growth rate in our security solutions is very strong compared to the competition. The traditional competition there is we have box providers and that just doesn't cut it anymore when you have the scale of attacks being so large that you can easily overwhelm the data center defenses. In fact, you can't afford to buy enough boxes to defend yourself against the large-scale attacks. In addition, we're now, as we talked about, just getting into the area of enterprise security. And just so I'm clear about that, almost all of our revenue today comes from what I would call web security or application security, and that's defending websites and defending web apps against things like DDoS attacks or site takeover attacks, that kind of thing. With our new enterprise line, we're now going to be defending enterprise users and the enterprise network against attacks like phishing attacks, malware attacks, attacks where maybe some device has been infected in the enterprise. The bad guys have gathered up all the internal data and now they're going to exfiltrate it. And we're going to be stopping those kinds of attacks. So really it sounds like security still and it is, but it's by our different capabilities and in the long run, a much larger market for us. So I do think that we have every opportunity to maintain a very strong growth rate in our Security business as it gets larger. We don't provide forward-looking guidance. We will keep you advised on how the new enterprise line is doing once it gets some critical mass. But I'm very optimistic about the future, very strong growth of our security products. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC I guess, maybe just one other question. You made three acquisitions in the second half of 2017: Concord, Cyberfend, and Soha. I think you mentioned that ex FX and ex the top six customers, growth was 13% year-over-year. Can you give us like what's the organic growth? Is it fair to assume maybe 1% or 2% of that was a result of those acquisitions? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No, because Concord was just a handful of people with technology we really like, a very small acquisition. Cyberfend has not yet been integrated. As I talked about, we'll be releasing capabilities with the next version of Bot Manager this summer with Cyberfend technology. And Soha, we're just getting started their (46:23) sales. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Colby, there was really no revenue for any of those. Those were more technology tuck-ins. There's certainly some revenue that comes with SOASTA, as I mentioned, but the first three that you mentioned really were more of technology capability acquisitions. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thanks. Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, hi, Tom, Jim. I have a question on your overseas business and also back here in the States. The strength you're seeing overseas is a bit counterintuitive. I mean several equipment suppliers we track have noted weak demand trends especially in Europe. So is emerging markets primarily driving the strength you're seeing overseas? And then back here in the States, any of your big media customers kind of indicating to you they've increased their OTT programming volumes through the Akamai network heading into the back half or into next year? Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. No, you're absolutely right about the international growth, that the growth rates are very different in the European markets than the Asia Pacific markets. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're seeing very, very strong growth in the Asia Pacific markets. We are not seeing nearly the same level of growth in the European markets, but we have pretty good growth rates also in Europe. They're not the same as in Asia Pacific, but I'd say international growth rates at 21%, heavily fueled by Asia Pacific with decent growth in EMEA. And that's probably not uncommon. We certainly have more opportunity in our Asia Pacific markets where we're not nearly penetrated. And you could take the OTT question. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. I think when you talk to the leading executives, I think they are more bought in than ever that a lot of the video content is going to move over the top. And I think the approach they're taking now is to try lots of different vehicles. A typical broadcaster might have their own OTT offer for their content and they might participate in several aggregated packages. And I think at this point, they don't really know which ones will be the most successful. So I think they're trying a variety of alternatives with the idea being that one way or another, a lot of the content is going to move online. And they don't want to get caught short making the wrong bet, so they're trying lots of the alternatives. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Perfect. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Kelleher of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Want to get back to the media side. Is there a steady-state level of revenue for Internet platform customers? Or does that go right to zero? Does that $51 million level out somewhere? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. I mean, I think at the end of the day, it's tough to tell what's going to happen with the Internet platform customers that we certainly know that two of them have an intention to serve more of the traffic themselves. So as we said over the last couple quarters, we expect those two customers to continue to serve more traffic themselves which means less traffic will be served by Akamai. I think it's more difficult to call some of the other large Internet platform companies. Many of them have a culture of wanting to do more themselves. They do a lot with us today. I think it's really a matter of the use case and the capabilities that we possess. And if the capabilities we possess match the use case that they have and they don't have that capability, then we will continue to grow with them. So the reason we ring-fence them for you is because I think that investors have their own views of what's going to happen with those large companies. And I think it's difficult to call. I think that what we've tried to kind of provide some guidance on for you is that our expectation is they will continue to decline kind of over time here. So I don't know if they're going to go to zero, but I'm not sure we're ready to call that yet. But we expect that they're certainly going to continue to go down. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. And as a follow-up to that, if your other media customers are a little – the gaming sector are little slower, where do you stand with capacity utilization? And can you pull back on CapEx because you've got less media revenue to support? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. To be clear, media traffic is growing at a substantial rate. So we are continuing to build out. And of course, OTT traffic is growing at a substantial rate. So it's not a situation of underutilization. It's just that the growth rates, as a percentage, are less than they were before, of course, led by the largest platform companies. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. So you're not adjusting your CapEx for short-term weakness? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No, I think we always plan our CapEx in alignment with where we believe traffic growth is going to be. And I think, as Tom said, traffic is still growing very rapidly; it's just not growing as rapid a pace as we had projected. So, yes, we will dial CapEx in alignment with our revised projections, but we need to continue to build out as traffic grows and we don't have CapEx just for our Media business that while our Media business is certainly the most CapEx intensive that we do build our CapEx, as I mentioned, with our rapidly growing Security business, we're building out more attack capacity for Prolexic. And so there is a level of investment that's going on in CapEx. Even though security is not heavily CapEx-oriented business, it does have some CapEx. The other thing is, as we continue to make investments in R&D, we're going to capitalize more R&D, which is basically new product incubation. So there's a bunch of areas of CapEx many of which will continue to grow. Our expectation is that we'll manage CapEx and align it with traffic and revenue projections. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. All right. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is open. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey, guys. Good evening. I have two questions. So first is on a comment about EBITDA margins possibly dipping down in the second half below 37%. Is that just a function of lower topline? Or is it higher expenses? And then the second question is, given the what sounds like a worse at least medium-term market on the gaming side, do you feel like you're still in a position to get Media back to double-digits and the company back to double-digit overall by 2018? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I'll take those and then Tom may, if he has anything else to offer. So we're not guiding necessarily, Michael, for the back half. I did signal that because I think you know that EBITDA is a function of a lot of things, revenue and volumes being the most notable. And as I mentioned that there are important investments that we believe we need to make that are in the best interest of the company and our shareholders long-term, which are investments in some of the enterprise areas, some of the security areas, some of the areas that we mentioned that are going to be very significant we believe top line and bottom line growers. And so we don't want to curtail investment there. And so my caution for the back half was more that we're going to continue to make investments, and should you continue to see a top line moderation in Media, and again we don't know whether that's going to be the case. I think we're really talking about Media in particular. I was just being cautious that if we do dip below 37%, I wanted to make sure that people realize our intention is to manage the company to 37% to 39% EBITDA. There may be a quarter or two where you go through something lower than that, but we'll manage it back accordingly. And I forgot what your second question was? Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Double-digit growth? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. So we certainly have the expectation that we're going to return to double-digit growth in 2018. That's still where we believe we can be. You're right with the moderation in media that I don't believe this moderation in media is going to be a long-term phenomenon. So we may be going through a spell here for the next couple quarters where media growth softens. But, as you know, we've been through these periods before and then media growth roars again. So I think there's enough opportunity in media that we can get media growing again and get the company back to double digits. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks, guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Hart of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. There have been a bunch of questions about the Media Division, but I'd like to throw in just one more. This quarter we saw the media customer revenue growth outperform the Media Delivery product growth for orders of that trend (55:46). And wondering does that mean that your customers are buying Performance and Security offerings more than buying traditional Media Delivery offerings. And if that is the case, can you provide some more color on what solutions those customers are purchasing Performance and Security products for? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I would say that the media customers are certainly buying Performance products, especially Security. But they would not be buying more of that than the media products. The large majority of the Media Division revenue comes from our media products. And the large majority of the revenue is from those that have the most media to deliver. The largest several hundred customers would comprise a lot of the revenue. And those folks are big names. And so they really care about their brand. They are big targets for attack, and they care a lot about our security solutions. And so that is why you see the Media Division or the customer revenue for our media customers be growing at a higher rate than the media products per se. Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Thank you. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the question. If we take a step back, what would we have to see in terms of the growth rates that you're seeing in the business that would cause you guys to maybe dial back on the investments? Is there a certain level of growth that you want to sustain? Or what would you have to see to cause you guys to potentially pare back on the incremental investments on the Enterprise and Security side? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I mean, I would say that we manage the company as a portfolio and we look at all the investments that we want to make in product areas and what we believe kind of the return on investment is going to be for each one of them. And as Tom said in his prepared remarks, that our Performance, Security, and Enterprise offerings, have 50% EBITDAs even with the investments that we've been making. And so the Media business goes through spells like this, and what ends up happening is when the Media business goes through a softening, it does pressure near-term margins for the company. I can remind you of a couple years ago when the Media business was growing significantly. You see margin expansion happen very, very rapidly. That's a bit of the nature of the Media business. And so it wouldn't be wise for us to curtail investments in the business because of some short-term disruption in Media growth rates. I don't think that would be in the best interest of our shareholders or the company. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yeah. No, we certainly saw that in 2014 when the Media business was growing north of 20%. So definitely your point's well taken there. If I can just sneak one more on the Media business. If we could get more explicit on the sources of competition, to what extent are you seeing incremental competition from the public cloud providers, AWS, and that cohort versus your (59:11) competitors and then maybe potentially more of the private guys, more of the private Silicon Valley startups? Is there any one group that's being more aggressive than the other? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No. I think when it comes to that Media business, it's aggressive across the board with the entities that you just talked about. And it's been that way for a long, long time. In fact, one group you didn't mention that you would have three to five years ago is the carrier. The carriers were aggressively competing with us three to five years ago or in the past and now they're mostly standardized on Akamai's capabilities. But I think we'll continue to see competition from startups, from the traditional players, and from the cloud providers. And we fare well against the competition, especially in situations where quality matters. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Understood. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yeah, hi. Thank you for the question. I actually had two of them. One was related to OTT. And I was just wondering what's the potential for the players that are trying to get big in OTT to generate the same problem down the road that you're having with the big platform providers today where the biggest companies who get all the subs end up investing to do this themselves. Like, what are you hearing from them? Is there anything you could share with us to help maybe mitigate those fears since OTT is one of your drivers that you're holding out? And then the second thing was just your comments about the carriers. In particular, can you share with us with the transition to these unlimited data plans and people forcing if you use those to go from HD to SD quality and obviously, the size of those files then becomes smaller. How do we think about that having any positive or neutral or negative impact on the growth that you're seeing through the network? Thank you. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Okay. The first question on are we worried about the big broadcasters as they start their own services and grow and so forth, doing more themselves? I don't think so. I think it's going in the other direction. Generally speaking, those folks are taking, doing less in-house maybe than they did before. I think they've recognized this is not their core area of expertise and doing more outsourcing going forward. So I don't see that's an issue. Obviously, these giant platform companies, most of those guys spend billions of dollars a year in infrastructure. And they're just at a different scale where it becomes possible for them to think about spending hundreds of millions more, trying to do some content delivery. So I don't see that being an issue in terms of OTT going forward. If anything, it's going in the other direction. With the carriers, I think we're seeing actually the quality levels for video increase as opposed to a scenario you're describing where it would decrease. And there's competition there and their users, the end viewers, demand the higher-quality video as you get better devices into the home, I think just the opposite happens. You get higher quality levels and we see the carriers already experimenting with sort of super-high quality, which means more traffic. So that, I think, it's more likely to go that way then to lower quality levels. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of them from me. First on the gaming side, it seems to me the shift to background updates has been happening gradually. Was there a specific event or a specific customer that drove what seems to be a bit more – it feels like the messaging is that this was a bit more sudden than I would perceive sort of the gradual shift to play out as. Any color there? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. I don't think there's any specific customer. And like you say, this shift has been taking place. And it's having an impact on traffic growth. So it's not one event, no. I think it's been a trend in the industry. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Okay. And then with respect to the Ions or the acceleration side, have you seen on renewals pricing – how would you describe pricing on renewals around Ion and acceleration pricing trends now, say, versus 12 months, 18 months ago? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. I think when you come to a renewal for the same product, they always want to lower price. On the other hand, maybe there's more traffic, which helps. And the best part is we've got a lot of new products. There's Image Manager, there's Bot Manager, there's the next generation of Ion focused on mobile, the next generation of Kona, again, focused on mobile. So there's more to bring to bear in the account, which helps us hold price or grow revenue in the base. And so we are seeing revenue growth in the base of customers with our Performance and Security products. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC And how about the actual net customer count growth? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. We don't actually report customer count. We have done that for some time. So really not much to comment there. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Okay. And then, I guess, just one last one. Just a clarification. You commented on expenses being a bit above the expectations on the back of higher commissions and more aggressive hiring. Both seem a bit counterintuitive given the business trends. Can you just expand a bit on those? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Well, actually, we performed well in Q1. So it shouldn't be surprising that commissions then would be a little bit higher. And relative to my comment about getting recruiting related spend that as I mentioned, last year was a period where hiring was a pretty low period for the company. And our expectation is we're going to step up hiring a bit more this year and so we incurred more kind of recruiting-related spend in the first quarter than we expected, which means we moved a little bit faster than we thought we could. So those are really the two big drivers. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Thank you, Jeff. So, I think, operator we have time for one more. I know we are running little bit long. So want to be cognizant of that. So maybe we will take one more question. Operator Yes, sir. Our last question is from Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, one more on the Media Solutions category. Can you give us the split between gaming, video, social and software downloads? And then what are your expectations for some of the new services coming out? I mean, Hulu, potentially Comcast products, potentially Verizon product. For those companies that already have a CDN capability, would you expect that traffic to continue to go to you guys or would they have that traffic on their own platform or it might be a hybrid of both? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Okay. So I'll take those. A lot of the business is video and a lot of it is software downloads. Now gaming, most of the gaming business today is software downloads, just in the gaming vertical. We don't give out the splits, but both are significant sources of traffic and revenue for us. On your comment around Hulu, Comcast and Verizon, the answer is it depends. With Comcast, they have their own delivery mechanism for their own networks. So to get to their own subscribers, they may use their own delivery network. We also have many Akamai Edge servers within the Comcast networks. So we deliver a lot of content to Comcast users as well. Same with Verizon. Verizon has a competing offer, but we deliver a lot of content within Verizon's network. You take a Hulu, that's more of a direct aggregator of content and that's a situation where Akamai would be in a good position to deliver their content. And even in cases where there's a big content provider that maybe is in the same parent company with a big network, even if they have their own capability to deliver in their network, you might well see us doing the delivery of the content for that content provider. Generally speaking, there's a couple of exceptions. But generally speaking, a lot of the video delivery that's done, especially live or for-pay content, we'll be doing that today. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at a number of investor events in May and June in both the Americas and in EMEA and details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. So thank you for joining us, and have a wonderful evening. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participation in today's conference. This concludes your program. You may now disconnect.

Our first question is from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I think the first question that really jumps to mind is the Investor Summit wasn't that long ago and it really feels like there's a change in tone around the Media business. When did that become apparent? Was it apparent earlier in the quarter and you just wanted to focus on the high level of the investment summit (sic) [Investor Summit] (28:54) or is this something that you were expecting better volumes at the end of the quarter type of thing? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah, let me start with, we are very bullish on the Media business. So that has not changed. Nothing has changed about what we believe are the growth prospects for the Media business. Relative to our Investor Summit is that what we did see is that we did see traffic growth moderate, as I mentioned in the Americas region in particular and very notably in our gaming vertical and it moderated throughout the quarter. So it was relatively strong in January and then it moderated in February and then it moderated further in March. And that was really the driver of kind of, I would say, missing our internal expectations. But I'd say we are very, very optimistic about the Media business long-term. And as we said to you guys before, the nature of the Media business is it does go through periods where traffic spikes, traffic softens at times. But over the long-term, we think this is a very good business and it will be a very good grower for the company. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC And then maybe one follow-up question. Can you help us parse maybe the data this way? You give us the geographic and we see the North America weakness in the comments that you made. But if you were to split the platform, the big six out from that, what did North American growth look like, just so we can kind of go to the non-big six in North America to understand what's happening there. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. Well, you got to be careful because the Americas also includes our Media customers as well as our Web customers. I think Americas' growth, if you exclude the large Internet platform customers, was roughly 10%. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from James Breen of William Blair. Your line is open. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC Thanks. Just a couple questions. One, the guidance for next quarter. As you look at that number, approximately SOASTA closed in the beginning of the quarter and I think you had said to be about $20 million of revenues. Is that included in that guidance number just comparing that relative to where consensus is? And then on the big six, you obviously saw pretty good absolute step down in the first quarter from the fourth quarter and the third quarter last year. Is there anything in there that's seasonal in that? And then as you see think about your largest customers now, how big are your top two or three customers as a percentage of revenue? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. So I think the large Internet platform customers for the most part came in line with what we expected in Q1. They do seasonally drop Q4 to Q1. That Q4 seasonally is a large quarter for all – actually, all of our large media customers in particular. So the step down there was not unexpected, pretty much in line with what we thought. Those customers now represent about 8% of our revenues. So the good news is that as we go through this, the diversification of the company's revenue, as I mentioned in the Investor Summit, we are much better diversified from a customer perspective; we're much better diversified from a product category perspective; and we're much better diversified from a geography perspective. So I think the health and diversification of the company's revenue is much better now than it has been. And I think relative to the giants and maybe what we expect them to do kind of longer-term, I think as we've said before, we do expect a further deceleration with two of those six. And we expect them to further kind of decline as they serve more of their traffic themselves. So nothing there has really changed and what we've seen here is very much in line with our expectations. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC And then just on the guidance side, so that guidance will include some portion of the SOASTA revenue since the deal closed in April? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. Yeah. As I said, we're not going to guide specifically on SOASTA's revenues and margins. I said at the Investor Summit that SOASTA probably will generate, call it, roughly $20 million for the remainder of 2017. It could be a little bit less than that. But what you're going to have in the first quarter with SOASTA is, as you know, with purchase accounting, we're going to take a very large deferred revenue haircut. So the revenue in the second quarter will certainly be less than and it will be in the third and the fourth quarter. So it's not that material. We're going to embed that in our Web performance business and we're going to report that within our Performance and Security category. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC And just, finally, just as you look across the division, it seems as though performance and security continue to perform well. So really the weakness we're seeing is mainly in the media side. Around that gaming vertical, is it multiple players? Is it one or two players that you're seeing having the most pressure? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. There's a lot of competition in media and I would say especially when it comes to software downloads, which is where the revenue comes from the gaming vertical. And as the traffic shifts more towards updates that can be done in the background as opposed to a new game where you're sitting there waiting for it in real time, well, that means performance matters less, means pricing is lower, and competition is even stiffer. And we've talked about that before. And I think that's part of what we're seeing here. But there's lots of competition in media, particularly for software downloads and especially if it's in a background kind of mode. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. And, Jim, your comment about Performance and Security, it continues to be a very strong growth for the company. The 18% growth in Q1, last year it consistently grew kind of in the high-teens. So what you see here really is just a little softening in media growth kind of in our Americas region and in the area that we mentioned. Again, this tends to be the nature of the Media business. And I think we've gone through these spells before where media surges and you start to see media accelerate. So it's not uncommon to go through these periods. But I believe we're optimistic about the long-term growth potential, not just for OTT, but also within gaming. That as gaming becomes more and more latency sensitive and performance sensitive, as you see more and more things like AR and VR that, I think, that all of a sudden, the differentiation for Akamai becomes more and more apparent. So we're bullish about the prospects for media. I think we're going to go through some near-term slowing in media, but optimistic about the long-term for media. James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC Terrific. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Will Power of Baird. Your line is open. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. We'll move to the next question, please. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Great, guys. Could you give us maybe some color on your Media business percentage where you think you have kind of fairly differentiated services that are not as commodity like we're seeing on software here? And Jim, maybe just give maybe a little more clarity what you're seeing on the guidance on the Media side, how much it'd be down sequentially? Maybe I kind of missed that. But it seems like I'm having a tough time getting to that type of overall revenue guidance that you're providing for the second quarter. Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I'm not sure what else to tell you about the guidance. We don't guide necessarily by product category that our media products were about 3% growth kind of excluding the large Internet platform customers. And our Media Division customer growth was about 10%. So we expect that to further moderate to the areas that I mentioned, which is in the Americas and notably within gaming. We do expect to have continued strong growth in Performance and Security, continue to expect to have good growth within Services. So I think what you're going to see here in the guide is you kind to do it at the midpoint. At the midpoint, you're going to see a further moderation of media growth rates and that's really kind of what it's all about. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. And on Media, can you maybe give us some color on what do you think is more commoditized versus where you have more for a differentiated product? I mean, I think some of your OTT video was fairly unique in terms of quality and scale. Where you're at, at this point, in the business? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. No, I think you characterized it well. At one end of the spectrum, you've got background software downloads, which is not performance sensitive, and that's the best opportunity for competition. Obviously, pricing lower there as well. The other end of the spectrum, you've got live and linear OTT where performance is very sensitive, and it's very challenging to deliver high quality at scale. And you see the great work that we're doing there with the kinds of awards we win at NAB. We're the go-to player for the major events that you watch online and traffic growing well there. And I think really key for us is to see OTT adoption continue, even better if it accelerates, quality levels to improve as broadcasters move more content into the higher-quality formats, HD and someday, 4K. Those are all very good areas for Akamai. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Siti Panigrahi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi. Just switching to Security business. Security this time grew around 35.5% year-over-year. That's a deceleration from last year of 47% and even Q4 of 41%. I'm wondering, for the remaining of the year, I know you don't guide, but are you expecting any kind of new product that's coming in contributing, because if I look at your 2015 to 2016, it decelerated from 49% to 44%. But as you look 2017, what's your expectation in terms of trends and contribution from the newer products? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. Well, let me start and then I can have – Tom can talk a little about the products. I think you're right that the growth rates in Security were in the kind of the high-40%s and then the low-40%s and now they're in the high 30%s. This is a business that is now a annualized run rate of $450 million. Five years ago this was just a idea. So this business is growing very, very rapidly. Its growth rate on a percentage basis is lower because it's on a much, much bigger base. So we're very, very positive about the Security business and our execution in the Security business. And you've got to remember, this is all subscription model offerings. This is not license model. This is literally a subscription model business that now is approaching $0.5 billion. So Tom can talk a little bit about the product categories, but there's a lot going on there. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. I talked about in the prepared remarks that we have the new version of Kona out now, and that includes now protection for API end points. And the way to think about that is for your mobile apps where as you have more mobile apps deployed, the attackers are now going after those and we have a really unique capability to very nicely defend against those. You have the new version of Bot Manager, and that manages the response given to the automated entities that are coming to your websites and apps. There's a wide variety of those. I guess, price scrapers and account takeover attacks being maybe the worst there. And as I talked about with our new machine learning capabilities to be deployed this summer and then the next version of Bot Manager, we're very excited about that because that'll provide even better capabilities to stop the people trying – checking stolen IDs, and there's a ton of stolen IDs out there today. Then on the enterprise side, we're really just getting started in the market. There's two security products there. We're in the market selling Enterprise Application Access today. That was released in Q4. And we're in beta now with Enterprise Threat Protector, and that will become more generally available this summer. So there's a lot of new activity and products and innovation on the security side of the house and I'm very optimistic for continued very strong growth rates in our Security business. Siti Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks for the color. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on that last question regarding the Security business. I'm just curious, do you feel that your security products in aggregate are growing at market rates or potentially above? And to that point, what's the ability to sustain that? It looks like – well, it shouldn't look like. When I look at the new product that are coming out, I'm just curious, are those – in the security segment – are those anticipated to sustain the glide path, if you will, in terms of deceleration in growth that we're seeing? Or is there risk of a more prominent step down? And I guess, the reason I'm asking this is that with the Media business being weak or weaker than anticipated, obviously, the Security business has really been what's supported that. And it's difficult I think for all of us to really explicitly quantify exactly what that growth deceleration is going to look like. I think any color that could help us in that regard would be helpful. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. Let me start with that. It depends on who you want to compare to, but I think for most all choices our growth rate in our security solutions is very strong compared to the competition. The traditional competition there is we have box providers and that just doesn't cut it anymore when you have the scale of attacks being so large that you can easily overwhelm the data center defenses. In fact, you can't afford to buy enough boxes to defend yourself against the large-scale attacks. In addition, we're now, as we talked about, just getting into the area of enterprise security. And just so I'm clear about that, almost all of our revenue today comes from what I would call web security or application security, and that's defending websites and defending web apps against things like DDoS attacks or site takeover attacks, that kind of thing. With our new enterprise line, we're now going to be defending enterprise users and the enterprise network against attacks like phishing attacks, malware attacks, attacks where maybe some device has been infected in the enterprise. The bad guys have gathered up all the internal data and now they're going to exfiltrate it. And we're going to be stopping those kinds of attacks. So really it sounds like security still and it is, but it's by our different capabilities and in the long run, a much larger market for us. So I do think that we have every opportunity to maintain a very strong growth rate in our Security business as it gets larger. We don't provide forward-looking guidance. We will keep you advised on how the new enterprise line is doing once it gets some critical mass. But I'm very optimistic about the future, very strong growth of our security products. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC I guess, maybe just one other question. You made three acquisitions in the second half of 2017: Concord, Cyberfend, and Soha. I think you mentioned that ex FX and ex the top six customers, growth was 13% year-over-year. Can you give us like what's the organic growth? Is it fair to assume maybe 1% or 2% of that was a result of those acquisitions? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No, because Concord was just a handful of people with technology we really like, a very small acquisition. Cyberfend has not yet been integrated. As I talked about, we'll be releasing capabilities with the next version of Bot Manager this summer with Cyberfend technology. And Soha, we're just getting started their (46:23) sales. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Colby, there was really no revenue for any of those. Those were more technology tuck-ins. There's certainly some revenue that comes with SOASTA, as I mentioned, but the first three that you mentioned really were more of technology capability acquisitions. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thanks. Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, hi, Tom, Jim. I have a question on your overseas business and also back here in the States. The strength you're seeing overseas is a bit counterintuitive. I mean several equipment suppliers we track have noted weak demand trends especially in Europe. So is emerging markets primarily driving the strength you're seeing overseas? And then back here in the States, any of your big media customers kind of indicating to you they've increased their OTT programming volumes through the Akamai network heading into the back half or into next year? Thanks. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. No, you're absolutely right about the international growth, that the growth rates are very different in the European markets than the Asia Pacific markets. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're seeing very, very strong growth in the Asia Pacific markets. We are not seeing nearly the same level of growth in the European markets, but we have pretty good growth rates also in Europe. They're not the same as in Asia Pacific, but I'd say international growth rates at 21%, heavily fueled by Asia Pacific with decent growth in EMEA. And that's probably not uncommon. We certainly have more opportunity in our Asia Pacific markets where we're not nearly penetrated. And you could take the OTT question. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yes. I think when you talk to the leading executives, I think they are more bought in than ever that a lot of the video content is going to move over the top. And I think the approach they're taking now is to try lots of different vehicles. A typical broadcaster might have their own OTT offer for their content and they might participate in several aggregated packages. And I think at this point, they don't really know which ones will be the most successful. So I think they're trying a variety of alternatives with the idea being that one way or another, a lot of the content is going to move online. And they don't want to get caught short making the wrong bet, so they're trying lots of the alternatives. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Perfect. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Kelleher of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Want to get back to the media side. Is there a steady-state level of revenue for Internet platform customers? Or does that go right to zero? Does that $51 million level out somewhere? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. I mean, I think at the end of the day, it's tough to tell what's going to happen with the Internet platform customers that we certainly know that two of them have an intention to serve more of the traffic themselves. So as we said over the last couple quarters, we expect those two customers to continue to serve more traffic themselves which means less traffic will be served by Akamai. I think it's more difficult to call some of the other large Internet platform companies. Many of them have a culture of wanting to do more themselves. They do a lot with us today. I think it's really a matter of the use case and the capabilities that we possess. And if the capabilities we possess match the use case that they have and they don't have that capability, then we will continue to grow with them. So the reason we ring-fence them for you is because I think that investors have their own views of what's going to happen with those large companies. And I think it's difficult to call. I think that what we've tried to kind of provide some guidance on for you is that our expectation is they will continue to decline kind of over time here. So I don't know if they're going to go to zero, but I'm not sure we're ready to call that yet. But we expect that they're certainly going to continue to go down. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. And as a follow-up to that, if your other media customers are a little – the gaming sector are little slower, where do you stand with capacity utilization? And can you pull back on CapEx because you've got less media revenue to support? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. To be clear, media traffic is growing at a substantial rate. So we are continuing to build out. And of course, OTT traffic is growing at a substantial rate. So it's not a situation of underutilization. It's just that the growth rates, as a percentage, are less than they were before, of course, led by the largest platform companies. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. So you're not adjusting your CapEx for short-term weakness? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No, I think we always plan our CapEx in alignment with where we believe traffic growth is going to be. And I think, as Tom said, traffic is still growing very rapidly; it's just not growing as rapid a pace as we had projected. So, yes, we will dial CapEx in alignment with our revised projections, but we need to continue to build out as traffic grows and we don't have CapEx just for our Media business that while our Media business is certainly the most CapEx intensive that we do build our CapEx, as I mentioned, with our rapidly growing Security business, we're building out more attack capacity for Prolexic. And so there is a level of investment that's going on in CapEx. Even though security is not heavily CapEx-oriented business, it does have some CapEx. The other thing is, as we continue to make investments in R&D, we're going to capitalize more R&D, which is basically new product incubation. So there's a bunch of areas of CapEx many of which will continue to grow. Our expectation is that we'll manage CapEx and align it with traffic and revenue projections. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co. All right. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Your line is open. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey, guys. Good evening. I have two questions. So first is on a comment about EBITDA margins possibly dipping down in the second half below 37%. Is that just a function of lower topline? Or is it higher expenses? And then the second question is, given the what sounds like a worse at least medium-term market on the gaming side, do you feel like you're still in a position to get Media back to double-digits and the company back to double-digit overall by 2018? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I'll take those and then Tom may, if he has anything else to offer. So we're not guiding necessarily, Michael, for the back half. I did signal that because I think you know that EBITDA is a function of a lot of things, revenue and volumes being the most notable. And as I mentioned that there are important investments that we believe we need to make that are in the best interest of the company and our shareholders long-term, which are investments in some of the enterprise areas, some of the security areas, some of the areas that we mentioned that are going to be very significant we believe top line and bottom line growers. And so we don't want to curtail investment there. And so my caution for the back half was more that we're going to continue to make investments, and should you continue to see a top line moderation in Media, and again we don't know whether that's going to be the case. I think we're really talking about Media in particular. I was just being cautious that if we do dip below 37%, I wanted to make sure that people realize our intention is to manage the company to 37% to 39% EBITDA. There may be a quarter or two where you go through something lower than that, but we'll manage it back accordingly. And I forgot what your second question was? Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Double-digit growth? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. So we certainly have the expectation that we're going to return to double-digit growth in 2018. That's still where we believe we can be. You're right with the moderation in media that I don't believe this moderation in media is going to be a long-term phenomenon. So we may be going through a spell here for the next couple quarters where media growth softens. But, as you know, we've been through these periods before and then media growth roars again. So I think there's enough opportunity in media that we can get media growing again and get the company back to double digits. Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks, guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Hart of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. There have been a bunch of questions about the Media Division, but I'd like to throw in just one more. This quarter we saw the media customer revenue growth outperform the Media Delivery product growth for orders of that trend (55:46). And wondering does that mean that your customers are buying Performance and Security offerings more than buying traditional Media Delivery offerings. And if that is the case, can you provide some more color on what solutions those customers are purchasing Performance and Security products for? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I would say that the media customers are certainly buying Performance products, especially Security. But they would not be buying more of that than the media products. The large majority of the Media Division revenue comes from our media products. And the large majority of the revenue is from those that have the most media to deliver. The largest several hundred customers would comprise a lot of the revenue. And those folks are big names. And so they really care about their brand. They are big targets for attack, and they care a lot about our security solutions. And so that is why you see the Media Division or the customer revenue for our media customers be growing at a higher rate than the media products per se. Michael Hart - Guggenheim Securities Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Thank you. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the question. If we take a step back, what would we have to see in terms of the growth rates that you're seeing in the business that would cause you guys to maybe dial back on the investments? Is there a certain level of growth that you want to sustain? Or what would you have to see to cause you guys to potentially pare back on the incremental investments on the Enterprise and Security side? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Yeah. I mean, I would say that we manage the company as a portfolio and we look at all the investments that we want to make in product areas and what we believe kind of the return on investment is going to be for each one of them. And as Tom said in his prepared remarks, that our Performance, Security, and Enterprise offerings, have 50% EBITDAs even with the investments that we've been making. And so the Media business goes through spells like this, and what ends up happening is when the Media business goes through a softening, it does pressure near-term margins for the company. I can remind you of a couple years ago when the Media business was growing significantly. You see margin expansion happen very, very rapidly. That's a bit of the nature of the Media business. And so it wouldn't be wise for us to curtail investments in the business because of some short-term disruption in Media growth rates. I don't think that would be in the best interest of our shareholders or the company. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yeah. No, we certainly saw that in 2014 when the Media business was growing north of 20%. So definitely your point's well taken there. If I can just sneak one more on the Media business. If we could get more explicit on the sources of competition, to what extent are you seeing incremental competition from the public cloud providers, AWS, and that cohort versus your (59:11) competitors and then maybe potentially more of the private guys, more of the private Silicon Valley startups? Is there any one group that's being more aggressive than the other? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. No. I think when it comes to that Media business, it's aggressive across the board with the entities that you just talked about. And it's been that way for a long, long time. In fact, one group you didn't mention that you would have three to five years ago is the carrier. The carriers were aggressively competing with us three to five years ago or in the past and now they're mostly standardized on Akamai's capabilities. But I think we'll continue to see competition from startups, from the traditional players, and from the cloud providers. And we fare well against the competition, especially in situations where quality matters. Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Understood. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yeah, hi. Thank you for the question. I actually had two of them. One was related to OTT. And I was just wondering what's the potential for the players that are trying to get big in OTT to generate the same problem down the road that you're having with the big platform providers today where the biggest companies who get all the subs end up investing to do this themselves. Like, what are you hearing from them? Is there anything you could share with us to help maybe mitigate those fears since OTT is one of your drivers that you're holding out? And then the second thing was just your comments about the carriers. In particular, can you share with us with the transition to these unlimited data plans and people forcing if you use those to go from HD to SD quality and obviously, the size of those files then becomes smaller. How do we think about that having any positive or neutral or negative impact on the growth that you're seeing through the network? Thank you. James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Okay. The first question on are we worried about the big broadcasters as they start their own services and grow and so forth, doing more themselves? I don't think so. I think it's going in the other direction. Generally speaking, those folks are taking, doing less in-house maybe than they did before. I think they've recognized this is not their core area of expertise and doing more outsourcing going forward. So I don't see that's an issue. Obviously, these giant platform companies, most of those guys spend billions of dollars a year in infrastructure. And they're just at a different scale where it becomes possible for them to think about spending hundreds of millions more, trying to do some content delivery. So I don't see that being an issue in terms of OTT going forward. If anything, it's going in the other direction. With the carriers, I think we're seeing actually the quality levels for video increase as opposed to a scenario you're describing where it would decrease. And there's competition there and their users, the end viewers, demand the higher-quality video as you get better devices into the home, I think just the opposite happens. You get higher quality levels and we see the carriers already experimenting with sort of super-high quality, which means more traffic. So that, I think, it's more likely to go that way then to lower quality levels. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of them from me. First on the gaming side, it seems to me the shift to background updates has been happening gradually. Was there a specific event or a specific customer that drove what seems to be a bit more – it feels like the messaging is that this was a bit more sudden than I would perceive sort of the gradual shift to play out as. Any color there? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. I don't think there's any specific customer. And like you say, this shift has been taking place. And it's having an impact on traffic growth. So it's not one event, no. I think it's been a trend in the industry. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Okay. And then with respect to the Ions or the acceleration side, have you seen on renewals pricing – how would you describe pricing on renewals around Ion and acceleration pricing trends now, say, versus 12 months, 18 months ago? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. I think when you come to a renewal for the same product, they always want to lower price. On the other hand, maybe there's more traffic, which helps. And the best part is we've got a lot of new products. There's Image Manager, there's Bot Manager, there's the next generation of Ion focused on mobile, the next generation of Kona, again, focused on mobile. So there's more to bring to bear in the account, which helps us hold price or grow revenue in the base. And so we are seeing revenue growth in the base of customers with our Performance and Security products. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC And how about the actual net customer count growth? James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc. We don't actually report customer count. We have done that for some time. So really not much to comment there. Jeff Van Rhee - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Okay. And then, I guess, just one last one. Just a clarification. You commented on expenses being a bit above the expectations on the back of higher commissions and more aggressive hiring. Both seem a bit counterintuitive given the business trends. Can you just expand a bit on those? Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Well, actually, we performed well in Q1. So it shouldn't be surprising that commissions then would be a little bit higher. And relative to my comment about getting recruiting related spend that as I mentioned, last year was a period where hiring was a pretty low period for the company. And our expectation is we're going to step up hiring a bit more this year and so we incurred more kind of recruiting-related spend in the first quarter than we expected, which means we moved a little bit faster than we thought we could. So those are really the two big drivers. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Thank you, Jeff. So, I think, operator we have time for one more. I know we are running little bit long. So want to be cognizant of that. So maybe we will take one more question. Operator Yes, sir. Our last question is from Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Brandon Nispel - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, one more on the Media Solutions category. Can you give us the split between gaming, video, social and software downloads? And then what are your expectations for some of the new services coming out? I mean, Hulu, potentially Comcast products, potentially Verizon product. For those companies that already have a CDN capability, would you expect that traffic to continue to go to you guys or would they have that traffic on their own platform or it might be a hybrid of both? Thanks. Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Okay. So I'll take those. A lot of the business is video and a lot of it is software downloads. Now gaming, most of the gaming business today is software downloads, just in the gaming vertical. We don't give out the splits, but both are significant sources of traffic and revenue for us. On your comment around Hulu, Comcast and Verizon, the answer is it depends. With Comcast, they have their own delivery mechanism for their own networks. So to get to their own subscribers, they may use their own delivery network. We also have many Akamai Edge servers within the Comcast networks. So we deliver a lot of content to Comcast users as well. Same with Verizon. Verizon has a competing offer, but we deliver a lot of content within Verizon's network. You take a Hulu, that's more of a direct aggregator of content and that's a situation where Akamai would be in a good position to deliver their content. And even in cases where there's a big content provider that maybe is in the same parent company with a big network, even if they have their own capability to deliver in their network, you might well see us doing the delivery of the content for that content provider. Generally speaking, there's a couple of exceptions. But generally speaking, a lot of the video delivery that's done, especially live or for-pay content, we'll be doing that today. Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at a number of investor events in May and June in both the Americas and in EMEA and details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. So thank you for joining us, and have a wonderful evening. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participation in today's conference. This concludes your program. You may now disconnect.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson. Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc. Thanks, Mike. I'm happy to report that Applied Materials delivered another record quarter in Q1. With earnings and orders exceeding all-time highs, 2017 is shaping up to be an outstanding year. As I look ahead, I see broad-based strength in our markets as large multiyear inflections evolve and new emerging demand drivers layer on top of mobility and computing. I'm also increasingly confident that Applied is positioned to sustainably grow faster than our markets, as we realize the benefits of the investments we have been making in our organization and product pipeline. On today's call, I'll begin with a quick recap of our strategy and provide an update on the key trends and industry inflections that are driving our growth. I'll then translate these into an outlook for Applied's markets before concluding with a brief overview for each of our businesses. After that, Bob will provide additional details about our performance and his perspective on 2017 and beyond. The significant changes in semiconductor and display technology that are taking place today depend on materials innovation. At Applied, our strategy is to deliver innovative materials engineering technologies to enable these major inflections. Across the company, we are focused on extending our innovation leadership and delivering solutions that enable customers to build new devices and structures that were never possible before. As I've outlined previously, there are five large multiyear inflections that are underpinning our record performance today and we believe will fuel our growth for years to come. I'm going to take a few minutes to provide an update on each of these drivers as well as describe how our strategy of inflection-focused innovation positions Applied for sustainable profitable growth. Let me begin with 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies in foundry and logic. We are seeing significant investments by our customers to meet demand for leading-edge silicon to power increasingly capable mobile devices, 4K video, and new compute-intensive applications like artificial intelligence and smart vehicles. This sustained investment in advanced technology plays to the strengths of our leadership businesses, where we have unique capabilities and high market share. The second driver is 3D NAND, which is a great example of materials-enabled scaling. We believe NAND bit demand grew about 45% in 2016 and that 2017 will be similar. Major memory companies are saying this growth rate is sustainable over the next several years. Our opportunity in NAND is also expanding. While 3D NAND has significant performance and power advantages, the bit density increase achieved moving from generation to generation is slower than it was for planar NAND. To compensate, more wafer starts are needed. The third driver for Applied is patterning, a market which is growing rapidly. It's important to recognize that as customers move to smaller chip geometries, all the layers in the device scale. Some layers will move to EUV [Extreme Ultraviolet] and others to multi-patterning. This means that even in the most aggressive EUV adoption case, our patterning opportunity still expands considerably. Patterning is an area where Applied is making significant investments. We increased our patterning revenues more than 60% in 2016, and we have significant room to grow. Beyond semiconductor, another unique growth driver for Applied is advanced display, where two major market inflections are underway. The first is rapid growth in large-format TVs 60 inches and above, which is driving investment in new Gen 10.5 capacity as customers optimize factories for bigger screen sizes. We are now tracking seven Gen 10.5 projects. In parallel, there's a battle for leadership in next-generation mobile screens, and demand for our OLED manufacturing equipment is broadening. We see half of this demand coming from new entrants. As a result, in the past few months, our view of display spending has strengthened further. We now see customers increasing their investments by around $3 billion in 2017, $1 billion more than we thought in November. Our early view of 2018 is also positive. The fifth driver I'll cover is China, which is an important long-term growth opportunity for Applied in both semiconductor and display. While we believe 2017 spending will be similar to last year, based on the new factory projects we are tracking, we expect to see a significant ramp in investment in 2018 and beyond. Now, I'll translate these major inflections into our market outlook. Due to strong shipments in December, we now believe 2016 wafer fab equipment spending ended the year at around $35 billion. We expect 2017 to be higher still, up 5% or more year on year. Within this spending, we see strength across the board with foundry, NAND, DRAM, and logic investments all growing relative to 2016. Our early view of 2018 wafer fab equipment is also positive for a number of reasons. We see foundry investment broadening. We believe memory fundamentals will remain strong, fueled by explosive growth in data and investment in new technologies. When we look at customers' total capital spending, we see healthy investment in new factory shells, and we expect spending in China to accelerate in 2018 and beyond. Looking to the future, we're increasingly excited about trends in virtual and augmented reality, big data, and artificial intelligence and smart vehicles. These new applications require major advances in silicon and display technology and create huge demand for memory. These new drivers layer on top of existing demand for mobility, PCs, and other consumer electronics and have the potential to fuel a new phase of industry growth. All of this reinforces our perspective that our markets are becoming stronger and less cyclical. I'll now provide a brief update on each of our major businesses. In semiconductor, 2016 was a big share gain year for Applied. While we'll wait for Gartner's final sizing in April before providing all the details, we believe we have gained around 2 points of overall wafer fab equipment share. These gains are broad-based, with especially strong adoption of our new products. In 2016, about 40% of our revenue came from products that we've launched in the past three years. We have great momentum and fully expect to add to these gains in 2017. In our first quarter, semi equipment revenue and orders were at a 16-year high, with our highest orders ever in etch, CVD, and processed diagnostics and control. In display, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and orders. Since 2012, we have grown display revenues around 20% per year, and we believe we'll book $2 billion of orders in 2017. As display technology becomes more complex, we are focused on building out our product portfolio to deliver the solutions our customers need. We have great traction with our new thin film encapsulation and e-beam review products and have more significant new products that we'll announce later this year. In Service, our strategy is to deliver more value to customers with our advanced service products. We're focused on reducing ramp times, improving device performance and yield, and optimizing output and operating costs for our customers. We're seeing the impact of our investments and are increasing our share of the service opportunity. On a year-on-year basis, we've now grown our service business for 13 consecutive quarters, and our orders in Q1 were also an all-time high. Before I hand the call over to Bob, let me quickly summarize. Q1 was another record-breaking quarter, and we expect 2017 to be an outstanding year for the company. The large multiyear inflections that are driving our business remain firmly in place, and our markets are growing and becoming less cyclical. We expect wafer fab equipment and display investments to be up in 2017, and our initial view of 2018 is also positive. Our inflection-focused innovation strategy is delivering results. We are outperforming in semiconductor with strong share gains, sustainably growing our service business, and we are uniquely positioned to drive significant growth in display. Overall, we are increasingly confident that we can maintain our trajectory of sustainable growth and raise the ceiling on our performance. Now, I'll ask Bob to provide more details about our results and outlook. Bob? Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. Thanks, Gary. Applied's momentum continues in the new fiscal year, with record orders and earnings both up substantially from a year ago, and we're guiding for new revenue and earnings records in Q2. For investors with a long memory, this kind of performance raises old questions about peaks and sustainability. However, I'm confident that our markets are materially better, and I believe that Applied's ability to deliver value and profitability is increasingly stronger and more sustainable. Last quarter I gave you numbers showing that the industry is now larger and significantly less volatile. Some of you did the math and saw that this is true. I believe investors will come to recognize that the industry truly is more attractive, owing to three important factors. First is that our customers have fully absorbed a tremendous amount of productivity. The list includes: the 300-millimeter wafer size transition; cycle time reductions; supplier consolidation, including the IDM [Integrated Device Manufacturer] to foundry transition; the shift to highly productive mega-fabs; better inventory management; reuse strategies; and disciplined profit-minded investment by our customers. Second is capital intensity. A steadily rising amount of capital equipment is needed to build each type of chip, and customers increasingly need the kind of equipment Applied makes. For example, patterning smaller lines takes more CVD, CMP, and etch steps. Logic and foundry chips need more metal layers and new materials. And 3D NAND memories add bits at a slower rate than 2D shrinks. You can see these factors playing out in the capital intensity curves for the industry. Third is that we are seeing more demand drivers. In NAND, server farms are early in the transition from hard disks to solid-state drives. In logic and foundry, leading technology and automotive companies are designing custom high-performance chips for artificial intelligence. Manufacturers are adding sensors, intelligence, and communications into all kinds of commercial and consumer products, creating the Internet of Things. The additional data that's being created drives further demand for advanced processors and memory. And we have many engagements with new companies in China who are strategically committed to participating in future waves of growth. Gary mentioned that we expect WFE spending to be up by over 5% this year, which would give us the highest level of investment seen to date. 2017 investment does not include a wafer size transition as in 2000 or a surge in commodity DRAM investment as in 2007 or an unusually large year of MOCVD spending as in 2011. In fact, I believe our 2017 forecast reflects measured prudent customer spending designed to meet strong demand patterns that we are seeing continue into 2018 and beyond. Our customers will continue to benefit from making big investments in leading-edge capacity to power devices and the cloud. I believe concerns about the cost/benefit of Moore's Law are anchored on the value of yesterday's applications. Consider the value being created by companies who are using technology to transform industries like advertising, retailing, transportation, television, and travel. Today, they are making massive investments in new applications that depend on further innovations in processors, memories, and displays, and a lot more capacity. I see a very healthy future in this for Applied Materials. At Applied, we changed the investment model to deliver higher returns. We aggressively shifted dollars from G&A to R&D and from sustaining R&D to impactful new product R&D. We significantly increased the percentage of winning products, and we accelerated our new product development timelines. These trends have multiplicative effects and are continuing. As a result, we are outperforming our markets and benefiting from delivering more valuable products and services to our customers. Let's start with revenue growth. As Gary said, we expect WFE spending to grow by around 5% or more in calendar 2017. In fiscal 2017, we anticipate that our Services group will grow at twice that rate. Our Semiconductor Systems business will grow at four times that rate, and our Display business will grow at 10 times that rate. As a result, we are gaining share in our markets. The best indication of the value that we provide is profit margins. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 45.4% in Q1, the second highest since 2008. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 26%, a 9-year high. And next quarter, we plan to be higher in both. Our revenue growth and margin expansion are resulting in strong free cash flow, which grew by more than 300% in Q1 from the same period last year. And we are committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. In addition, we're closely monitoring the policy environment. As a U.S.-based manufacturer with strong exports and a global manufacturing network, we have a great deal of flexibility in adapting to the new policies being considered. Next, I'll comment on our performance during Q1 as compared to the same period last year. Orders of $4.2 billion were our highest ever and broad-based. We had a 16-year high in semiconductor systems orders, record orders in services, and very strong display orders of $632 million. In Q1, we grew company revenue by 45% and increased non-GAAP gross margin by 300 basis points. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew by 14% to the high end of the guidance range. Our ongoing spending discipline helped us to more than double our non-GAAP operating profit. We've reduced the non-GAAP tax rate by 6.2 points, and we grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 158%. Next, I'll compare our segment performance during Q1 to the same period last year. We grew Semiconductor Systems revenue by 57% and non-GAAP operating margin by 11.5 points. We grew Services revenue by 12% and non-GAAP operating profit by 1.9 points. We also grew display revenue by 66% and non-GAAP operating profit by 8.4 points. On the balance sheet, we grew cash and investments by 23% to $5.1 billion, and about 36% remained onshore. We paid cash dividends of $108 million and used $130 million for stock buybacks, reducing the ending share count by 5% year over year to 1.08 billion. Now I'll provide our guidance for the second quarter. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.6 billion. The midpoint would be up by 44% year over year. On a year-over-year basis, our Semiconductor Systems revenue should increase by about 51%. Services revenues should increase by about 9%, and display revenue should increase by about 122%. In addition, non-GAAP gross margin should be about 45.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $645 million plus or minus $10 million. And non-GAAP EPS should be in the range of $0.72 to $0.80, the midpoint of which would be up by 124% year over year. In summary, we are raising the ceiling on our expectations for the industries we serve, and we believe our markets will remain strong. We've fundamentally changed our investment model to deliver greater value to our customers, and we are seeing that value reflected in higher market share and profitability. This stronger performance is sustainable, resulting in greater free cash flow. Now, Mike, let's start the Q&A. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please poll the operator and we'll do our best to answer it later in the call. Operator, let's please begin. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Yes, sir. Our first question is from Farhan Ahmad of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thanks for taking my question. My first question is in regards to the linearity of the year. Some of your peers have indicated a significant decline in the second half of the year, primarily driven by 3D NAND, and I just wanted to understand. Is that something you are seeing as well? Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. Sure, Farhan. So let me give you some context for how we think about the year and longer term. We are really driving, Farhan, frankly achieving sustainable year-over-year growth in revenue and share of profit. That's how we think about the business and look at it. As for 2017, this will be another good year. We see WFE up 5% or more in the year. And then for our fiscal year, as I said in the call, our semiconductor revenue should grow at 4x that rate. Our services revenue should grow at 2x that rate, and our display revenue would grow at over 10x that rate. So if you look at it, we gave you actuals for Q1 and guide for Q2. Our full year should model just as I said just now. So with that, I think you get a pretty good feel for the second half of the year for us. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Thanks, Farhan. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from C.J. Muse out of Evercore. Your line is open. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a question around display. How should we be thinking about the linearity of spend there first half/second half on a calendar year basis? And then considering I think you said in the prepared remarks you expect to book roughly $2 billion of revenues there here in the calendar year. How should we think about the trajectory of revenues through calendar 2018? And I guess as part of that, I would love to hear your thoughts on new product introductions and when we should think about weaving I guess incremental revenues from there in there as well. Thank you. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. Sure, I'll start, and Gary can jump in. Display continues to go up for us, frankly. In terms of the market context, when we did the Analyst Day back in September in New York, we thought that 2016 would be WFE numbers of around $14.5 billion, as I remember, and we thought the next year would be about a similar number in calendar 2017. And we're thinking now it's about $17.4 billion in 2017, so the market is up about $3 billion from where we thought. In terms of our own performance, I'll do bookings first. We booked over $2 billion in 2016. We weren't sure we could get that same volume in 2017 because some of those 2016 bookings ship through 2017 and 2018. In fact, we now think the bookings are pretty close in 2017 to what they were in 2016. What's particularly interesting for me in that bookings mix for 2017 is, if you go back to history, we used to be about 60% or so of our bookings were mobile, 65% some years, and about – 65% for TVs, 35% mobile. It kind of flipped last year. We thought we'd continue that this year. We're strong in both this year. TV has come back strong. We mentioned the Gen 10.5 fab. We see seven more of those we're tracking. So this year we think we'll book about 55% for TV, 45% mobile, so strong in both frankly. Then if you look at the revenues, which you asked about, this year we think our revenues are going to be pretty strong throughout the year. In terms of the quarterization, it's a little lumpy. Our Q3 might be a little stronger than our Q2, but pretty strong every quarter. Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc. I could add a little bit more also, C.J., on display. So if you put display in perspective, it's a great example of our ability to take materials engineering into an adjacent market. And if you go over a four-year period of time, from 2012 to 2016, our orders have increased from around $400 million to $2 billion, so – over $2 billion, about a 5x increase in four years in display, which is incredible. But again, it shows the ability to take our materials innovation technologies, CVD, PVD, thin film encapsulation, into a new market. And we've talked about – Bob talked about the TV sizes increasing and the seven Gen 10.5 projects. OLED, mobile is also expanding to new customers. 50% of our demand going forward for this year is new customers for the mobile OLED. And then we've been focused on inflections and increasing our total available market. We've talked about tripling our served market as we go forward. And certainly as these new technologies like OLED or flexible OLED are adopted, that increases our total available market. We've been driving new technologies like thin film encapsulation and e-beam review, again, reusing technologies that we have within our semiconductor business in display. You ask about the new products that we've talked about, and what we've said is that we'll announce those sometime during 2017. But what I would say – and we're not going to do that today, but what I would say is that those projects are on track and tremendous customer pull and investment for those new opportunities. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Thanks, C.J. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC Thank you. So I just wanted to try to ask the question again, Bob, just on the learnings for the year. So if you look at your run rate based upon what you just booked, and if I assume roughly 25% WFE share, which is in your model, you're run-rating at roughly $44 billion – not you, but the industry. And if the year is going to be $37 billion, the math would say that you have to get to $30 billion sometime during the back half of the year. Now maybe things don't fall off that much. But I'm just wondering if you can take those numbers and tell us if you think shipments are going to fall off during the back half of the year because the math seems to say that either shipments are going to fall off quite a bit or WFE is going to be a lot better than $37 billion this year. Thanks. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. Sure, yes. So, Tim, I gave you some color on the first half/second half for us a little bit. I'll give you a little more specific to your question. I don't know that the industry is running at quite $44 billion now. And our model was to get 25.5% market share in 2019. We think we're well on track to that. I'm not sure we're at that point right now, so in terms of the mathematics, it's a little bit different. Further, what I'll say to you is that the stuff I said to you earlier would imply the first half is strong. I don't disagree with that. But what I will also tell you is that we have seen the Q3 and Q4 numbers for us firm up as we go month by month the last few months. So my take on it, 2017 is a strong year. It's going to be a particularly strong year for Applied as we gain more share and display does well for us. We also think that 2018, 2019 we see growth drivers that are really good for us and the industry the next couple years. Will the second half be as strong as the first half? I'm not sure it is, but the overall trends are positive. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Thanks, Tim. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Atif Malik of Citi. Your line is open. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and guide. Gary, some investors are still skeptical on China spending coming in 2018. Can you just provide a bit more color or details on how your engagements are going with Chinese domestic projects? Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc. Sure, let me give you some color on China. So what we're looking at in 2017 for China for Applied Materials is up versus 2016, maybe something like 10% up overall for us. And if you look at 2017 versus 2015, it's up maybe an additional $1 billion overall. Semi is slightly lower in that mix. Display is higher and service is higher. If you look at 2015 versus 2017, we've had 2x growth or anticipating 2x growth in semi revenue and about 50% growth in service and display. And China is really one of our strongest regions both with the multinational companies and the domestic companies there. And as we spend a lot of time and we have very deep relationships with the companies that are there, basically what we hear is that there is a big strategic drive in investment in China. There's a big gap in terms of domestic supply versus demand, and then there's also a drive to build a secure supply chain. So I think all of us see announcements and very large investments over the next several years in China. In talking to those customers, they I believe understand that this is a long-term strategy. They have Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3. And in the beginning, those investments aren't going to be as efficient, especially in the more advanced technologies. But what I would say is that very consistently we see strong drive from a strategic perspective for increased investment in China, and really what we're seeing is 2018 and beyond a significant increase. Again, we increased semi revenue 2x from 2015 to 2017. If you ask me, what do I think 2017 to 2019, that's going to be up a significant amount in semiconductor opportunity. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Great. Thanks, Atif. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Chin of UBS. Your line is open. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC Thanks. Hi, Gary and Bob, nice quarter and guidance too. I have a follow-up question on the display order guidance. Can you share, Gary, how much of the display orders this year, the $2 billion likely come from the Chinese display customers? Because I know we're all waiting for domestic China's semiconductor spend to happen. But can sales to China's display customers bridge us over until the domestic spend of CapEx happens in China next year? Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. I'll start. We're pulling up some slides to help us. So total bookings this year will be over $2 billion in display. We see a lot of the big orders out of China for TVs in particular and some for mobile. So this is the wrong slide. So the numbers are large numbers for China this year. I'd say the majority of the display stuff is probably China. China revenue, okay, so the majority of the $2 billion, my guess – I'm looking for the slide, frankly, is probably of the display bookings, probably half or more is China. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, thanks for taking my question. I also had a display question. So, Bob, if you look at last year, you did about $2 billion in bookings and about $1 billion in revenue. Should we expect that gap to close as you roll forward with new products and OLED gets more traction, or do you think the book to revenue is going to still have a lag effect here? And along the same path, what percentage of your bookings or revenue last year was OLED versus traditional displays? Thank you. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. So your question is the book-to-bill, what's it going to stay for display, and then how much was OLED? I guess that's the question. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch That's right, yes. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. So last year we booked over $2 billion. And we billed – now remember, we moved the web business in there and the service upgrade business, and we billed about 55% of that. This year we're going to book over $2 billion, but we'll bill a higher percentage of that. It's still going to be north of one. In terms of the outlook beyond 2017 – 2018, we're continuing strong book-to-bill – continuing strong bookings, but the book-to-bill narrows. Last year it was 1.6 or 1.7 or something like that. It was a big number, so that's going to trend down over time. But it will stay positive for a while. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Thanks, Krish. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. OLED was – if you look at last year, OLED booking – mobile bookings were 65% of the total. And of the mobile piece, which was 65%, the majority of that was OLED. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great, thanks. Operator Our next question is from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on the solid execution. I think in the prior question you answered, you talked about 50% roughly of your bookings for flat-panel being China-focused. I'm assuming most of this is large screen. But if we look at the Tier 2 OLED players in China, these guys are trying to play catch-up to the leaders in the market. Our research indicates that China is probably going to account for about 30% of the OLED CapEx spend in 2018, which is up significantly from this year's mix levels. So I'm just wondering if you guys are starting to see this trend and just wondering if this is already starting to show up in the order books or the backlog. Or is that still on the come? Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. Yes, it's true. So you've got a couple questions there. You've got the China question and the OLED proliferation question. So if you look at China, as I said earlier, we sell for TV and mobile. TV is pretty big in China this year. But drilling into your question more around OLED and mobile, as we said on the call last time, I think we repeated it this time, we had orders from 10 different OLED manufacturers in the last year, predominantly in the last couple of quarters. Nine of those are for mobile phones, one was a lighting guy. So if you look at the mobile guys, it's proliferating such that beyond the number one leader in OLED, we think that in 2017 our orders for OLED mobile is going to be probably over half from the followers, not just in China though. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great, thank you. It looked like you made nice progress on the operating margin on the display side. Can you talk about where that can go? And can you remind us where that business stands on gross and operating margins versus the semi business? Thank you. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. Sure. We did make nice progress on the display business. So if you go look at it, we're up significantly this year on the operating margins for display in the quarter in particular. We think the year is going to be up a fair amount year on year. We're well on track to hit the margins in the model in display FY 2019. Not every quarter is going to be exactly the same in display. My guess is Q2 may not be quite as high as Q1, but the year is going to be up significantly from last year. Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great, thank you. Operator Our next question is from Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is open. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc. Yes, thank you and congratulations. At the analyst meeting in September, you talked about earnings of $2.80 on I think it was like a $35 billion WFE. This quarter it looks like you're run-rating closer to $3 two years earlier than what we anticipated. So if WFE is coming in at $37 billion this year and you guys think it will hold up again next year, Bob, what's maybe a more reasonable range to think about earnings in fiscal 2019 because the $2.80 does look increasingly conservative? Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. There are a few things. I think we'll do very well against that model. That model had a few assumptions. It assumed a $34.5 billion WFE, and right now we're running a little north of that, frankly. There was a $37 billion model we showed that same day which was $3.17. And the second thing was the market environment in that model was we assumed that the display equipment spending was going to be north of the historical number of $8 billion but not necessarily up to what we realized last year, $14.5 billion. So I would say in market environment, condition number one in those models, I'm more optimistic that the environment in 2019 is north of the $34.5 billion, and I'm more optimistic that the market environment for display spending is north of what we have in our model. So the market is positively biased towards our base model last year, which was at $2.80. The second thing is the share position we had in both semi and display, and we said we'd do 25.5 points in semi and we thought we'd be in a strong position in display. We are very confident of that. We gained 2 points in 2016, up to about 22%, so we've got to get about a point a year the next three years. We'll hit those numbers I think, probably some upside. And then in display, the market, our products look good against the revenue in that plan. So I'd say that the function of share and market result in a revenue opportunity against that model. I think what pleases me as much as anything, frankly, in the results we announced today and for next quarter is the margin profile. We had in the past iteration of the model, we didn't move much on the margins. We said that the base model would be at 44.6% gross margins, and some people were a little skeptical because we hadn't moved too much. We reported today, what was it, 45.2% I guess it was 45.4% actuals, 45.4%. And then what we said about gross margins last quarter was that in fiscal 2017 we'd be up to about 44% in the year. That was a gain of 0.8 point. We now think in fiscal 2017 alone, instead of 0.8-point gain versus 2016, we're going to gain 1.5 points. So if you look at that on the model you asked about, we're probably very comfortable that we can hit the 44.6% gross margin, which is at the $34.5 billion. And the 45.1%, which is at $37 billion, we're probably pretty comfortable. And then we maintain pretty damn tight control on the operating expenses too. So if you back-calculate the guide we give for next quarter, now next quarter is a good quarter, its operating margin is north of 27%. So in the annual models we showed for 2019, we showed operating margins of about 25.1% the $34.5 billion and 26.4% in the $37 billion environment. So at the operating margin we're making progress. And then if you finally go down to the URs, we simply shrink the share count to 1.044 billion. We're confident we'll hit that. So we're not going to redo the model today. But around the market environment relative to that model, around our share position relative to the model, around our execution on gross margins, OpEx, and share count, we're pretty confident that we'll hit or potentially beat that model. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Romit. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Ho of Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter and the projected outlook for 2017. Gary, maybe just looking at 3D NAND and the market opportunity still going forward, you guys obviously have made great inroads in terms of etch and deposition, capital intensity, but also your own share gains. As you look at the industry moving to 64 layers and then eventually to 96 layers, one, how do you see the capital intensity trends for the market overall? And maybe secondly for Applied, how do you see your competitive position increasing as the industry progresses? Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc. So let me take on our position, and Bob can talk about maybe capital intensity. So as we talked about overall, we gained 2 points of share in 2016, and actually our strongest gains are in 3D NAND. And one of the really big drivers for our company is that 3D NAND is materials-enabled scaling versus litho-enabled scaling. I met three of the top four memory CEOs in the last month. All of them are very bullish. The pull that they have for 3D NAND is really tremendous. And if you look in servers, for instance, and the total cost of ownership and the power consumption, I was in our data center, it's 80% less power consumption, and total cost of ownership is significantly better. So all of the people I'm talking to are very bullish about 3D NAND. Our position in 3D NAND, as we've talked about, we increase our TAM, our total available market by a factor of three. And when we're talking also about operating margins and our opportunities in display or in semi, our strategy is to focus on inflections. So we're winning share in inflections and we're also delivering new capabilities. And so that comes through in 40% of our revenue being introduced from products that were introduced in the last three years. Just in 2016, our etch revenue was up 30%, CVD 33%, CMP revenue up 33%. Our e-beam products, another area where there's a big inflection, the largest part of our PDC business, up 33%. So we see tremendous pull. And as you go to these future generations of 3D NAND, it's really all about materials innovation, how you scale to those additional numbers of layers, and we're in a really great position. The pull that we have from our customers is earlier, deeper, and broader than we've ever seen in the past. And Bob can talk maybe about the capital intensity. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. On 3D NAND? Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc. Yeah. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. So what was your comparison, again, Patrick, which to which, which layer to which layer? I'll see if I can fill in. So the capital intensity for 3D NAND if you go from planar to, say, 50 layers, the total CapEx is about $3.5 billion on planar, and 48 layers it's about $5 billion for greenfield. Now I think the thing that's interesting is if we go from a planar reuse to a 50-layer or 48-layer, the total CapEx to upgrade is $2.6 billion, $3.2 billion, almost the same as the opportunity in planar at $3.5 billion. Now what's really interesting for a company like us, materials is very etch and deposition-intensive. Now what's particularly interesting for Applied Materials additionally to that, to be frank, one, we didn't have the products or incumbent positions at the planar position, so the level of reuse for Applied is very low. And you can see in our share gains, which have really been driven in etch, CVD, and some in CMP, is around the share gains we have made within etch, CVD, and CMP around some of these conversions from planar to 3D NAND, and also some on DRAM. So one, total spend is bigger. Two, it's really etch and deposition-intensive. And three, it's been really good for Applied Materials within those products in the transition. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Thanks, Patrick. Operator Thank you. Our next question from Edwin Mok of Needham. Your line is open. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Operator, we're not hearing Edwin. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC Sorry about that. So I want to ask you guys about foundry logic. Just from your last report to this report, have you seen more broadening of demand in 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer or in the tray mesh? It sounds like you guys got a little more in China. (47:15) And then on IMIS (47:20), specifically on 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer, in terms of optioning or growth in 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer, is it more just complex transistors that allows you to (47:27) demand more of your product because you have such strong around transistor technology, or is it that you expect share gain around patterning at 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer that allows you to grow in that as those nodes go into production? Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. I'll do the first one, and Gary will do more the second one. So on broadening, this has been a year that's interesting in foundry. What might surprise you that of the trailing edge, and I'll define trailing-edge as 20-nanometer, 28-nanometer and above, 45-nanometer. It's 40% in 2017 will be that's those nodes, and you've got 55% we think for 7-nanometer and 10-namometer, and about 5% 14-nanometer, 16-nanometer. So what's the point? 40% of spend this year in the foundries is 20-nanometer and above, so it's really strong. Last year it was about 38%. So in a bigger spend year it's actually a bigger percentage, which is interesting. Now, so what you have this year is spending by the biggest foundry leader pretty strong and pretty big spending at the trailing nodes. And the opportunity you have to sustain foundry spending, which people are questioning about next year, is that we think that in 2018 we're going to have continued spending at the trailing edge. We think secondly, we're going to have a broadening of foundry spending, particularly next year. You asked about broadening of spending. I think it's a bigger impact next year because if you look at the shells they're putting up and the opportunities in SMIC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES in China and places like that, you're going to see some broadening of that. In terms of the leading edge on 10-nanometer/7-nanometer, by the end of this year you're going to have 120,000 to 140,000 wafer starts of capacity for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. We think that could probably at its peak double. So there's still some chance to broaden out 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer next year. So next year we're not pessimistic on foundry. We think there's obviously: A), the trailing edge is strong, number one. Number two, we see some still significant additions for 10-nanometer/7-nanometer, whether it's conversions or greenfield. And three, we see broadening among some of the customer base. Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc. So on the share gains, we have, as Bob talked about, I think pretty good line of sight on 7-nanometer and very strong pull for our transistor and interconnect products where we have extremely high share, and we're seeing more steps and an increase in our total available market as you go to 7-nanometer. In addition to the three memory CEOs I met, I also met the head of R&D for our largest logic and foundry customers within the last month. And what I would say is that we have stronger pull for earlier, deeper, and broader collaborations than we've ever had in the history of Applied Materials. And one of the things that we're really focused on, if you go past 7-nanometers, how do we enable our customers to build devices that they could never build before. So certainly we have great pull for new products like Selectra, which again gives designers a capability that they never had before in designing new types of devices. And you will definitely see and we're seeing the ability to grow as fast as we can qualify with this kind of new capability. We have new films that our customers are adopting for 5-nanometer and beyond that also enable them to design devices in different ways. And certainly the transistor, interconnect patterning is another area we've talked about where we have tremendous pull with Sym3 across the board for logic and foundry customers. The Selectra, Olympia, Precision CVD, PROVision, the LK Prime for CMP, we're in the early innings of adoption of many of those products. And as you go beyond 7-nanometer, the opportunities for us even become much larger for these products and other products that we have in our pipeline. So for me, those conversations with those people running R&D are incredibly exciting, and the pull is really tremendous for Applied. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Great. Thanks, Edwin. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Weston Twigg of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into I guess China and NAND a little bit more directly. A company a couple weeks ago, small cap, said that they thought their revenue from NAND memory customers would increase in the second half, partly driven by domestic Chinese memory producers, so some of these new fab projects that have been in the works. I'm just wondering if you're actually seeing any of that kind of demand that you would actually commit to maybe delivering some equipment in the second half, or if you still think those domestic projects might be more of a 2018 event. Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc. We definitely see – we're engaged with all of those different companies. Our share in China is the highest or near the highest that we have for any region, so our engagement with those companies are very strong. We don't really see in 2017 significant revenue growth coming from those companies. Again, our overall revenue in China we anticipate in 2017 is somewhere around $2.6 billion. So for us having something that moves the needle for us has to be fairly sizeable. We are definitely deeply engaged with all of those companies and we look at 2018 and beyond as a much bigger opportunity. Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities Thanks, Wes. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. All right, thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question from Craig Ellis of B. Riley. Your line is open. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the good execution. I wanted to return to the comments regarding reduced industry volatility because some of the majors we have for upstream semiconductor industry volatility show about a 75% reduction over the last five years versus the preceding 15 years. So it seems like for a company like Applied Materials, in that environment there should be certain parts of the business that benefit from increased operating efficiency. So the first part of the question would be are you seeing that and to what extent is that realized? And the second part of the question is there should also be in that environment increased free cash flow predictability. And how does the company think about in a more stable environment, more seasonal environment, increasing systematic cash return or cash actions to create value? Thank you. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. So there are probably about three levels to that question: one, the volatility question; two was the benefits to the operating margins from volatility; and three, the benefits to cash returns. So in terms of volatility, I completely agree with you. The volatility is trending down. Almost every metric we look at indicates that. The long-term metrics or the demand drivers for the industry are much more diverse and sustainable, and then layer on that you've got all these technology conversions. But I was just looking at some data today that the volatility is down, but within Applied it's down too because we are a much broader company. So I'll give you a couple of data points that I hadn't shared before. So if you just look at our revenue split in semi in 2015, 2016, and 2017, our percent with memory has stayed pretty steady at 48%, 47%, 47%. And then our percent that's been foundry has ranged from 38% to 42%, and logic is 12% or 13%. So within device type, we're much stronger than we used to be. And we project in 2017 that our market share by device type, in NAND, DRAM, foundry, and logic, in all four of the major categories will be 21.5% or above, whereas we used to have a 10 to 15-point spread between some of our low memory ones and our high foundry. We've gotten a lot stronger in memory. So the volatility in the industry is down and the volatility within Applied is down a lot. And then you layer in the strength in the service business, which has grown a lot, and the display business, which has grown a lot, and it's sustainable. So I agree with you on the volatility. Where will we see the benefits in the operating margin? We're going to see them in a few places. One, we will grow our revenue line and it will be more predictable, so that results in a few things. One, you tend to use factory utilization higher, so cost of goods sold, gross margins tend to trend up. So if you look at the benefits on gross margins, we are just grinding away on material costs and factory utilization, and that's helping us on these gross margins. As I said earlier in the call, we thought our gross margins would be up this year by 0.8 point to 44 points. We now think we're going to be up 1.5 points. And a lot of this is efficiency, grinding away, sustainability more predictable, less volatility, we talked about. And then I said earlier on the call that we predict our operating margins in Q2 to be north of 27%. So we are seeing it in the numbers. The company is becoming more efficient, more effective with the products we're doing, but also with this less volatility is contributing. We are now, for instance, in our factories looking at being much more aggressive in what we ship in the first four weeks of a quarter to even more level-load our factories. So you're 100% right. In terms of the benefits to the investors, we are starting to generate more significant cash returns. So if you look at the operating cash flow, it was 20% this quarter, which is very high for us in Q1. Last year Q1 was 9%, so we are doing it. Now the question is getting it back to investors. We are going to do it. We didn't do too much last quarter because of some – we were looking at foundry conditions around what's going to change in the tax laws, movement of cash between overseas and the U.S. But we see – one, we are committed to do it. Two, I think we'll have the flexibility to do it. And three, some of the changes that are being proposed in Washington may be beneficial to us in multiple ways, long-term tax going to a territorial system, we're on a worldwide system. So I think it's a great opportunity for the investors of Applied on this. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Great. Thanks, Craig, for the question. And, operator, I think we have time for just one more please. Operator Yes, sir. Our last question is from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Great, thanks for taking my question. Your DRAM orders have bounced back to where it was a year ago. Obviously, you're gaining share there as well. But can you talk about what you expect bit growth-wise that that could translate into for DRAM? And do you share the view that DRAM suppliers are remaining disciplined in capital spending during the period where pricing is pretty good? Any color would be helpful. Thanks. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. I can start and Gary can jump in. I'll tell you what's encouraging for me in some of this stuff. If you look at NAND and DRAM – look at NAND, I'll look at DRAM in a second. We look at NAND bit growth in supply is pretty much in line and growing about 45% a year, and that's 45% over a bigger and bigger install base. So the end-use demand for NAND is pretty damn strong. And DRAM is pretty similar. We see bit demand in 2016 up about 30%, and then we see server DRAM up about 40% to 45% in 2017. And supply has been a little tighter. We see 2017 supply bit growth is only about 25% to 30%, and then we see a lot of smartphone consumption up for new Android 6GB and Apple third-generation. But what's good for Applied is our market share within DRAM is up about 5 points from 2012 to 2015, and we think we're going to get another point in 2016. So we think, one, the marketing demand for DRAM and NAND is growing pretty healthily. Two, it's growing pretty disciplined, more frankly. Even with NAND capacity additions, what we see is big demand drivers for more NAND. For instance, another factoid I don't think we gave you is that as solid-state drives become more and more cost-effective, there's probably going to be a need for up to about 500,000 more wafer starts greenfield to add capacity to what they have today. In other words, if you look in the world, there used to be about 1.4 million wafer starts for NAND. Now it might be 1.6 million wafer starts. But that's not even enough. Over the next four years, they probably have to add another 500,000 just for servers. Each 100,000 of NAND is worth about $5 billion. That's about $5 billion that they have to add to reach their growth in their markets. So what's the point? Good growth drivers for NAND and DRAM, number one. Number two, pretty disciplined even with the capacity to do it on NAND because their market is expanding. Three, our position has gone up where we've gained by the time we're done in 2016 we'll probably have gained about seven points in both NAND and DRAM from 2012. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Okay, great. So thanks for that question. And then, Bob, if you'd like to, summarize it all before we close the call. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. We talk about a lot of esoteric stuff here, bit growth and materials engineering. When I step back, even more than a few years ago, I think Applied has a really good business. If you look at the markets in which we compete are doing really well, better than they were years ago. Our position is much better. And as somebody answered on the call, our better execution and less volatility of the market is resulting in significant improvement in operating margin to cash flow. So we have a really good business. And what we're doing here is driving sustainable year-over-year growth in revenue, share, and profitabilities. So the three things, as I would summarize again, is one, our markets are getting better, bigger, and less volatile. WFE and display are both strong with positive long-term outlook. We have strong share, as I said, in all device types. We were up in memory in particular. In foundry, we've always been strong. And then display is doing very well. And if you look at our service business, which was $2 billion back in 2013, we're going to hit $3.2 billion in 2019, so that's grown a lot, and that's a very strong baseline business. Second, our execution is better. Our deep pipeline of products enabled by the product development engine, where 40% of our equipment revenue now is generated from products we've introduced in the last three years, we have multiple years of share gains. And what I don't think we mentioned on our call, we have record backlog of $5.5 billion at this point. So that's all around better execution. And finally, the question I just got asked, billing, your return on cash is better than ever. Revenue is outpacing our markets. Operating margin is growing. As I said, we're going to be over 27% next year, and we have a great deal of flexibility to return more cash to shareholders. So I just think Applied has got a really good business when you cut through it. I feel really good about the business. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Great, okay. Hey, thanks, Bob. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of our call is going to be available on the website beginning at 5:00 PM Pacific.

Our first question is from Farhan Ahmad of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thanks for taking my question. My first question is in regards to the linearity of the year. Some of your peers have indicated a significant decline in the second half of the year, primarily driven by 3D NAND, and I just wanted to understand. Is that something you are seeing as well? Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. Sure, Farhan. So let me give you some context for how we think about the year and longer term. We are really driving, Farhan, frankly achieving sustainable year-over-year growth in revenue and share of profit. That's how we think about the business and look at it. As for 2017, this will be another good year. We see WFE up 5% or more in the year. And then for our fiscal year, as I said in the call, our semiconductor revenue should grow at 4x that rate. Our services revenue should grow at 2x that rate, and our display revenue would grow at over 10x that rate. So if you look at it, we gave you actuals for Q1 and guide for Q2. Our full year should model just as I said just now. So with that, I think you get a pretty good feel for the second half of the year for us. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Thanks, Farhan. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from C.J. Muse out of Evercore. Your line is open. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a question around display. How should we be thinking about the linearity of spend there first half/second half on a calendar year basis? And then considering I think you said in the prepared remarks you expect to book roughly $2 billion of revenues there here in the calendar year. How should we think about the trajectory of revenues through calendar 2018? And I guess as part of that, I would love to hear your thoughts on new product introductions and when we should think about weaving I guess incremental revenues from there in there as well. Thank you. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. Sure, I'll start, and Gary can jump in. Display continues to go up for us, frankly. In terms of the market context, when we did the Analyst Day back in September in New York, we thought that 2016 would be WFE numbers of around $14.5 billion, as I remember, and we thought the next year would be about a similar number in calendar 2017. And we're thinking now it's about $17.4 billion in 2017, so the market is up about $3 billion from where we thought. In terms of our own performance, I'll do bookings first. We booked over $2 billion in 2016. We weren't sure we could get that same volume in 2017 because some of those 2016 bookings ship through 2017 and 2018. In fact, we now think the bookings are pretty close in 2017 to what they were in 2016. What's particularly interesting for me in that bookings mix for 2017 is, if you go back to history, we used to be about 60% or so of our bookings were mobile, 65% some years, and about – 65% for TVs, 35% mobile. It kind of flipped last year. We thought we'd continue that this year. We're strong in both this year. TV has come back strong. We mentioned the Gen 10.5 fab. We see seven more of those we're tracking. So this year we think we'll book about 55% for TV, 45% mobile, so strong in both frankly. Then if you look at the revenues, which you asked about, this year we think our revenues are going to be pretty strong throughout the year. In terms of the quarterization, it's a little lumpy. Our Q3 might be a little stronger than our Q2, but pretty strong every quarter. Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc. I could add a little bit more also, C.J., on display. So if you put display in perspective, it's a great example of our ability to take materials engineering into an adjacent market. And if you go over a four-year period of time, from 2012 to 2016, our orders have increased from around $400 million to $2 billion, so – over $2 billion, about a 5x increase in four years in display, which is incredible. But again, it shows the ability to take our materials innovation technologies, CVD, PVD, thin film encapsulation, into a new market. And we've talked about – Bob talked about the TV sizes increasing and the seven Gen 10.5 projects. OLED, mobile is also expanding to new customers. 50% of our demand going forward for this year is new customers for the mobile OLED. And then we've been focused on inflections and increasing our total available market. We've talked about tripling our served market as we go forward. And certainly as these new technologies like OLED or flexible OLED are adopted, that increases our total available market. We've been driving new technologies like thin film encapsulation and e-beam review, again, reusing technologies that we have within our semiconductor business in display. You ask about the new products that we've talked about, and what we've said is that we'll announce those sometime during 2017. But what I would say – and we're not going to do that today, but what I would say is that those projects are on track and tremendous customer pull and investment for those new opportunities. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Thanks, C.J. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC Thank you. So I just wanted to try to ask the question again, Bob, just on the learnings for the year. So if you look at your run rate based upon what you just booked, and if I assume roughly 25% WFE share, which is in your model, you're run-rating at roughly $44 billion – not you, but the industry. And if the year is going to be $37 billion, the math would say that you have to get to $30 billion sometime during the back half of the year. Now maybe things don't fall off that much. But I'm just wondering if you can take those numbers and tell us if you think shipments are going to fall off during the back half of the year because the math seems to say that either shipments are going to fall off quite a bit or WFE is going to be a lot better than $37 billion this year. Thanks. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. Sure, yes. So, Tim, I gave you some color on the first half/second half for us a little bit. I'll give you a little more specific to your question. I don't know that the industry is running at quite $44 billion now. And our model was to get 25.5% market share in 2019. We think we're well on track to that. I'm not sure we're at that point right now, so in terms of the mathematics, it's a little bit different. Further, what I'll say to you is that the stuff I said to you earlier would imply the first half is strong. I don't disagree with that. But what I will also tell you is that we have seen the Q3 and Q4 numbers for us firm up as we go month by month the last few months. So my take on it, 2017 is a strong year. It's going to be a particularly strong year for Applied as we gain more share and display does well for us. We also think that 2018, 2019 we see growth drivers that are really good for us and the industry the next couple years. Will the second half be as strong as the first half? I'm not sure it is, but the overall trends are positive. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Thanks, Tim. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Atif Malik of Citi. Your line is open. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and guide. Gary, some investors are still skeptical on China spending coming in 2018. Can you just provide a bit more color or details on how your engagements are going with Chinese domestic projects? Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc. Sure, let me give you some color on China. So what we're looking at in 2017 for China for Applied Materials is up versus 2016, maybe something like 10% up overall for us. And if you look at 2017 versus 2015, it's up maybe an additional $1 billion overall. Semi is slightly lower in that mix. Display is higher and service is higher. If you look at 2015 versus 2017, we've had 2x growth or anticipating 2x growth in semi revenue and about 50% growth in service and display. And China is really one of our strongest regions both with the multinational companies and the domestic companies there. And as we spend a lot of time and we have very deep relationships with the companies that are there, basically what we hear is that there is a big strategic drive in investment in China. There's a big gap in terms of domestic supply versus demand, and then there's also a drive to build a secure supply chain. So I think all of us see announcements and very large investments over the next several years in China. In talking to those customers, they I believe understand that this is a long-term strategy. They have Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3. And in the beginning, those investments aren't going to be as efficient, especially in the more advanced technologies. But what I would say is that very consistently we see strong drive from a strategic perspective for increased investment in China, and really what we're seeing is 2018 and beyond a significant increase. Again, we increased semi revenue 2x from 2015 to 2017. If you ask me, what do I think 2017 to 2019, that's going to be up a significant amount in semiconductor opportunity. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Great. Thanks, Atif. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Chin of UBS. Your line is open. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC Thanks. Hi, Gary and Bob, nice quarter and guidance too. I have a follow-up question on the display order guidance. Can you share, Gary, how much of the display orders this year, the $2 billion likely come from the Chinese display customers? Because I know we're all waiting for domestic China's semiconductor spend to happen. But can sales to China's display customers bridge us over until the domestic spend of CapEx happens in China next year? Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. I'll start. We're pulling up some slides to help us. So total bookings this year will be over $2 billion in display. We see a lot of the big orders out of China for TVs in particular and some for mobile. So this is the wrong slide. So the numbers are large numbers for China this year. I'd say the majority of the display stuff is probably China. China revenue, okay, so the majority of the $2 billion, my guess – I'm looking for the slide, frankly, is probably of the display bookings, probably half or more is China. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, thanks for taking my question. I also had a display question. So, Bob, if you look at last year, you did about $2 billion in bookings and about $1 billion in revenue. Should we expect that gap to close as you roll forward with new products and OLED gets more traction, or do you think the book to revenue is going to still have a lag effect here? And along the same path, what percentage of your bookings or revenue last year was OLED versus traditional displays? Thank you. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. So your question is the book-to-bill, what's it going to stay for display, and then how much was OLED? I guess that's the question. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch That's right, yes. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. So last year we booked over $2 billion. And we billed – now remember, we moved the web business in there and the service upgrade business, and we billed about 55% of that. This year we're going to book over $2 billion, but we'll bill a higher percentage of that. It's still going to be north of one. In terms of the outlook beyond 2017 – 2018, we're continuing strong book-to-bill – continuing strong bookings, but the book-to-bill narrows. Last year it was 1.6 or 1.7 or something like that. It was a big number, so that's going to trend down over time. But it will stay positive for a while. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Thanks, Krish. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. OLED was – if you look at last year, OLED booking – mobile bookings were 65% of the total. And of the mobile piece, which was 65%, the majority of that was OLED. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great, thanks. Operator Our next question is from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on the solid execution. I think in the prior question you answered, you talked about 50% roughly of your bookings for flat-panel being China-focused. I'm assuming most of this is large screen. But if we look at the Tier 2 OLED players in China, these guys are trying to play catch-up to the leaders in the market. Our research indicates that China is probably going to account for about 30% of the OLED CapEx spend in 2018, which is up significantly from this year's mix levels. So I'm just wondering if you guys are starting to see this trend and just wondering if this is already starting to show up in the order books or the backlog. Or is that still on the come? Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. Yes, it's true. So you've got a couple questions there. You've got the China question and the OLED proliferation question. So if you look at China, as I said earlier, we sell for TV and mobile. TV is pretty big in China this year. But drilling into your question more around OLED and mobile, as we said on the call last time, I think we repeated it this time, we had orders from 10 different OLED manufacturers in the last year, predominantly in the last couple of quarters. Nine of those are for mobile phones, one was a lighting guy. So if you look at the mobile guys, it's proliferating such that beyond the number one leader in OLED, we think that in 2017 our orders for OLED mobile is going to be probably over half from the followers, not just in China though. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great, thank you. It looked like you made nice progress on the operating margin on the display side. Can you talk about where that can go? And can you remind us where that business stands on gross and operating margins versus the semi business? Thank you. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. Sure. We did make nice progress on the display business. So if you go look at it, we're up significantly this year on the operating margins for display in the quarter in particular. We think the year is going to be up a fair amount year on year. We're well on track to hit the margins in the model in display FY 2019. Not every quarter is going to be exactly the same in display. My guess is Q2 may not be quite as high as Q1, but the year is going to be up significantly from last year. Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great, thank you. Operator Our next question is from Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is open. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc. Yes, thank you and congratulations. At the analyst meeting in September, you talked about earnings of $2.80 on I think it was like a $35 billion WFE. This quarter it looks like you're run-rating closer to $3 two years earlier than what we anticipated. So if WFE is coming in at $37 billion this year and you guys think it will hold up again next year, Bob, what's maybe a more reasonable range to think about earnings in fiscal 2019 because the $2.80 does look increasingly conservative? Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. There are a few things. I think we'll do very well against that model. That model had a few assumptions. It assumed a $34.5 billion WFE, and right now we're running a little north of that, frankly. There was a $37 billion model we showed that same day which was $3.17. And the second thing was the market environment in that model was we assumed that the display equipment spending was going to be north of the historical number of $8 billion but not necessarily up to what we realized last year, $14.5 billion. So I would say in market environment, condition number one in those models, I'm more optimistic that the environment in 2019 is north of the $34.5 billion, and I'm more optimistic that the market environment for display spending is north of what we have in our model. So the market is positively biased towards our base model last year, which was at $2.80. The second thing is the share position we had in both semi and display, and we said we'd do 25.5 points in semi and we thought we'd be in a strong position in display. We are very confident of that. We gained 2 points in 2016, up to about 22%, so we've got to get about a point a year the next three years. We'll hit those numbers I think, probably some upside. And then in display, the market, our products look good against the revenue in that plan. So I'd say that the function of share and market result in a revenue opportunity against that model. I think what pleases me as much as anything, frankly, in the results we announced today and for next quarter is the margin profile. We had in the past iteration of the model, we didn't move much on the margins. We said that the base model would be at 44.6% gross margins, and some people were a little skeptical because we hadn't moved too much. We reported today, what was it, 45.2% I guess it was 45.4% actuals, 45.4%. And then what we said about gross margins last quarter was that in fiscal 2017 we'd be up to about 44% in the year. That was a gain of 0.8 point. We now think in fiscal 2017 alone, instead of 0.8-point gain versus 2016, we're going to gain 1.5 points. So if you look at that on the model you asked about, we're probably very comfortable that we can hit the 44.6% gross margin, which is at the $34.5 billion. And the 45.1%, which is at $37 billion, we're probably pretty comfortable. And then we maintain pretty damn tight control on the operating expenses too. So if you back-calculate the guide we give for next quarter, now next quarter is a good quarter, its operating margin is north of 27%. So in the annual models we showed for 2019, we showed operating margins of about 25.1% the $34.5 billion and 26.4% in the $37 billion environment. So at the operating margin we're making progress. And then if you finally go down to the URs, we simply shrink the share count to 1.044 billion. We're confident we'll hit that. So we're not going to redo the model today. But around the market environment relative to that model, around our share position relative to the model, around our execution on gross margins, OpEx, and share count, we're pretty confident that we'll hit or potentially beat that model. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Romit. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Ho of Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter and the projected outlook for 2017. Gary, maybe just looking at 3D NAND and the market opportunity still going forward, you guys obviously have made great inroads in terms of etch and deposition, capital intensity, but also your own share gains. As you look at the industry moving to 64 layers and then eventually to 96 layers, one, how do you see the capital intensity trends for the market overall? And maybe secondly for Applied, how do you see your competitive position increasing as the industry progresses? Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc. So let me take on our position, and Bob can talk about maybe capital intensity. So as we talked about overall, we gained 2 points of share in 2016, and actually our strongest gains are in 3D NAND. And one of the really big drivers for our company is that 3D NAND is materials-enabled scaling versus litho-enabled scaling. I met three of the top four memory CEOs in the last month. All of them are very bullish. The pull that they have for 3D NAND is really tremendous. And if you look in servers, for instance, and the total cost of ownership and the power consumption, I was in our data center, it's 80% less power consumption, and total cost of ownership is significantly better. So all of the people I'm talking to are very bullish about 3D NAND. Our position in 3D NAND, as we've talked about, we increase our TAM, our total available market by a factor of three. And when we're talking also about operating margins and our opportunities in display or in semi, our strategy is to focus on inflections. So we're winning share in inflections and we're also delivering new capabilities. And so that comes through in 40% of our revenue being introduced from products that were introduced in the last three years. Just in 2016, our etch revenue was up 30%, CVD 33%, CMP revenue up 33%. Our e-beam products, another area where there's a big inflection, the largest part of our PDC business, up 33%. So we see tremendous pull. And as you go to these future generations of 3D NAND, it's really all about materials innovation, how you scale to those additional numbers of layers, and we're in a really great position. The pull that we have from our customers is earlier, deeper, and broader than we've ever seen in the past. And Bob can talk maybe about the capital intensity. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. On 3D NAND? Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc. Yeah. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. So what was your comparison, again, Patrick, which to which, which layer to which layer? I'll see if I can fill in. So the capital intensity for 3D NAND if you go from planar to, say, 50 layers, the total CapEx is about $3.5 billion on planar, and 48 layers it's about $5 billion for greenfield. Now I think the thing that's interesting is if we go from a planar reuse to a 50-layer or 48-layer, the total CapEx to upgrade is $2.6 billion, $3.2 billion, almost the same as the opportunity in planar at $3.5 billion. Now what's really interesting for a company like us, materials is very etch and deposition-intensive. Now what's particularly interesting for Applied Materials additionally to that, to be frank, one, we didn't have the products or incumbent positions at the planar position, so the level of reuse for Applied is very low. And you can see in our share gains, which have really been driven in etch, CVD, and some in CMP, is around the share gains we have made within etch, CVD, and CMP around some of these conversions from planar to 3D NAND, and also some on DRAM. So one, total spend is bigger. Two, it's really etch and deposition-intensive. And three, it's been really good for Applied Materials within those products in the transition. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Thanks, Patrick. Operator Thank you. Our next question from Edwin Mok of Needham. Your line is open. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Operator, we're not hearing Edwin. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC Sorry about that. So I want to ask you guys about foundry logic. Just from your last report to this report, have you seen more broadening of demand in 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer or in the tray mesh? It sounds like you guys got a little more in China. (47:15) And then on IMIS (47:20), specifically on 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer, in terms of optioning or growth in 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer, is it more just complex transistors that allows you to (47:27) demand more of your product because you have such strong around transistor technology, or is it that you expect share gain around patterning at 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer that allows you to grow in that as those nodes go into production? Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. I'll do the first one, and Gary will do more the second one. So on broadening, this has been a year that's interesting in foundry. What might surprise you that of the trailing edge, and I'll define trailing-edge as 20-nanometer, 28-nanometer and above, 45-nanometer. It's 40% in 2017 will be that's those nodes, and you've got 55% we think for 7-nanometer and 10-namometer, and about 5% 14-nanometer, 16-nanometer. So what's the point? 40% of spend this year in the foundries is 20-nanometer and above, so it's really strong. Last year it was about 38%. So in a bigger spend year it's actually a bigger percentage, which is interesting. Now, so what you have this year is spending by the biggest foundry leader pretty strong and pretty big spending at the trailing nodes. And the opportunity you have to sustain foundry spending, which people are questioning about next year, is that we think that in 2018 we're going to have continued spending at the trailing edge. We think secondly, we're going to have a broadening of foundry spending, particularly next year. You asked about broadening of spending. I think it's a bigger impact next year because if you look at the shells they're putting up and the opportunities in SMIC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES in China and places like that, you're going to see some broadening of that. In terms of the leading edge on 10-nanometer/7-nanometer, by the end of this year you're going to have 120,000 to 140,000 wafer starts of capacity for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. We think that could probably at its peak double. So there's still some chance to broaden out 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer next year. So next year we're not pessimistic on foundry. We think there's obviously: A), the trailing edge is strong, number one. Number two, we see some still significant additions for 10-nanometer/7-nanometer, whether it's conversions or greenfield. And three, we see broadening among some of the customer base. Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc. So on the share gains, we have, as Bob talked about, I think pretty good line of sight on 7-nanometer and very strong pull for our transistor and interconnect products where we have extremely high share, and we're seeing more steps and an increase in our total available market as you go to 7-nanometer. In addition to the three memory CEOs I met, I also met the head of R&D for our largest logic and foundry customers within the last month. And what I would say is that we have stronger pull for earlier, deeper, and broader collaborations than we've ever had in the history of Applied Materials. And one of the things that we're really focused on, if you go past 7-nanometers, how do we enable our customers to build devices that they could never build before. So certainly we have great pull for new products like Selectra, which again gives designers a capability that they never had before in designing new types of devices. And you will definitely see and we're seeing the ability to grow as fast as we can qualify with this kind of new capability. We have new films that our customers are adopting for 5-nanometer and beyond that also enable them to design devices in different ways. And certainly the transistor, interconnect patterning is another area we've talked about where we have tremendous pull with Sym3 across the board for logic and foundry customers. The Selectra, Olympia, Precision CVD, PROVision, the LK Prime for CMP, we're in the early innings of adoption of many of those products. And as you go beyond 7-nanometer, the opportunities for us even become much larger for these products and other products that we have in our pipeline. So for me, those conversations with those people running R&D are incredibly exciting, and the pull is really tremendous for Applied. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Great. Thanks, Edwin. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Weston Twigg of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into I guess China and NAND a little bit more directly. A company a couple weeks ago, small cap, said that they thought their revenue from NAND memory customers would increase in the second half, partly driven by domestic Chinese memory producers, so some of these new fab projects that have been in the works. I'm just wondering if you're actually seeing any of that kind of demand that you would actually commit to maybe delivering some equipment in the second half, or if you still think those domestic projects might be more of a 2018 event. Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc. We definitely see – we're engaged with all of those different companies. Our share in China is the highest or near the highest that we have for any region, so our engagement with those companies are very strong. We don't really see in 2017 significant revenue growth coming from those companies. Again, our overall revenue in China we anticipate in 2017 is somewhere around $2.6 billion. So for us having something that moves the needle for us has to be fairly sizeable. We are definitely deeply engaged with all of those companies and we look at 2018 and beyond as a much bigger opportunity. Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities Thanks, Wes. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. All right, thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question from Craig Ellis of B. Riley. Your line is open. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the good execution. I wanted to return to the comments regarding reduced industry volatility because some of the majors we have for upstream semiconductor industry volatility show about a 75% reduction over the last five years versus the preceding 15 years. So it seems like for a company like Applied Materials, in that environment there should be certain parts of the business that benefit from increased operating efficiency. So the first part of the question would be are you seeing that and to what extent is that realized? And the second part of the question is there should also be in that environment increased free cash flow predictability. And how does the company think about in a more stable environment, more seasonal environment, increasing systematic cash return or cash actions to create value? Thank you. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. So there are probably about three levels to that question: one, the volatility question; two was the benefits to the operating margins from volatility; and three, the benefits to cash returns. So in terms of volatility, I completely agree with you. The volatility is trending down. Almost every metric we look at indicates that. The long-term metrics or the demand drivers for the industry are much more diverse and sustainable, and then layer on that you've got all these technology conversions. But I was just looking at some data today that the volatility is down, but within Applied it's down too because we are a much broader company. So I'll give you a couple of data points that I hadn't shared before. So if you just look at our revenue split in semi in 2015, 2016, and 2017, our percent with memory has stayed pretty steady at 48%, 47%, 47%. And then our percent that's been foundry has ranged from 38% to 42%, and logic is 12% or 13%. So within device type, we're much stronger than we used to be. And we project in 2017 that our market share by device type, in NAND, DRAM, foundry, and logic, in all four of the major categories will be 21.5% or above, whereas we used to have a 10 to 15-point spread between some of our low memory ones and our high foundry. We've gotten a lot stronger in memory. So the volatility in the industry is down and the volatility within Applied is down a lot. And then you layer in the strength in the service business, which has grown a lot, and the display business, which has grown a lot, and it's sustainable. So I agree with you on the volatility. Where will we see the benefits in the operating margin? We're going to see them in a few places. One, we will grow our revenue line and it will be more predictable, so that results in a few things. One, you tend to use factory utilization higher, so cost of goods sold, gross margins tend to trend up. So if you look at the benefits on gross margins, we are just grinding away on material costs and factory utilization, and that's helping us on these gross margins. As I said earlier in the call, we thought our gross margins would be up this year by 0.8 point to 44 points. We now think we're going to be up 1.5 points. And a lot of this is efficiency, grinding away, sustainability more predictable, less volatility, we talked about. And then I said earlier on the call that we predict our operating margins in Q2 to be north of 27%. So we are seeing it in the numbers. The company is becoming more efficient, more effective with the products we're doing, but also with this less volatility is contributing. We are now, for instance, in our factories looking at being much more aggressive in what we ship in the first four weeks of a quarter to even more level-load our factories. So you're 100% right. In terms of the benefits to the investors, we are starting to generate more significant cash returns. So if you look at the operating cash flow, it was 20% this quarter, which is very high for us in Q1. Last year Q1 was 9%, so we are doing it. Now the question is getting it back to investors. We are going to do it. We didn't do too much last quarter because of some – we were looking at foundry conditions around what's going to change in the tax laws, movement of cash between overseas and the U.S. But we see – one, we are committed to do it. Two, I think we'll have the flexibility to do it. And three, some of the changes that are being proposed in Washington may be beneficial to us in multiple ways, long-term tax going to a territorial system, we're on a worldwide system. So I think it's a great opportunity for the investors of Applied on this. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Great. Thanks, Craig, for the question. And, operator, I think we have time for just one more please. Operator Yes, sir. Our last question is from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Great, thanks for taking my question. Your DRAM orders have bounced back to where it was a year ago. Obviously, you're gaining share there as well. But can you talk about what you expect bit growth-wise that that could translate into for DRAM? And do you share the view that DRAM suppliers are remaining disciplined in capital spending during the period where pricing is pretty good? Any color would be helpful. Thanks. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. I can start and Gary can jump in. I'll tell you what's encouraging for me in some of this stuff. If you look at NAND and DRAM – look at NAND, I'll look at DRAM in a second. We look at NAND bit growth in supply is pretty much in line and growing about 45% a year, and that's 45% over a bigger and bigger install base. So the end-use demand for NAND is pretty damn strong. And DRAM is pretty similar. We see bit demand in 2016 up about 30%, and then we see server DRAM up about 40% to 45% in 2017. And supply has been a little tighter. We see 2017 supply bit growth is only about 25% to 30%, and then we see a lot of smartphone consumption up for new Android 6GB and Apple third-generation. But what's good for Applied is our market share within DRAM is up about 5 points from 2012 to 2015, and we think we're going to get another point in 2016. So we think, one, the marketing demand for DRAM and NAND is growing pretty healthily. Two, it's growing pretty disciplined, more frankly. Even with NAND capacity additions, what we see is big demand drivers for more NAND. For instance, another factoid I don't think we gave you is that as solid-state drives become more and more cost-effective, there's probably going to be a need for up to about 500,000 more wafer starts greenfield to add capacity to what they have today. In other words, if you look in the world, there used to be about 1.4 million wafer starts for NAND. Now it might be 1.6 million wafer starts. But that's not even enough. Over the next four years, they probably have to add another 500,000 just for servers. Each 100,000 of NAND is worth about $5 billion. That's about $5 billion that they have to add to reach their growth in their markets. So what's the point? Good growth drivers for NAND and DRAM, number one. Number two, pretty disciplined even with the capacity to do it on NAND because their market is expanding. Three, our position has gone up where we've gained by the time we're done in 2016 we'll probably have gained about seven points in both NAND and DRAM from 2012. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Okay, great. So thanks for that question. And then, Bob, if you'd like to, summarize it all before we close the call. Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc. We talk about a lot of esoteric stuff here, bit growth and materials engineering. When I step back, even more than a few years ago, I think Applied has a really good business. If you look at the markets in which we compete are doing really well, better than they were years ago. Our position is much better. And as somebody answered on the call, our better execution and less volatility of the market is resulting in significant improvement in operating margin to cash flow. So we have a really good business. And what we're doing here is driving sustainable year-over-year growth in revenue, share, and profitabilities. So the three things, as I would summarize again, is one, our markets are getting better, bigger, and less volatile. WFE and display are both strong with positive long-term outlook. We have strong share, as I said, in all device types. We were up in memory in particular. In foundry, we've always been strong. And then display is doing very well. And if you look at our service business, which was $2 billion back in 2013, we're going to hit $3.2 billion in 2019, so that's grown a lot, and that's a very strong baseline business. Second, our execution is better. Our deep pipeline of products enabled by the product development engine, where 40% of our equipment revenue now is generated from products we've introduced in the last three years, we have multiple years of share gains. And what I don't think we mentioned on our call, we have record backlog of $5.5 billion at this point. So that's all around better execution. And finally, the question I just got asked, billing, your return on cash is better than ever. Revenue is outpacing our markets. Operating margin is growing. As I said, we're going to be over 27% next year, and we have a great deal of flexibility to return more cash to shareholders. So I just think Applied has got a really good business when you cut through it. I feel really good about the business. Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc. Great, okay. Hey, thanks, Bob. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of our call is going to be available on the website beginning at 5:00 PM Pacific.

My name is Derek, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's first quarter financial results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc. Thanks, Derek, and good afternoon, everybody. So first of all, thank you for taking the time to participate in our conference call today to review our operating performance for the first quarter of 2017. Before we begin, I would like to extend a warm welcome to those who are new in their coverage of Amgen, including Umer Raffat of ISI Evercore and Carter Gould of UBS. Each of us very much look forward to working with you. We made a lot of progress during the quarter both in our commercial execution as well as our R&D efforts, so I'm anxious to get started. I would urge you to listen for specific themes, including volume-driven growth and operational expense management as you hear our senior leaders describe our performance. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will lead the call today with a brief report on how we are executing against our long-term strategy for growth. Following Bob, our CFO, David Meline, will review our financial results for the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2017. Our head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will then discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. And I'll give you a heads-up right now that we have a lot to discuss on our R&D efforts. As is customary for us, we will use slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful in understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results, and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release on Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website. Just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements, and our 2016 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Okay, thank you, Arvind, and thank you all for joining our call. It's been an active first quarter at Amgen. And before talking about our financial results, I want to put the events of the first 90 days of the year in context because I think they underscore the reasons why we're confident about achieving our long-term objectives for growth. As you know, we're focused on six therapeutic categories. And during the quarter, we achieved important milestones in each of them. Core to our strategy is a commitment to differentiated innovation. We aim for products with a big effect size in areas where the unmet need is high. That's what we feel will be required to succeed over the long term in this industry. In our cardiovascular portfolio, we strongly believe Repatha represents one such product. As all of you know, cardiovascular disease poses by far the biggest health burden on society today. And our outcomes data demonstrated unequivocally that Repatha can play an important role in reducing that burden. And the data also showed to my mind that the rate of cardiovascular events, which approached 10% per year in the optimized statin arm of the trial, is still far too high without Repatha. Against this backdrop, we expect Repatha to be an important product in the fight against cardiovascular disease and increasingly expect physicians, patients, and other stakeholders to recognize that rejecting an innovative drug for high-risk patients which demonstrated beyond 12 months a 35% reduction in the risk of heart attack, a 24% reduction in the rate of stroke, and a 28% reduction in the rate of revascularizations is simply inappropriate. The practice of medicine won't change overnight but it won't stall either, not in the face of an innovative new therapy that can prevent hundreds of thousands of otherwise needless and tragic events. In the U.S. alone, cardiovascular disease costs our society in excess of $600 billion a year. And without meaningful innovation like Repatha to change the trajectory of this disease, those costs will exceed $1.2 trillion by 2035. We believe it's right to embrace innovation not only for patients but also for society. Economic study after study has shown that society benefits financially from adopting therapies like Repatha. Nonetheless, we recognize the access challenges of the day, and that's why we have and will continue to offer innovative value-based contracts to help build a bridge between the medical need and the affordability concerns for patients and payers. In addition to novel biology, intellectual property is another source of differentiation for our innovation. We were obviously gratified this quarter by the Delaware court's support for our position on Repatha, and we now stand ready for the Appeals Court to hear the case in June. In oncology, there's no better standard for differentiated innovation than achieving an overall survival advantage for patients. In the first quarter, we achieved that with both KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO. The BLINCYTO results are encouraging for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia obviously. But more broadly, they are encouraging as validation for the whole approach of our immuno-oncology BiTE platform. Perhaps because we are the only company with an advanced BiTE platform, this area is not as well understood in the investment community as other areas of immuno-oncology, but we're excited about the potential of our BiTEs and have several programs moving swiftly in our pipeline. We look forward to sharing data as they become available from these efforts. The overall survival data for KYPROLIS achieved at an interim analysis in relapsed multiple myeloma patients are also very important and timely. Having established superiority versus Velcade, we expect these data will drive increased share for KYPROLIS, particularly in the second line, and will also be helpful for reimbursement considerations. Also in multiple myeloma this quarter, we achieved positive results for XGEVA. And subject to regulatory approvals, we look forward to being able to offer this therapy to multiple myeloma patients, many of whom are at risk of skeletal-related events such as those prevented by XGEVA. Bone health remains an area of high unmet medical need, as still millions of women at high risk for postmenopausal fractures remain untreated. Reflecting on the number of postmenopausal fractures, the World Health Organization called this a global epidemic. Prolia's ongoing significant volume-driven growth, 21% in the quarter, attests to the value of differentiated innovation in this field. Already the leader in bone health, we expect EVENITY will strengthen our hand. And while we await both further clinical data and regulatory reviews, Sean will describe the encouraging results that we received this quarter for the three-year follow-up from the FRAME study. While discussing our strategy of differentiated innovation, I also want to address our newest therapeutic area, which is of course neuroscience, where we are on the threshold of a novel first-in-class therapy for migraine sufferers. We had the opportunity to present our registration-enabling data at the American Academy of Neurology this week. And not surprisingly, experts in the field were excited about erenumab in an area where there is otherwise precious little to offer those suffering from episodic and chronic migraine. I've seen some headlines asking whether our expanded collaboration with Novartis signals a waning of our enthusiasm for this opportunity. The answer is absolutely not. We have high hopes for erenumab. And at the same time, we recognize this is a new therapeutic category for us and will likely be a competitive race. So we were very pleased that Novartis, already our collaborator in international markets, shared our enthusiasm for this first-in-class molecule in the U.S. and our determination to resource this product to win. With their decades of experience in neurology and a shared commitment to serve those suffering from migraine, we're excited about our expanded collaboration. When it comes to strategy, you've also heard us talk about life cycle management, especially for our legacy franchises. The Neulasta Onpro launch is now widely seen as one of the most effective examples of this, with market shares now in excess of 50% in the U.S. In nephrology, we announced earlier this quarter an extension of our partnership with DaVita for EPOGEN. And of course, we also gained approval for Parsabiv in the U.S. As the established leader in nephrology therapeutics, we continue to look for ways to serve patients with kidney disease and expect this to remain an important franchise for us. As you know, an element of our strategy includes developing a portfolio of biosimilars, and I'm glad that we made that commitment, as I think there will be a robust market for these products. And while our portfolio of 10 biosimilars is progressing across the board, the highlight for the quarter was in inflammation, where we received EU approval to go along with our U.S. approval of AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to Humira. The first steps in building out this business are to establish biosimilarity and gain registration, and obviously we have done that now for an important molecule in the biggest markets. The next step is to navigate the IP landscape, and the process for that is underway. Over the past couple of years, we've talked on these calls about our ongoing transformation efforts. We committed to a companywide transformation, real, meaningful change designed to make us more competitive, improve our operating margins, and ensure that we would be in a strong position to return capital to our shareholders during this period of increasing competition for our legacy franchises and while launching nine innovative products, maintaining our investment in innovation, advancing our biosimilars portfolio, and expanding our international presence from 50 to over 100 countries. We have asked a lot of our staff, and they have delivered. In our past results, you've seen our steady progress, and you see it once again this quarter, where our margins have grown and we delivered 9% earnings per share growth. Looking forward, our orientation is long-term growth with volume-driven products, and we think we can deliver that across our focused therapeutic franchises. But we're also set on managing the business tightly to deliver in the short and medium term too. You should see this in our track record, and that's what you see in this quarter as well. Our balance sheet and cash flows are strong, and we're looking for investment opportunities, albeit with a determination to add value for our shareholders, not just someone else's. Given valuations across many targets in the sector at the moment, that's challenging, but we'll remain patient and discriminating when it comes to M&A. We've long advocated the need for corporate tax reform. If innovative U.S. companies are to remain competitive, we need a level tax playing field. We don't have one now, but we're hopeful this administration will deliver that in 2017. Obviously, we think such change would improve our flexibility for capital allocation. I've taken a bit longer than usual on this call, but with all of the events of the first quarter, I wanted to make sure to reiterate that we're investing in long-term opportunities, managing the business tightly, and are poised to capitalize on investment opportunities which might arise. With that, let me once again thank our staff for their engagement with our mission, and then turn to David. Thank you. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Bob. We were pleased with our solid overall results and earnings growth again in the first quarter, as our transformation efforts enabled progress in an environment of strong competition and portfolio transition. We also were encouraged by our 7% volume growth in Europe, reflecting the value of our innovative products in a market where we have experienced similar competition and portfolio transition for a number of years. Turning to the financial results on page 6 of the slide deck, worldwide revenues at $5.5 billion in the first quarter are flat year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and are 1% lower on a reported basis including FX. Worldwide product sales at $5.2 billion in the first quarter are flat year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and are 1% lower on a reported basis including FX, as strong unit demand for our newer products was offset by declines in our mature brands. Other revenues at $265 million decreased $23 million versus the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP operating income at $3 billion grew 5% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by 3 points to 57.6% for the quarter, reflecting continued favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories and the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payments in Q4 of 2016. As in prior years, our operating margin is expected to be lower in the remaining quarters of the year, driven by the timing of expenses. On an overall full-year basis, we expect another year of strong operating margins, driven by tight operational expense management. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 0.4 points to 13.1%, driven by manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by product mix. Research and development expenses at $748 million were down 13% year over year, driven by a first quarter 2016 payment related to a third-party collaboration agreement, lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs, and continued benefits from our transformation initiatives. Research and development as a percent of product sales at 14.4% is lower in Q1, consistent with previous years. Going forward, research and development expense as a percent of product sales is expected to normalize around 2016 levels. SG&A expenses decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis due to the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payments, partially offset by increased investments in new product launches. In aggregate, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 7% year over year and remain on track to meet or exceed our 2018 commitment of $1.5 billion in transformation savings, while investing to build the business globally, support new product launches, and invest in the long-term pipeline for the business. Other income and expenses were a net $131 million expense in Q1. This is favorable by $13 million on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by higher cash balances. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.5% for the quarter, a 0.4-point decrease versus the first quarter of 2016. This decrease reflects favorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by a smaller benefit from share-based compensation tax expenses compared to the first quarter of last year. As you may recall, this benefit is a result of the adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-9, requiring these tax impacts to be recognized on the income statement versus the balance sheet. The benefit of this adoption contributed approximately $0.06 to our non-GAAP earnings per share in this quarter compared to $0.09 in the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income increased 6%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 9% year over year for the first quarter to $3.15 per share. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 7, free cash flow was $2.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $400 million over last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher profitability as well as timing impacts of income tax payments to the IRS. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders, consistent with our commitments, as we deployed $0.6 billion to repurchase 3.4 million shares at an average of $163 per share, and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, as previously communicated. Additionally, our first quarter dividend increased to $1.15 per share, an increase of 15% over last year. Cash and investments totaled $38.4 billion, an increase of approximately $3.7 billion from the first quarter of last year. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow generation. Our debt balance stands at $34.1 billion as of March 31, carrying a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% and an average maturity of 12 years. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2017 on page 8, overall our 2017 revenue guidance remains unchanged at $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion. Our first quarter volume and price performance was in line with our plans, as we experienced a solid contribution from our newer products while managing the impact of competition against the balance of the portfolio. Revenue guidance also reflects the potential impact of the Repatha litigation and improving access for appropriate patients as a result of the positive Repatha cardiovascular outcomes data. Finally, our guidance takes into account potential biosimilar competition against Neulasta commencing as soon as the fourth quarter of this year. With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we are raising the outlook to $12.00 to $12.60, reflecting our overall solid Q1 performance. In addition, our non-GAAP tax rate guidance remains unchanged at 18.5% to 19.5%, and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year. As previously stated, our 2017 guidance ranges are based on application of existing laws, including the Affordable Care Act and the current U.S. tax code as well as current interpretation of the required notice period prior to commercial marketing of a biosimilar under the BPCIA [Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act]. We will continue to update guidance going forward for changes in these factors and any other business updates. Finally, consistent with our 2017 outlook, we remain confident we will meet or exceed the commitments provided for the 2014 to 2018 period, including: double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth; non-GAAP operating margin improvement from 38% to 52% to 54%; $1.5 billion of transformation savings; and return to shareholders of at least 60% of non-GAAP net income on average during the period. This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. You'll find our product sales starting on slide number 10. Our business performance is shifting to a more volume-driven growth as we launch innovative products targeting the large patient populations with unmet medical needs. Whilst our focus is on innovation, we have also executed effective life cycle management strategies for some of our legacy brands which are facing potential new competition. Although U.S. revenues declined 1%, our ex-U.S. growth was 3%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, fueled by a 7% volume growth. I'll now discuss our specific product performance and will structure my comments by therapeutic area. Let me begin with our bone health franchise. Prolia is a great example of one of our innovative products that realized robust volume growth during the quarter, with most of its 21% year-over-year sales growth driven by unit volume. Prolia, with a strong value proposition, is uniquely positioned in postmenopausal osteoporosis as the leading branded product on the market. We will continue to invest in Prolia to reach a greater number of patients whilst reinforcing adherence for those already taking Prolia to ensure they continue to realize its benefits. Overall, we expect Prolia will remain a significant growth driver, as the approximately 850,000 U.S. patients on Prolia therapy only represent about 20% of patients presently being treated for postmenopausal osteoporosis. We also look forward to expanding our bone health franchise with romosozumab, our innovative bone-building molecule for which we now have a trade name, EVENITY. In conjunction with our partners at UCB, we're preparing for a U.S. launch in advance of the July 19 PDUFA date. As Bob pointed out, having the ability to co-position EVENITY and Prolia sequentially will improve our ability to better treat those large patient populations. For thousands of high-risk postmenopausal osteoporosis patients such as those who have fractured, we have a proven therapeutic strategy with EVENITY to first build strong new bone in patients with 12 months of treatment, followed by Prolia for proven continued fracture risk reduction. Oncology is another area that is benefiting from volume growth with our recently launched products. Let me start with KYPROLIS. KYPROLIS realized 23% year-on-year growth during the quarter. And most of this growth was volume-driven, including our international markets. As you know, KYPROLIS is indicated in the U.S. for second and third-line multiple myeloma. In second-line, triplet regimens are used in approximately one-third of patients. And despite new entrants, we've been able to achieve about 50% market share for new patient starts in this segment. The other two-thirds of second-line patients are treated with doublet regimens. And recent data from our ENDEAVOR study had demonstrated that KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone improved overall survival by 21% or nearly 8 months when compared to the Velcade plus dexamethasone. Improving overall survival is the gold standard measurement when treating cancer. This data clearly establishes KYPROLIS as the proteasome inhibitor of choice and will be a compelling differentiator in our strategy to displace Velcade in this setting. KYPROLIS is well accepted in large academic centers that treat high numbers of multiple myeloma patients. And we are now focusing on extending KYPROLIS's reach into the community oncology practices. Despite the introduction of new competing products in the U.S., we have also regained share in new third-line patients over the last few quarters. We expect proteasome inhibition to be foundational therapy in multiple myeloma for many years to come and are focused on growing in second and third lines of therapy with plans to expand KYPROLIS's use in newly diagnosed patients. Outside the U.S., we continue to enter into new markets and secure reimbursement with the benefit of the new KYPROLIS overall survival data. XGEVA grew 6% year over year, mostly due to volume, as we continue to emphasize its clinical benefits. We look forward to having the positive multiple myeloma study data added to our label. This will expand the patient population eligible for XGEVA treatment. Both Nplate and Vectibix saw another good quarter of volume growth of 9% and 6% respectively. Neulasta sales increased 2% year over year, as we continue to see a small decline in the use of myelosuppressive chemotherapeutic agents. The first quarter also benefited from accounting estimate changes due to lower Onpro returns, underscoring that Onpro delivery is working better than initially assumed. We continue to drive increasing adoption, and Onpro now represents over 50% share of all Neulasta purchases. This has been a great example of a very successful life cycle management strategy. And as David explained earlier, we expect minimal impact in 2017 from potential long-acting biosimilar competition. I'd also note that the first quarter historically benefits from heavier purchasing by certain end customers, and we estimate this benefit in quarter one to be about $50 million, which we expect to reverse in quarter two. For NEUPOGEN, the impact of competition was in line with prior performance. We entered the quarter retaining a 46% share of the short-acting market in the U.S. We expect these competitive dynamics to continue over the course of 2017. Moving now to Enbrel, I would start by emphasizing that we see no trend break versus 2016. And I will go through Enbrel carefully and in some detail because I don't want you to misinterpret long-term dynamics based on some quarter one peculiarities. Before getting into quarterly performance, I'd like to highlight that we utilize IMS prescription data to analyze the business. Like many of you, we noticed a slowdown in the first quarter IMS scripts. This has implications for our views on segment demand and end-user inventory levels. We've been in close contact with IMS, and they agree that the first quarter prescription data appears soft in several specialty product categories, including rheumatology and dermatology. As a matter of fact, on a year-over-year basis, unit growth in rheumatology appeared to slow from 9% in the first quarter of 2016 to 2% in this quarter, and from 25% to 9% in the dermatology segment for the same period. IMS attributes the softness to a combination of several factors, including the number of shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the first quarter of 2017, the impact of patient out-of-pocket costs including deductibles, and the Part D donut hole for the start of a new year, as well as the potential increasing use of 90-day prescriptions. This is also consistent with our view of the market. We noted our expectations that 2016 trends would continue into 2017. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our share declined 1 percentage point to 32% in rheumatology and declined 2 percentage points in dermatology to 15%, in line with 2016 share trends. As for the end-user inventory, we previously said that we expected quarter one reductions due to the quarter four 2016 $150 million excess inventory. Based on the IMS data, we calculated an approximate $30 million reduction in inventory levels this quarter. And therefore, we expect the remainder to be used up during the course of the year. Obviously, the accuracy of the IMS data has implications for understanding of both unit demand dynamics and end-user inventory. Consistent with our previous guidance, net selling price had a minimal impact on year-over-year sales growth during quarter one. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, we are seeing increased commercial patient copay assistance impacting their selling price, which is likely a function of higher patient out-of-pocket costs. This impact typically tapers off over the remainder of the year, and our view on net selling price in 2017 is unchanged. We are optimistic about a rebound in both Enbrel and Enbrel segment growth in future quarters, as IMS prescription data from the more recent weeks shows improvement versus the beginning of the year in both rheumatology and dermatology. So in summary, the quarter one results likely reflect a temporary marketplace issue, and we believe the long-term dynamics are intact and in line with our prior expectations. There remain a substantial number of patients for which Enbrel is the best treatment option given its competitive efficacy and long-term safety profile. We will continue to invest in Enbrel to enhance its value it brings to patients and providers. Given its long-term period of patent protection, Enbrel will continue to be a significant cash flow generator for Amgen for many years to come. Turning now to our nephrology products, beginning with Aranesp, on a worldwide basis, Aranesp declined 4% year over year. In the U.S., it increased by 7%, including the conversion from EPOGEN at numerous independent and midsize dialysis centers. This conversion was substantially completed by quarter three of 2016, with Aranesp now representing over 85% of the ESA usage. Performance outside the U.S. was negatively impacted by foreign exchange as well as the timing of tenders in certain markets. Now to EPOGEN, as previously disclosed, we recently renegotiated our supply agreement with DaVita. DaVita represents about one-third of the U.S. dialysis market, and they will continue to predominantly purchase EPOGEN through 2022. In exchange for longer supply certainty, we made concessions on net selling prices, which impacted the quarter-on-quarter results. Also, as David mentioned, we do not expect a material impact to our ESA business in 2017 from a short-acting biosimilar competitor. Sensipar increased 15% year over year, driven by a combination of net selling price and volume growth. Parsabiv, our innovative new cosmetic, delivered intravenously, is now approved in both the U.S. and Europe. And we are working with CMS to secure a reimbursement mechanism in the U.S. Let me now turn to our cardiovascular franchise and Repatha. Let me first address the quarter-on-quarter growth, which might look a little strange. Quarter four 2016 was slightly inflated due to the booking of a Middle East tender, which was not repeated in quarter one this year. With closer examination of the data, you will see that we recorded positive volume growth in the U.S. of 14% and 28% in Europe. In the U.S., we achieved segment share of 64% in quarter one for new-to-brand patients and briefly touched on 70% as we exited the quarter. In Europe, we exited 2016 with 56% segment share. Our U.S. formulary coverage has greatly improved over last year, especially in Medicare Part D, where we have almost tripled the number of lives covered. Results of the Repatha cardiovascular outcomes study that were presented at the American College of Cardiology last month are clearly a game-changer for cardiovascular patients, showing significant reductions in MIs and strokes. We also shared our analysis on the economic value of Repatha at the ACC. This calculation used standard peer-reviewed methodology, using real-world event rates and imputed mortality benefit from the meta-analysis of previous studies, the CTTC relationship, and concluded that prices in the market today are well within the value-based price range. Naturally, this calculation is based on average net selling price and not the list price. Since the ACC, we've been engaging with payers in the U.S. and across the world on Repatha's clinical data and economic value. We are in active discussions with all of the large U.S. PBMs and payers, and they recognize the importance of Repatha's outcome data to patients. We are focused on reducing barriers and improving processes to make it easier for a physician to prescribe Repatha and for patients to get access to this important therapy. We expect payers will start changing utilization management criteria and processes over the coming months. Several independent groups have studied the access situation and have concluded that current access barriers are inappropriate and potentially harmful to patients. As pointed out in the recent publication by the Partnership for Health Analytic Research, or PHAR, it started with the irresponsible prediction of healthcare costs prior to FDA approval of the PCSK9 inhibitor class. These overestimates resulted in onerous restrictions and lack of patient access from the beginning. At the ACC last month, two research teams, including one from Duke, presented data showing that patients' clinical characteristics were no different between those denied reimbursement for PCSK9 versus those approved, showing that payer utilization management processes were nothing but an arbitrary barrier to access. And just today, the FH Foundation published a peer-reviewed paper in the journal Circulation showing that 63% of FH patients and 58% of established ASCVD patients had their PCSK9 inhibitor claims rejected despite having suboptimal LDL-C levels and being on moderate or high-intensity statins. Cardiovascular disease continues to be the number-one cause of death and disability in the world. And in a moment, Sean will remind us of the incredible outcome value that Repatha has demonstrated by its ability to reduce both MI and stroke. This data together with the groundswell of cardiology and patient pressure will result in increasing levels of patient access. Repatha will continue to grow for many years to come, making it one of the largest innovative assets Amgen has brought to market. Let me conclude by saying a few words about erenumab and our recently announced expanded collaboration with Novartis. We believe that partnering with Novartis, a company that is well-positioned in the neuroscience space, will enable us to maximize the launch of this first-in-class product. We believe that erenumab will offer a strong value proposition to millions of patients suffering from chronic or episodic migraines. Let me close by thanking all the Amgen staff that worked so hard and tirelessly to get our important products to patients around the world. Sean? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. I'll begin my comments today with Repatha. As you know, we presented the results of our Repatha cardiovascular outcomes study at the American College of Cardiology meetings in March with simultaneous publication in The New England Journal of Medicine. This represented a major step on the path of getting this therapy to the patients who so desperately need it. The study had several objectives: first, to validate the PCSK9 mechanism with respect to cardiovascular outcomes; second, to establish the safety of reaching unprecedented low LDL levels, recall that 25% of patients in the Repatha arm had on-treatment LDLs below 19; and third, to understand whether the linear relationship established by statins and ezetimibe between LDL and cardiovascular risk continues down to very low LDL levels, as the human genetics had suggested. This study gave clear positive results on all of these objectives. The results also validated our dosing approach of maximally inhibiting PCSK9 with Repatha, and that when it comes to LDL, as we began to hear cardiologists coin at the ACC, lowest is best. Importantly, outcomes data from Pfizer's discontinued PCSK9 program were presented and also published in The New England Journal of Medicine, confirming the efficacy seen in our study and demonstrating that not all PCSK9 antibody therapies are the same with respect to off-target liabilities. Now there's been a fair amount of speculation in the press and elsewhere about the magnitude of the risk reduction observed in our study, so I'm going to spend a bit of time on the results. We have found that the vast preponderance of experts in this field view this study as highly successful in terms of the observed effect size. Essentially, the results are exactly as what would have been achieved had one been able to reduce LDL to the same degree with additional statin therapy were it possible to do so without unacceptable toxicity. Specifically, experts understand that the treatment lag that occurs in the first year of therapy, a phenomenon seen in all lipid-lowering trials in this type of population, represented a much larger proportion of the median time on therapy in our study, which was just over two years, versus the average 5.5-year-long statin study. They also understand that adjusting appropriately for duration of therapy, the results line up extremely well with the cholesterol treatment trial as a collaboration or CTTC meta analyses. When one looks at the pre-specified landmark analyses for this chronic therapy, after the first year when the treatment lag is over and the true chronic value of the therapy can be assessed accurately, the risk reductions in myocardial infarction 35%, stroke 24%, and revascularization 28% are quite impressive, particularly in the setting of such a remarkably clean safety profile. Experts also understand why one should not have anticipated an impact on CV mortality in such a study, and I would refer those who are interested to an excellent editorial on this subject published recently in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology. And to just remind us of the clinical reality here, many millions of patients like those in our outcome studies have a high annual risk of CV events, despite maximally tolerated statins, and have no other therapeutic alternative to take their LDLs down to levels that significantly protect them from such events. In fact, we were all surprised by the fact that despite optimized therapy with best standard of care, including high-intensity statins, patients in the placebo arm of our CV outcome study had an annual event rate of almost 10%, which clearly demonstrates the unmet need here, as event rates in the real world are significantly higher than those seen in clinical trial settings. Now one of our highest priorities is to ensure these results are reflected in the Repatha label as soon as possible, and we're targeting regulatory submissions by midyear. I'd also note that the Repatha 420-milligram single-dose delivery option was recently approved in Europe. Turning to oncology, we completed XGEVA regulatory submissions in the U.S. and Europe for the prevention of skeletal-related events in multiple myeloma patients, providing a potential new treatment option for patients, many of whom are not able to avail themselves of alternative therapies due to renal insufficiency. In multiple myeloma, we received the overall survival data from the ENDEAVOR study in relapsed or refractory patients, which confirm the superiority of KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone over Velcade plus dexamethasone. In fact, ENDEAVOR was the first head-to-head study to demonstrate a survival benefit versus a current standard-of-care regimen in this setting, and we're preparing to submit these results to regulators as well. We also remain on track to begin enrollment this quarter in our Phase 3 study of KYPROLIS in combination with DARZALEX in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and also recently began enrolling a Phase 1b study of new formulations of oprozomib. Turning to our immuno-oncology programs, I'll begin with our BiTE platform. We were very pleased that FDA granted BLINCYTO Priority Review for our recent sBLA that includes overall survival data from our Phase 3 study to support conversion from accelerated to full approval. The application also includes new data in Philadelphia chromosome-positive relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a small population but an area of significant unmet need. We also continued to roll out our Phase 2/3 BLINCYTO program in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common form of high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We also had the opportunity in the recent American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting to present preclinical data from some of our new BiTE programs, including half-life extended constructs. We continue to make good progress with the investigation of Enlogic in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, and we'll be presenting the results of our Phase 2 study in combination with Yervoy at ASCO as well as some very interesting human biomarker data at the Congress of the European Association of Dermato Oncology. Finally, in the early-stage immuno-oncology pipeline, we're making progress on our Advaxis collaboration and have an investigational new drug application in place for a personalized neo-antigen-targeted approach to cancer immunotherapy. In our bone therapeutic area, our collaboration with UCB on EVENITY continues to advance, and we look forward to our July U.S. PDUFA date for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. Ahead of this, we expect the primary analysis of our active controlled fracture study, ARCH, in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in the near future. I will remind you that the upcoming primary analysis will include the clinical fracture and vertebral fracture primary co-endpoints as well as an interim analysis of the event-driven non-vertebral fracture study secondary endpoint. If statistical significance is not achieved at this interim analysis, the study will continue until the final analysis some months later. We designed ARCH in this manner to ensure adequate powering at the non-vertebral fracture endpoint. I would also point out that compared to the placebo-controlled FRAME study, the ARCH study compares EVENITY followed by alendronate to antiresorptive therapy with alendronate throughout the study period. These sequences are being assessed in a higher-risk population than our FRAME study, with all subjects in ARCH required to have prevalent fracture. This was possible given the active comparator design, and we were not exposing these higher-risk patients to placebo. If you recall in the FRAME study, the event rate for non-vertebral fractures was much lower than expected. And at 12 months, the non-vertebral relative risk reduction was 25% in the EVENITY-treated patients but was not significantly significant. In an exploratory analysis reported at ASBMR [American Society for Bone and Mineral Research], the relative risk reduction at two years in FRAME was 25% with a nominal T-value that was less than 0.05. We recently conducted the three-year analysis of this study, which again demonstrated nominal significance for non-vertebral fracture, demonstrating that a year of EVENITY therapy still had high treatment impact through year three, despite the fact that the control group received a very potent antiresorptive agent, Prolia, in years two and three. Within our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis, we had the opportunity to present the results from our two Phase 3 erenumab studies in episodic migraine at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting yesterday. The data demonstrated the robust and consistent effect of inhibiting the CGRP receptor with erenumab. And feedback from experts at the meeting have been very positive, with many viewing this as a potentially game-changing therapy for a debilitating, highly symptomatic disease. We look forward to making first-in-class regulatory submissions for erenumab that incorporate our episodic and chronic data later this quarter. AMG 301, our PAC-1 antibody for migraine, also continues to progress. We've seen encouraging pharmacodynamic activity in our Phase 1 study in normal subjects and are currently designing a Phase 2 program in migraineurs, which we expect to begin later this year. Also in the quarter, Phase 3 enrollment in Alzheimer's disease began for the small molecule BACE inhibitor, AMG 520, we are developing with Novartis. In our inflammation collaboration with AstraZeneca-MedImmune, I am pleased to provide a program update for AMG 157 or tezepelumab, our monoclonal antibody that inhibits thymic stromal lymphopoietin or TSLP. TSLP is an epithelial-derived cytokine produced in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli that drives inflammatory responses. TSLP expression is increased in the airways of patients with asthma, the magnitude correlating with the severity of disease. Some of you may recall that our Phase 1b data were quite compelling and were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2014. Together with AZ-MedImmune, we've now received the results from a large double-blind Phase 2b study in patients with inadequately controlled severe asthma in which AMG 157 demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations compared to placebo at 52 weeks, successfully meeting the primary endpoint. This is a very encouraging result. And together with AZ-MedImmune, we are currently evaluating the potential for this agent to address a broad population of patients with severe asthma. Briefly in nephrology, in the first quarter we also received approval for Parsabiv, our innovative IV calcimimetic that is administered thrice weekly at the end of dialysis for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease. And lastly in biosimilar news from Europe, we received approval for AMGEVITA, our biosimilar Humira, for all available indications and submitted ABP 980, our biosimilar Herceptin, for approval. In closing, I'd like to acknowledge our staff for advancing these important programs on behalf of patients. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Okay, thank you, Sean. I know we've taken more time than usual on our introductory remarks, so let's go straight to questions, Derek, and just please remind our callers of the process for the next step. Question-and-Answer Session Operator And your first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence, begin your question. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, thanks for taking the question, maybe just a two-part on Repatha. First, Tony, can you comment if the payers appreciate the details of the four-year data that Sean walked through? And then it looks like net price might have taken a step down in the U.S. in the first quarter. I'm just wondering if you can confirm that and any additional commentary that you can provide. Thank you. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Terence, sure. All our discussions with the payers have been really starting with the discussion on the Repatha outcomes data, and I don't think we've had any pushback at all in terms of people really understanding the robust value. We will continue to work with them. Obviously, each one of them has agreed to go back and relook at the utilization management criteria as we speak. There does appear to be a slight adjustment in the net price. One was due to a small accounting adjustment. And two, of course, we book our patient copay program to the net price, and the first quarter is normally a lot higher than second, third, or fourth. So we see that normalizing as we go forward. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Can we go to the next question? Operator And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew, you may begin your question. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great, thanks for taking the question. Tony, thanks for the detail on Enbrel. I'm sure, as you appreciate, there's a lot of questions that people have on that. If I can just ask two points there, you cited a market slowdown which you think will improve throughout the rest of the year. Could you just talk about your confidence around that? And beyond some of the weekly data points, are there other reasons to believe that broadly the market is not slowing? And then second, it seems to me that the impact on price in the first quarter is higher than you've seen in quarters past, even when thinking about copay assistance and some of the other factors. Is there anything else going on there, and what's your confidence about price leveling out for the year? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Thanks, Matt. So as you know, with Enbrel as a retail product, about 97% of the volume is reported on a script basis, so we can track it quite tightly. For the quarter, it was definitely down, both rheumatology and dermatology. When I look at it sequentially, January, February, March, and then as I see it going into April, each one of those months has shown an incremental growth both in terms of DOT as well as prescriptions and in terms of growth. So January was down a lot. February was better than January. March was better than February, and April is starting to look much better than March as well. From a net price, we don't see a dramatic change in the net price. Some the new contracts are coming into place, but our outlook on net price for 2017 hasn't changed at all. And when I look at abandonment rates, abandonment rates in the first quarter are pretty similar for Enbrel to what they were in the fourth quarter or the third quarter last year. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. And, Matthew, maybe just big picture here, when we look at the flow of patients into the information space, particularly rheumatology and dermatology, we see no reason in the marketplace that the trend of an increasing number of patients into this therapy would have abruptly changed between the fourth and the first quarter. So we think that we'll continue to see growth in the underlying demand for these kind of products. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying, you may begin your question. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on Repatha. How much have you heard from the physicians in terms of feedback that they have to wait for a treatment guideline change by, let's say, ACC or AHA before they start prescribing more Repatha? And if that's the case, when do you think those professional organizations will change the guideline? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I think it's probably a subtle question that you're asking there, Ying, so why don't we just take a moment and really step through it. Tony, why don't you go ahead and take the first go. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So all our discussions with cardiologists have been around their frustration of the administrative burden that has been placed upon them to get a prescription for appropriate patients. A lot of them are having to hire full-time nurses to spend the entire day chasing down required patient data, to chase down interactions between the patient or between the physician and the respective payer or the PBM. The guidelines themselves clearly in everyone's mind would help move the decision-making and the utilization criteria a bit quicker. But our major conversation with physicians is not really around the guidelines; it's more around the inconvenience. From a guideline perspective, clearly both the AHA and the ACC are busy looking at the outcomes data. They've told us they're busy identifying position papers they wish to put forward. The NLA, the National Lipid Association, was there. The Association of Preventive Cardiology (sic) [American Society of Preventive Cardiology] (54:25), run by Dr. Seth Baum, is in the process of looking at a revised set of guidelines, including a proposed set of utilization management criteria, which they're proposing the PBMs and the payers should be using. In terms of guidelines themselves, both the AHA and the ACC have said it will take some time before they actually get to a final guideline change. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I think the important information here is that the data demonstrated that lower is better, or as Sean said and as we increasingly hear from experts in the field, lowest is best. And I think people recognize that the current guidelines are out of sync with that. So the data make the point clear, and we expect to see white papers and then ultimately changes in the guidelines. But for right now, the data are an important piece of getting people to understand how to manage this disease for patients. Let's go to the next question. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen. Eric, you may begin your question. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC Thanks. Just as a follow-on to Ying's question, it sounds like the major bottleneck is this hassle factor, Tony, that physicians are being put through, and I guess I'm just wondering what kind of leverage Amgen has to reduce that factor. Can't payers just stay entrenched and say our policies are that we'll cover it, but we're going to make you go through X, Y, and Z hoops and maintain the hassle factor and I guess the evidence of better medicine? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So, Eric, I don't think I've spoken to a single cardiologist or general practitioner who hasn't commented on how onerous the process is to gain access to these products. I think without a doubt, the third-party organizations, the professional organizations such as the ACC, the AHA, as well as patient organizations such as the FH Foundation are the ones who are running the research work at the moment, including Duke, as I said. We actually looked at those patients who received a PCSK9 and those who didn't, and actually show there's no clinical difference in the patients themselves. This type of burden I think is going to start putting the pressure on the payers. Talking to the payers, they themselves are agreeing with us that the clinical data is important, and they need to expand access to appropriate patients. So we will continue to drive that interaction with them. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory, you may begin your question. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon. I have a pretty commercial question on erenumab. I wonder if you can comment on early interactions you're having with payers on that front or maybe just general market research for the product. I guess specifically, I'm wondering how much of an impediment you expect access to be in the early days of that pending launch and how much your research may have factored into the strategic decision to further engage with Novartis. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So let me start, Cory, by just telling you about an interaction I had with my counterpart at Novartis yesterday. He and I have both been in recent contact with neurologists who specialize in treating patients with chronic migraine. And the two of us are quite elated at the level of excitement we're seeing amongst these physicians about having for the first time in decades a treatment opportunity to really help people who have this debilitating disease. It truly is one of those symptomatic diseases where if you've got a migraine, you really know about it, and it impacts how you run your life. Can you run your life or can you be a good caregiver? We are starting our discussions with the payers right now. We are helping them see the data from a clinical perspective. Obviously, the real negotiation can only start once we have the label, and we look forward to having that in the next couple months or so. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Josh, you may begin your question. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thanks for taking the question. If you can, help us understand the market segmentation in asthma, really the issue with AMG 157 again versus some of the other novel biologics targeting the IL4 side pathways (58:46). Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Okay. The question was a little bit hard to hear, Josh, but I think, Sean, why don't you take the first crack at it? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, what I would say is that it's still early days for a lot of the therapies that are still in development. But as you look across the biologics landscape in asthma, there's a few things that are clear. One is that in aggregate, asthma is an enormous opportunity from the perspective of the unmet need and the number of patients who are, for example, having to take courses of oral corticosteroids throughout the course of the year to manage their disease, which is very problematic for them. And I think what you're seeing is that many of the mechanisms that are either out there now in biologics or being developed currently are segmented to populations that, for example, have high eosinophilic counts, atopic phenotype, et cetera. And in the case of TSLP, what we like about TSLP is it is a very upstream kind of a mediator of this inflammation. And our expectation is that we could have a very broad impact on patients with activity across the spectrum of patient phenotypes within the asthma disease spectrum, which would make it a very attractive therapeutic option. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny, you may begin your question. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Good evening and thank you for taking my question. I guess the Supreme Court have been looking at the biosimilar law today. In the case they side with you and find that shall means will, can you give us a feel for what will happen with the biosimilars that have already launched for Neulasta? Will they have to come back into the full patent dance? Essentially, if you win this case, what does it mean in terms of delay of biosimilar Neulasta approvals or launches? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I think there are a couple things in your question there, Ronny. Let me tease apart the two pieces of it. First, as you know, the Supreme Court reviewed this today, and so we'll know within a matter of weeks. Obviously, we think the 180-day needs to be enforced as it was written in the law. But with respect – I think you must have been referring to the short-acting competitors to NEUPOGEN. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC No, I was talking about the patent dance and impact of Neulasta biosimilar launches. Essentially, if you win that, will the biosimilar Neulasta be delayed? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I guess I'm not sure what you mean by delayed. I think again, the big picture here, Ronny, is that we've known for some time that we'll face biosimilar competition. We're expecting that that will happen for Neulasta, and we're ready for that. You've seen the actions that we've been taking over the past couple years to be ready for that. And we're ready to embrace the competition, and we've positioned the company from an operating expense standpoint with the knowledge that that competition is coming, and we're launching medicines and entering markets that we think will help us grow beyond that. So the 180-day is obviously post-FDA approval, so we're watching different competitive products make their way through the regulatory pathway. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc. If I could then, in terms of the guidance we've offered, there are none that have been approved yet to compete with Neulasta. There's one that's lined up I think in the third quarter here. So if it were approved and the 180-day stands, then that would imply, as we've indicated, that we could face competition as soon as late this year, and that's how our guidance is built right now. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Yes. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Alethia, you may begin your question. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just again on Neulasta, I know Onpro is picking up momentum. But I'm just trying to figure out if you think – how do you think this helps defend you against biosimilar share? Is it as simple as that the market is remodeling itself, and so it delays and prolongs some of the competition that you may see, or is there some other dynamic we should be aware of? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Alethia, it's Tony. So let me go back to a comment I made on the last quarter earnings. Let's use MD Anderson as an example of probably one of the premier large oncology teaching centers in the country. It took MD Anderson almost – just over 12 months to go through their P&T committee to get an agreement within the institution to start shifting patients to Onpro. And the rationale was they were really having a good look at the clinical value, the treatment protocols, the discharge protocols, and they finally agreed that this product was certainly worthwhile having. We spent a number of weeks training their 600 oncology nurses so they were able to really identify the right patient, administer the drug before patients went home, and they have therefore changed the clinical practice. The feedback we get from both the oncology nurses, the oncologists themselves, and patients in fact about the fact they no longer have to come back 24 hours later or a day after their chemotherapy when they're in the middle of chemo-induced nausea and vomiting is a huge advantage and allows them a better quality of life. So we really believe that the benefit this drug brings is not simply a device. It is really something that allows patients to continue to live their lives whilst being treated for cancer. It also has resulted in changes, definitive changes in discharge protocols, which we think will take some time to be reversed if there's no other alternative. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Yes, it's worth keeping in mind the big picture here, Alethia. There's some data in a peer review publication from this week recognizing that there are 100,000 hospitalizations a year in this country from patients who suffer from an infection while undergoing chemotherapy, and of course that's what NEUPOGEN and Neulasta are designed to address. And any product like Onpro that can help prevent some number of those infections is an important product. So there's still an important need in the marketplace. This innovative delivery device enables us to meet a large portion of that need. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc. Derek, let's go with the next question. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Geoffrey, you may begin your question. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC Thanks very much and thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on the question about erenumab, Bob, could you take us through your thinking about the partnering decision? Because you're in a strong net cash position. You've got robust cash flow. You've got plenty of space in your R&D given the sequential trend, and yet you partner one of your two late-stage products for what certainly looks like it's a fairly specialized prescriber base initially. So could you talk a little bit about that, and then also how you'll be collaborating with Novartis on the launch? Particularly, who will be setting price and how you're thinking about price? Thanks. Sorry for the complicated question. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. No, that's fine, Geoff. We'll take it in two parts. Why don't I take the first piece? Then we'll have Tony address some of the specifics in your question. We recognize and we're excited about the opportunity to have a first-in-class and a molecule that we think has a good chance to be best-in-class for a disease where there just aren't good therapies available today, so we're excited about that. But at the same time, Geoff, I think there is a specialty element of this that we don't have experience in. Novartis has been in the neurology neuroscience field for some 60 odd years now, and so they have a real established track record there. And as we interacted with them first with respect to the international markets, I think we came to realize there were opportunities to create a bigger opportunity by combining forces than by going it alone in the international markets. We've come to know and share and respect each other's capabilities over the time since that agreement went into place. And as we looked at the opportunity in the U.S. and our desire to make sure we resource this to win, including getting off to a strong start with the specialist prescribers, it was our view that our shareholders were going to be better served by our joining up with somebody that had a very established presence in this field. So that's our view, and I think all of our interactions since then make us feel confident that that was the right decision for the shareholders. But, Tony, why don't you add your thoughts? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Sure, we've been working with Novartis now from a global research perspective and a global marketing perspective for some time. So the teams have gotten to know each other quite well. My counterpart and I have been drawn into these discussions with these experts, as I said, and he and I are becoming even more increasingly excited about the opportunity to deliver a first-in-class product like this to patients in need. He and I both have experience in terms of launching products in the U.S. over the last five years or so, and we understand some of the barriers and some of the challenges. But we also understand the large unmet need over here. It's clear to us that a strong start in terms of having a clear group of physicians who realize the importance of treating patients properly is going to be important to place pressure on the entire payer system to ensure we can get access. They have a very good presence in the neuroscience market. The feedback we've had from third-party research has shown their team and their medical team are very well regarded, and this strong relationship in our mind will support the ability to launch fast, launch rapidly, and be highly effective in the initial uptake. So they're a good team to be with. We will work closely with them, and I think we can maximize our ability to bring value to patients. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. And, Geoff, as regard to your questions about operational details, obviously those are topics that we discuss with them in detail before we move forward. And we think between the two of us, we think we've got those details worked out. But again, we're excited to have this partnership in hand and we look forward to getting this molecule approved so we can get out and help patients with it. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC Great, good luck. Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. Ian, you may begin your question. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you, just another question on Repatha. You made a comment that payers could potentially make some changes over the coming months. I was just hoping to clarify. Are those changes in prior authorization, or are they just payers being more diligent in making sure the right patients are getting access to the therapy? And as I think about ACC.8 (1:09:38), the guideline changes in some of the answers you provided, do you need those changes – do you need the new guidelines to state lower LDL goals, or what else, what other type of changes could we see which would benefit the PCSK9 class overall? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So, Ian, it's Tony again. So clearly, everything here is driven from the interpretation and understanding about outcomes data, that fundamentally this product, Repatha, on top of maximally tolerated statins, which is the gold standard to date, is able to drive LDL down further and reduce even more dramatically the risk of heart attack and stroke. So the discussions with the payers are consistently around the utilization management criteria to make sure that the burden is less onerous for physicians, that they and patients are able to get access to products quicker and faster. White papers or position papers from professional cardiology organizations are really essential to start paving the way to ensure we move towards the guidelines down the road. But they factor, the good clinical data is what's important. Payers have said to us from the beginning that yes, they see the drug lowers LDL, but they need to understand what that means. The outcomes data now shows you what that means, and all our discussions have been, if we are to renegotiate a contract, it is based around the payers' willingness to amend and make more simple the utilization management criteria. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer, you may begin your question. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two pipeline questions, if I may. On romosozumab, the upcoming ARCH trial, what percentage of patients were enrolled in Latin America? And secondly on CGRP, I noticed you have a TREADMILL CV safety trial that wrapped up earlier in the year. Any update and/or feedback from that, and was that a study that FDA asked you to do? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Okay, so with respect to ARCH, the percentage of patients in Latin America, I don't remember an exact number, but it is substantially less that it was in the FRAME study, but it is still meaningful. So I think it's about 30% roughly, whereas it was higher than that in FRAME. But I think it's important to recognize that it wasn't the part of the world that the drug was being administered that was the problem. It was the fact that the fracture rates in a placebo-controlled population where physicians were very hesitant to put high-risk individuals into the trial because of the placebo arm, that the fracture rate was so low that we really didn't have any opportunity to demonstrate a further lowering of the fracture rate. And we don't expect that phenomenon in FRAME because the patients that were enrolled were by definition, by protocol, much higher risk. They had to have had prevalent fracture already. They have had much lower T-scores and so on, because in this case, patients are either getting romosozumab followed by alendronate, or alendronate from the get-go with no placebo control. So I wouldn't focus so much around the question of Latin America, although that was where we saw the problem with the very low event rates. And then the other piece to keep in mind is that we do have an event-driven analysis for non-vertebral fracture in ARCH which we didn't have in FRAME. And that also, as you know, addresses this event number powering problem that you can run into, which is essentially the wall we hit in FRAME. With respect to CGRP, I think it's a very good question. One of the things that I learned from talking with people at the meetings in Boston is that the real question in most neurologists' mind right now about the CGRP class remains long-term safety and tolerability. They're very impressed with the efficacy data. They're very impressed with the tolerability and safety that have been observed to date in relatively short exposures in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 study. And so I think there are a number of things that we have been doing specifically as a company, like we have over three years of long-term exposure in open-label extension studies. Other companies, to our knowledge, have not been doing this. We did the CV TREADMILL study on our own volition because we felt that, again, these were going to be kind of questions that would exist in the marketplace. We have a number of pre-clinical and clinical studies, for example, on the impact on blood pressure and so on that would have been done specifically in anticipation of the kind of questions that prescribers will have around the long-term safety of the product. Many of these data are not broadly appreciated because they haven't come out in peer-reviewed publications and they haven't been necessarily presented in plenary type presentations like the Phase 3 data were. But in aggregate, I think these are going to be important and potentially differentiating data for the product. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC That's very helpful, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Carter, you may begin your question. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Sean, I'll stick with the pipeline theme. On the BLINCYTO studies, you referenced the ALL B-cell (1:15:25). When do you think those data might be presented? Could those be registrational? And on CNP520, is there an interim built into that Alzheimer's study? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, so the BLINCYTO studies are just enrolling now, so it's a little bit hard to project when we would be presenting data from them. That depends, of course, on a number of factors in terms of enrollment rate and when we might hit certain milestones with respect to interim analyses and so on. But the program is progressing on plan, and we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm in the marketplace in the clinical trial investigator space, I should say, for the program. And then with respect to the CNP520 program, there are some futility analyses built into the Alzheimer's study, which are designed to cut losses if we weren't seeing some kind of an effect. And I believe there may be also an early stopping efficacy interim late in the trial, though. I'd have to go back and look at the protocol to be sure about that. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Sean, not everybody might be familiar with CNP520. So you just might remind them (1:16:56) Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, so you might remember that this was highlighted in The Wall Street Journal the other day. Novartis and Amgen I think had come convergently to the opinion that we have extremely high confidence in the target itself, in large part because of the genetic validation work that was done on this target at deCODE. And so the question is really a question of when to intervene. And what we're doing in this study is enriching for a population, who based on their APOE genotype and age are very highly predisposed to converting from a normal cognitive capability to a minimally impaired cognitive capability. So we're going earlier than anyone else has done to date. This actually may be what's required to demonstrate a disease modifying effect. So the molecule itself is a very high-quality small molecule BACE inhibitor that has been demonstrated to drop A-beta levels dramatically in CSF and all that good stuff. And the main issue strategically is to go in a little bit earlier in this population. And while this is a genetically defined population, about 60% of patients who actually develop Alzheimer's have one of these predisposing alleles. So it's not some tiny little population. It's genetically defined. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff, you may begin your question. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question, one for Tony or Sean. So in contrast to Repatha, you haven't had a lot of payer pushback on Prolia. So are there payer or pricing lessons to be learned when you think about the romo [romosozumab] launch in July and its combination with Prolia? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Let me take that one, Geoff. The major difference probably between the two is that the majority of Prolia sales are Part B, so it's a buy in bulk model, where Repatha is predominantly a Part D or a retail product we sell. I think it's all around the value proposition, and we go back again to the day we presented at the ACC just to reconfirm that the present net price of Repatha in the marketplace is well within the range of the value proposition or the value-based pricing in fact for this particular product. So I think the two things are different. There was a lot of speculation up front about how the PCSK9s could cost the market $150 billion or whatever it was, which resulted in some silly actions, I think, with all due respect. The drugs continue to show real good BAT value. We're happy to stand up and discuss it anywhere. And how the bank (1:19:54) would pay at the moment is how do you change the utilization management criteria, nothing else. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Raymond James. Chris, you may begin your question. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey, thanks. So just a broader question on the biologics market structure and maybe as it relates to your biosimilar business. So we were reading a white paper that I think you guys put out recently on the biosimilar market. I think you guys highlight a real problem. Even under a hypothetical scenario, I think your paper talked about how where a biosimilar is priced at, say, a 25% discount to the innovator, you still have a patient copay that's still higher than the innovative drug. I think in your paper it said almost 40% higher under Medicare Part D. So just curious, you guys seem as close as anyone to policy makers and directions to where this may go, and I know you devoted a great deal of time and energy towards your biosimilar business. I assume that there's an expectation here that some of these disincentives will go away. Can you maybe talk in broad terms how you think that might play out? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Tony, why don't you go ahead and take that? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Sure. One, I don't remember us putting out a white paper, so I just want to make sure that we're not being given authorship of something we didn't write because I'm unaware of Amgen putting out a white paper. We have said historically in the past that we believe that the biosimilar market will move much like a branded generic market; that the pricing in the beginning will be cautious; that the people who come to market and those who actually use biosimilars will be looking for a combination of quality, continuity of quality, continuity of supply, and the reputations of the organizations coming to market. We believe that at Amgen we have a lot of good reputation. We have a 38-year history of never shorting a patient, of having quality product consistently on the marketplace. As we've gone through the process of actually developing these biosimilars ourselves, we've realized how tough it is to actually bring these drugs to market or how to develop them. We've spent time with regulators around the world making sure they understand what good looks like, that the rules and regulations are aligned with what we are doing. There is some debate in the U.S. around linked J-codes between the brand versus the biosimilar. I think those are still being debated at the moment. But until then, it's an unlinked J-code, which means the reimbursement or copays are different. There's a lot happening in the marketplace, and how that could change, I can't speculate now. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc. Derek, as it's going on 6:30 on the East Coast, let's take two last questions. Operator Okay, absolutely. And your next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies. Eun, you may begin your question. Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC Thanks, a question for Sean. In your collaboration with Arrowhead on RNAi therapies targeting cardiovascular diseases, what's your view on potential safety issues that may be related to RNAi-based therapies? And when do you expect to move into clinic? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, I think that the siRNA technologies right now look good enough that in the case where the only way one can drug a target appears to be siRNA-based inhibition, it's a reasonable thing to pursue. And so that's what we're doing, for example, for LPa where we don't feel there's any other way to drug the target. It's not a derisked platform at this point, and there obviously are concerns. And I think that regulators are going to be very cautious in approving products early on that are based on this kind of novel platform, unless of course it's in a setting where there's very high unmet need and no other kind of options. So we are exploring siRNA largely in settings in which the drug can't be – the target can't be interdicted in other ways, and also where we feel that the therapy would be unique in its ability to address that target. So LPa represents an example like that. We have other targets that we feel are potentially that way. And so at this point, we're moving that ahead. The program is really still in a preclinical stage, but it is moving very rapidly. The collaboration has been great. But I can't really give specific timelines of when it would be in the clinic at this point. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc. Let's take one last question, and then Bob will make a few closing comments. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Salim Syed. Salim, you may begin your question. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Great. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in, just a question on romo maybe for Sean or for Tony. The non-vertebral data, guys, how are you thinking about that in terms of uptake? And then also will we be getting that non-vertebral data in the press release, either in a qualitative form or quantitative form, when we get the top line? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes. So what I would say is that having evidence of non-vertebral fracture impact is important for cytotherapeutics (1:25:56). Of course, the most important endpoint for physicians, payers, and patients is clinical fracture, which is the symptomatic vertebral fractures which can be very profoundly impactful to patients' quality of life, as well as the long-bone fractures or non-vertebral fractures. And there, we've seen good results, and that's one of the co-primary endpoints for ARCH as well. And I think that it is something that is an important variable. In the end, things like hip fracture are the real dreaded complications of osteoporosis. So having a sense from the aggregate data for a molecule that there can be protection in sites like the hip is important, and that's why we're anticipating ARCH keenly, as it's coming very soon. I can't comment on what we exactly we'll decide to disclose in a press release. We are always focused on very complex embargo requirements by both the society clinical presentation venues as well as the journals that we're trying to publish in, and this can be quite an elaborate dance to figure out what we can put into our press releases in that setting. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Got it, thanks so much. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. All right, thank you all for your questions and for your time. We appreciate it. Maybe just a quick couple of quick thoughts from me and then we'll let you back to work. First, as you heard in our discussion, we're pleased with the volume growth, particularly from our newer products in the quarter. Clearly, there was some noise in the first quarter around Enbrel and the trends. But as you heard us say, we think the long-term trends for Enbrel are on track despite that noise in the marketplace in the first quarter. And again, lastly, we think we've positioned the company well. And as a group here, we're excited about the future given the long-term growth opportunities that we see for Amgen. So thanks for your interest. We'll look forward to talking to you on the second quarter call. Operator This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Hi, thanks for taking the question, maybe just a two-part on Repatha. First, Tony, can you comment if the payers appreciate the details of the four-year data that Sean walked through? And then it looks like net price might have taken a step down in the U.S. in the first quarter. I'm just wondering if you can confirm that and any additional commentary that you can provide. Thank you. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Terence, sure. All our discussions with the payers have been really starting with the discussion on the Repatha outcomes data, and I don't think we've had any pushback at all in terms of people really understanding the robust value. We will continue to work with them. Obviously, each one of them has agreed to go back and relook at the utilization management criteria as we speak. There does appear to be a slight adjustment in the net price. One was due to a small accounting adjustment. And two, of course, we book our patient copay program to the net price, and the first quarter is normally a lot higher than second, third, or fourth. So we see that normalizing as we go forward. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Can we go to the next question? Operator And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew, you may begin your question. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great, thanks for taking the question. Tony, thanks for the detail on Enbrel. I'm sure, as you appreciate, there's a lot of questions that people have on that. If I can just ask two points there, you cited a market slowdown which you think will improve throughout the rest of the year. Could you just talk about your confidence around that? And beyond some of the weekly data points, are there other reasons to believe that broadly the market is not slowing? And then second, it seems to me that the impact on price in the first quarter is higher than you've seen in quarters past, even when thinking about copay assistance and some of the other factors. Is there anything else going on there, and what's your confidence about price leveling out for the year? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Thanks, Matt. So as you know, with Enbrel as a retail product, about 97% of the volume is reported on a script basis, so we can track it quite tightly. For the quarter, it was definitely down, both rheumatology and dermatology. When I look at it sequentially, January, February, March, and then as I see it going into April, each one of those months has shown an incremental growth both in terms of DOT as well as prescriptions and in terms of growth. So January was down a lot. February was better than January. March was better than February, and April is starting to look much better than March as well. From a net price, we don't see a dramatic change in the net price. Some the new contracts are coming into place, but our outlook on net price for 2017 hasn't changed at all. And when I look at abandonment rates, abandonment rates in the first quarter are pretty similar for Enbrel to what they were in the fourth quarter or the third quarter last year. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. And, Matthew, maybe just big picture here, when we look at the flow of patients into the information space, particularly rheumatology and dermatology, we see no reason in the marketplace that the trend of an increasing number of patients into this therapy would have abruptly changed between the fourth and the first quarter. So we think that we'll continue to see growth in the underlying demand for these kind of products. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying, you may begin your question. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on Repatha. How much have you heard from the physicians in terms of feedback that they have to wait for a treatment guideline change by, let's say, ACC or AHA before they start prescribing more Repatha? And if that's the case, when do you think those professional organizations will change the guideline? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I think it's probably a subtle question that you're asking there, Ying, so why don't we just take a moment and really step through it. Tony, why don't you go ahead and take the first go. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So all our discussions with cardiologists have been around their frustration of the administrative burden that has been placed upon them to get a prescription for appropriate patients. A lot of them are having to hire full-time nurses to spend the entire day chasing down required patient data, to chase down interactions between the patient or between the physician and the respective payer or the PBM. The guidelines themselves clearly in everyone's mind would help move the decision-making and the utilization criteria a bit quicker. But our major conversation with physicians is not really around the guidelines; it's more around the inconvenience. From a guideline perspective, clearly both the AHA and the ACC are busy looking at the outcomes data. They've told us they're busy identifying position papers they wish to put forward. The NLA, the National Lipid Association, was there. The Association of Preventive Cardiology (sic) [American Society of Preventive Cardiology] (54:25), run by Dr. Seth Baum, is in the process of looking at a revised set of guidelines, including a proposed set of utilization management criteria, which they're proposing the PBMs and the payers should be using. In terms of guidelines themselves, both the AHA and the ACC have said it will take some time before they actually get to a final guideline change. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I think the important information here is that the data demonstrated that lower is better, or as Sean said and as we increasingly hear from experts in the field, lowest is best. And I think people recognize that the current guidelines are out of sync with that. So the data make the point clear, and we expect to see white papers and then ultimately changes in the guidelines. But for right now, the data are an important piece of getting people to understand how to manage this disease for patients. Let's go to the next question. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen. Eric, you may begin your question. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC Thanks. Just as a follow-on to Ying's question, it sounds like the major bottleneck is this hassle factor, Tony, that physicians are being put through, and I guess I'm just wondering what kind of leverage Amgen has to reduce that factor. Can't payers just stay entrenched and say our policies are that we'll cover it, but we're going to make you go through X, Y, and Z hoops and maintain the hassle factor and I guess the evidence of better medicine? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So, Eric, I don't think I've spoken to a single cardiologist or general practitioner who hasn't commented on how onerous the process is to gain access to these products. I think without a doubt, the third-party organizations, the professional organizations such as the ACC, the AHA, as well as patient organizations such as the FH Foundation are the ones who are running the research work at the moment, including Duke, as I said. We actually looked at those patients who received a PCSK9 and those who didn't, and actually show there's no clinical difference in the patients themselves. This type of burden I think is going to start putting the pressure on the payers. Talking to the payers, they themselves are agreeing with us that the clinical data is important, and they need to expand access to appropriate patients. So we will continue to drive that interaction with them. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory, you may begin your question. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon. I have a pretty commercial question on erenumab. I wonder if you can comment on early interactions you're having with payers on that front or maybe just general market research for the product. I guess specifically, I'm wondering how much of an impediment you expect access to be in the early days of that pending launch and how much your research may have factored into the strategic decision to further engage with Novartis. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So let me start, Cory, by just telling you about an interaction I had with my counterpart at Novartis yesterday. He and I have both been in recent contact with neurologists who specialize in treating patients with chronic migraine. And the two of us are quite elated at the level of excitement we're seeing amongst these physicians about having for the first time in decades a treatment opportunity to really help people who have this debilitating disease. It truly is one of those symptomatic diseases where if you've got a migraine, you really know about it, and it impacts how you run your life. Can you run your life or can you be a good caregiver? We are starting our discussions with the payers right now. We are helping them see the data from a clinical perspective. Obviously, the real negotiation can only start once we have the label, and we look forward to having that in the next couple months or so. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Josh, you may begin your question. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thanks for taking the question. If you can, help us understand the market segmentation in asthma, really the issue with AMG 157 again versus some of the other novel biologics targeting the IL4 side pathways (58:46). Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Okay. The question was a little bit hard to hear, Josh, but I think, Sean, why don't you take the first crack at it? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, what I would say is that it's still early days for a lot of the therapies that are still in development. But as you look across the biologics landscape in asthma, there's a few things that are clear. One is that in aggregate, asthma is an enormous opportunity from the perspective of the unmet need and the number of patients who are, for example, having to take courses of oral corticosteroids throughout the course of the year to manage their disease, which is very problematic for them. And I think what you're seeing is that many of the mechanisms that are either out there now in biologics or being developed currently are segmented to populations that, for example, have high eosinophilic counts, atopic phenotype, et cetera. And in the case of TSLP, what we like about TSLP is it is a very upstream kind of a mediator of this inflammation. And our expectation is that we could have a very broad impact on patients with activity across the spectrum of patient phenotypes within the asthma disease spectrum, which would make it a very attractive therapeutic option. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny, you may begin your question. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Good evening and thank you for taking my question. I guess the Supreme Court have been looking at the biosimilar law today. In the case they side with you and find that shall means will, can you give us a feel for what will happen with the biosimilars that have already launched for Neulasta? Will they have to come back into the full patent dance? Essentially, if you win this case, what does it mean in terms of delay of biosimilar Neulasta approvals or launches? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I think there are a couple things in your question there, Ronny. Let me tease apart the two pieces of it. First, as you know, the Supreme Court reviewed this today, and so we'll know within a matter of weeks. Obviously, we think the 180-day needs to be enforced as it was written in the law. But with respect – I think you must have been referring to the short-acting competitors to NEUPOGEN. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC No, I was talking about the patent dance and impact of Neulasta biosimilar launches. Essentially, if you win that, will the biosimilar Neulasta be delayed? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I guess I'm not sure what you mean by delayed. I think again, the big picture here, Ronny, is that we've known for some time that we'll face biosimilar competition. We're expecting that that will happen for Neulasta, and we're ready for that. You've seen the actions that we've been taking over the past couple years to be ready for that. And we're ready to embrace the competition, and we've positioned the company from an operating expense standpoint with the knowledge that that competition is coming, and we're launching medicines and entering markets that we think will help us grow beyond that. So the 180-day is obviously post-FDA approval, so we're watching different competitive products make their way through the regulatory pathway. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc. If I could then, in terms of the guidance we've offered, there are none that have been approved yet to compete with Neulasta. There's one that's lined up I think in the third quarter here. So if it were approved and the 180-day stands, then that would imply, as we've indicated, that we could face competition as soon as late this year, and that's how our guidance is built right now. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Yes. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Alethia, you may begin your question. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just again on Neulasta, I know Onpro is picking up momentum. But I'm just trying to figure out if you think – how do you think this helps defend you against biosimilar share? Is it as simple as that the market is remodeling itself, and so it delays and prolongs some of the competition that you may see, or is there some other dynamic we should be aware of? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Alethia, it's Tony. So let me go back to a comment I made on the last quarter earnings. Let's use MD Anderson as an example of probably one of the premier large oncology teaching centers in the country. It took MD Anderson almost – just over 12 months to go through their P&T committee to get an agreement within the institution to start shifting patients to Onpro. And the rationale was they were really having a good look at the clinical value, the treatment protocols, the discharge protocols, and they finally agreed that this product was certainly worthwhile having. We spent a number of weeks training their 600 oncology nurses so they were able to really identify the right patient, administer the drug before patients went home, and they have therefore changed the clinical practice. The feedback we get from both the oncology nurses, the oncologists themselves, and patients in fact about the fact they no longer have to come back 24 hours later or a day after their chemotherapy when they're in the middle of chemo-induced nausea and vomiting is a huge advantage and allows them a better quality of life. So we really believe that the benefit this drug brings is not simply a device. It is really something that allows patients to continue to live their lives whilst being treated for cancer. It also has resulted in changes, definitive changes in discharge protocols, which we think will take some time to be reversed if there's no other alternative. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Yes, it's worth keeping in mind the big picture here, Alethia. There's some data in a peer review publication from this week recognizing that there are 100,000 hospitalizations a year in this country from patients who suffer from an infection while undergoing chemotherapy, and of course that's what NEUPOGEN and Neulasta are designed to address. And any product like Onpro that can help prevent some number of those infections is an important product. So there's still an important need in the marketplace. This innovative delivery device enables us to meet a large portion of that need. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc. Derek, let's go with the next question. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Geoffrey, you may begin your question. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC Thanks very much and thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on the question about erenumab, Bob, could you take us through your thinking about the partnering decision? Because you're in a strong net cash position. You've got robust cash flow. You've got plenty of space in your R&D given the sequential trend, and yet you partner one of your two late-stage products for what certainly looks like it's a fairly specialized prescriber base initially. So could you talk a little bit about that, and then also how you'll be collaborating with Novartis on the launch? Particularly, who will be setting price and how you're thinking about price? Thanks. Sorry for the complicated question. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. No, that's fine, Geoff. We'll take it in two parts. Why don't I take the first piece? Then we'll have Tony address some of the specifics in your question. We recognize and we're excited about the opportunity to have a first-in-class and a molecule that we think has a good chance to be best-in-class for a disease where there just aren't good therapies available today, so we're excited about that. But at the same time, Geoff, I think there is a specialty element of this that we don't have experience in. Novartis has been in the neurology neuroscience field for some 60 odd years now, and so they have a real established track record there. And as we interacted with them first with respect to the international markets, I think we came to realize there were opportunities to create a bigger opportunity by combining forces than by going it alone in the international markets. We've come to know and share and respect each other's capabilities over the time since that agreement went into place. And as we looked at the opportunity in the U.S. and our desire to make sure we resource this to win, including getting off to a strong start with the specialist prescribers, it was our view that our shareholders were going to be better served by our joining up with somebody that had a very established presence in this field. So that's our view, and I think all of our interactions since then make us feel confident that that was the right decision for the shareholders. But, Tony, why don't you add your thoughts? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Sure, we've been working with Novartis now from a global research perspective and a global marketing perspective for some time. So the teams have gotten to know each other quite well. My counterpart and I have been drawn into these discussions with these experts, as I said, and he and I are becoming even more increasingly excited about the opportunity to deliver a first-in-class product like this to patients in need. He and I both have experience in terms of launching products in the U.S. over the last five years or so, and we understand some of the barriers and some of the challenges. But we also understand the large unmet need over here. It's clear to us that a strong start in terms of having a clear group of physicians who realize the importance of treating patients properly is going to be important to place pressure on the entire payer system to ensure we can get access. They have a very good presence in the neuroscience market. The feedback we've had from third-party research has shown their team and their medical team are very well regarded, and this strong relationship in our mind will support the ability to launch fast, launch rapidly, and be highly effective in the initial uptake. So they're a good team to be with. We will work closely with them, and I think we can maximize our ability to bring value to patients. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. And, Geoff, as regard to your questions about operational details, obviously those are topics that we discuss with them in detail before we move forward. And we think between the two of us, we think we've got those details worked out. But again, we're excited to have this partnership in hand and we look forward to getting this molecule approved so we can get out and help patients with it. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC Great, good luck. Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. Ian, you may begin your question. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you, just another question on Repatha. You made a comment that payers could potentially make some changes over the coming months. I was just hoping to clarify. Are those changes in prior authorization, or are they just payers being more diligent in making sure the right patients are getting access to the therapy? And as I think about ACC.8 (1:09:38), the guideline changes in some of the answers you provided, do you need those changes – do you need the new guidelines to state lower LDL goals, or what else, what other type of changes could we see which would benefit the PCSK9 class overall? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So, Ian, it's Tony again. So clearly, everything here is driven from the interpretation and understanding about outcomes data, that fundamentally this product, Repatha, on top of maximally tolerated statins, which is the gold standard to date, is able to drive LDL down further and reduce even more dramatically the risk of heart attack and stroke. So the discussions with the payers are consistently around the utilization management criteria to make sure that the burden is less onerous for physicians, that they and patients are able to get access to products quicker and faster. White papers or position papers from professional cardiology organizations are really essential to start paving the way to ensure we move towards the guidelines down the road. But they factor, the good clinical data is what's important. Payers have said to us from the beginning that yes, they see the drug lowers LDL, but they need to understand what that means. The outcomes data now shows you what that means, and all our discussions have been, if we are to renegotiate a contract, it is based around the payers' willingness to amend and make more simple the utilization management criteria. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer, you may begin your question. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two pipeline questions, if I may. On romosozumab, the upcoming ARCH trial, what percentage of patients were enrolled in Latin America? And secondly on CGRP, I noticed you have a TREADMILL CV safety trial that wrapped up earlier in the year. Any update and/or feedback from that, and was that a study that FDA asked you to do? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Okay, so with respect to ARCH, the percentage of patients in Latin America, I don't remember an exact number, but it is substantially less that it was in the FRAME study, but it is still meaningful. So I think it's about 30% roughly, whereas it was higher than that in FRAME. But I think it's important to recognize that it wasn't the part of the world that the drug was being administered that was the problem. It was the fact that the fracture rates in a placebo-controlled population where physicians were very hesitant to put high-risk individuals into the trial because of the placebo arm, that the fracture rate was so low that we really didn't have any opportunity to demonstrate a further lowering of the fracture rate. And we don't expect that phenomenon in FRAME because the patients that were enrolled were by definition, by protocol, much higher risk. They had to have had prevalent fracture already. They have had much lower T-scores and so on, because in this case, patients are either getting romosozumab followed by alendronate, or alendronate from the get-go with no placebo control. So I wouldn't focus so much around the question of Latin America, although that was where we saw the problem with the very low event rates. And then the other piece to keep in mind is that we do have an event-driven analysis for non-vertebral fracture in ARCH which we didn't have in FRAME. And that also, as you know, addresses this event number powering problem that you can run into, which is essentially the wall we hit in FRAME. With respect to CGRP, I think it's a very good question. One of the things that I learned from talking with people at the meetings in Boston is that the real question in most neurologists' mind right now about the CGRP class remains long-term safety and tolerability. They're very impressed with the efficacy data. They're very impressed with the tolerability and safety that have been observed to date in relatively short exposures in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 study. And so I think there are a number of things that we have been doing specifically as a company, like we have over three years of long-term exposure in open-label extension studies. Other companies, to our knowledge, have not been doing this. We did the CV TREADMILL study on our own volition because we felt that, again, these were going to be kind of questions that would exist in the marketplace. We have a number of pre-clinical and clinical studies, for example, on the impact on blood pressure and so on that would have been done specifically in anticipation of the kind of questions that prescribers will have around the long-term safety of the product. Many of these data are not broadly appreciated because they haven't come out in peer-reviewed publications and they haven't been necessarily presented in plenary type presentations like the Phase 3 data were. But in aggregate, I think these are going to be important and potentially differentiating data for the product. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC That's very helpful, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Carter, you may begin your question. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Sean, I'll stick with the pipeline theme. On the BLINCYTO studies, you referenced the ALL B-cell (1:15:25). When do you think those data might be presented? Could those be registrational? And on CNP520, is there an interim built into that Alzheimer's study? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, so the BLINCYTO studies are just enrolling now, so it's a little bit hard to project when we would be presenting data from them. That depends, of course, on a number of factors in terms of enrollment rate and when we might hit certain milestones with respect to interim analyses and so on. But the program is progressing on plan, and we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm in the marketplace in the clinical trial investigator space, I should say, for the program. And then with respect to the CNP520 program, there are some futility analyses built into the Alzheimer's study, which are designed to cut losses if we weren't seeing some kind of an effect. And I believe there may be also an early stopping efficacy interim late in the trial, though. I'd have to go back and look at the protocol to be sure about that. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Sean, not everybody might be familiar with CNP520. So you just might remind them (1:16:56) Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, so you might remember that this was highlighted in The Wall Street Journal the other day. Novartis and Amgen I think had come convergently to the opinion that we have extremely high confidence in the target itself, in large part because of the genetic validation work that was done on this target at deCODE. And so the question is really a question of when to intervene. And what we're doing in this study is enriching for a population, who based on their APOE genotype and age are very highly predisposed to converting from a normal cognitive capability to a minimally impaired cognitive capability. So we're going earlier than anyone else has done to date. This actually may be what's required to demonstrate a disease modifying effect. So the molecule itself is a very high-quality small molecule BACE inhibitor that has been demonstrated to drop A-beta levels dramatically in CSF and all that good stuff. And the main issue strategically is to go in a little bit earlier in this population. And while this is a genetically defined population, about 60% of patients who actually develop Alzheimer's have one of these predisposing alleles. So it's not some tiny little population. It's genetically defined. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff, you may begin your question. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question, one for Tony or Sean. So in contrast to Repatha, you haven't had a lot of payer pushback on Prolia. So are there payer or pricing lessons to be learned when you think about the romo [romosozumab] launch in July and its combination with Prolia? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Let me take that one, Geoff. The major difference probably between the two is that the majority of Prolia sales are Part B, so it's a buy in bulk model, where Repatha is predominantly a Part D or a retail product we sell. I think it's all around the value proposition, and we go back again to the day we presented at the ACC just to reconfirm that the present net price of Repatha in the marketplace is well within the range of the value proposition or the value-based pricing in fact for this particular product. So I think the two things are different. There was a lot of speculation up front about how the PCSK9s could cost the market $150 billion or whatever it was, which resulted in some silly actions, I think, with all due respect. The drugs continue to show real good BAT value. We're happy to stand up and discuss it anywhere. And how the bank (1:19:54) would pay at the moment is how do you change the utilization management criteria, nothing else. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Raymond James. Chris, you may begin your question. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey, thanks. So just a broader question on the biologics market structure and maybe as it relates to your biosimilar business. So we were reading a white paper that I think you guys put out recently on the biosimilar market. I think you guys highlight a real problem. Even under a hypothetical scenario, I think your paper talked about how where a biosimilar is priced at, say, a 25% discount to the innovator, you still have a patient copay that's still higher than the innovative drug. I think in your paper it said almost 40% higher under Medicare Part D. So just curious, you guys seem as close as anyone to policy makers and directions to where this may go, and I know you devoted a great deal of time and energy towards your biosimilar business. I assume that there's an expectation here that some of these disincentives will go away. Can you maybe talk in broad terms how you think that might play out? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Tony, why don't you go ahead and take that? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Sure. One, I don't remember us putting out a white paper, so I just want to make sure that we're not being given authorship of something we didn't write because I'm unaware of Amgen putting out a white paper. We have said historically in the past that we believe that the biosimilar market will move much like a branded generic market; that the pricing in the beginning will be cautious; that the people who come to market and those who actually use biosimilars will be looking for a combination of quality, continuity of quality, continuity of supply, and the reputations of the organizations coming to market. We believe that at Amgen we have a lot of good reputation. We have a 38-year history of never shorting a patient, of having quality product consistently on the marketplace. As we've gone through the process of actually developing these biosimilars ourselves, we've realized how tough it is to actually bring these drugs to market or how to develop them. We've spent time with regulators around the world making sure they understand what good looks like, that the rules and regulations are aligned with what we are doing. There is some debate in the U.S. around linked J-codes between the brand versus the biosimilar. I think those are still being debated at the moment. But until then, it's an unlinked J-code, which means the reimbursement or copays are different. There's a lot happening in the marketplace, and how that could change, I can't speculate now. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc. Derek, as it's going on 6:30 on the East Coast, let's take two last questions. Operator Okay, absolutely. And your next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies. Eun, you may begin your question. Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC Thanks, a question for Sean. In your collaboration with Arrowhead on RNAi therapies targeting cardiovascular diseases, what's your view on potential safety issues that may be related to RNAi-based therapies? And when do you expect to move into clinic? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, I think that the siRNA technologies right now look good enough that in the case where the only way one can drug a target appears to be siRNA-based inhibition, it's a reasonable thing to pursue. And so that's what we're doing, for example, for LPa where we don't feel there's any other way to drug the target. It's not a derisked platform at this point, and there obviously are concerns. And I think that regulators are going to be very cautious in approving products early on that are based on this kind of novel platform, unless of course it's in a setting where there's very high unmet need and no other kind of options. So we are exploring siRNA largely in settings in which the drug can't be – the target can't be interdicted in other ways, and also where we feel that the therapy would be unique in its ability to address that target. So LPa represents an example like that. We have other targets that we feel are potentially that way. And so at this point, we're moving that ahead. The program is really still in a preclinical stage, but it is moving very rapidly. The collaboration has been great. But I can't really give specific timelines of when it would be in the clinic at this point. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc. Let's take one last question, and then Bob will make a few closing comments. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Salim Syed. Salim, you may begin your question. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Great. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in, just a question on romo maybe for Sean or for Tony. The non-vertebral data, guys, how are you thinking about that in terms of uptake? And then also will we be getting that non-vertebral data in the press release, either in a qualitative form or quantitative form, when we get the top line? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes. So what I would say is that having evidence of non-vertebral fracture impact is important for cytotherapeutics (1:25:56). Of course, the most important endpoint for physicians, payers, and patients is clinical fracture, which is the symptomatic vertebral fractures which can be very profoundly impactful to patients' quality of life, as well as the long-bone fractures or non-vertebral fractures. And there, we've seen good results, and that's one of the co-primary endpoints for ARCH as well. And I think that it is something that is an important variable. In the end, things like hip fracture are the real dreaded complications of osteoporosis. So having a sense from the aggregate data for a molecule that there can be protection in sites like the hip is important, and that's why we're anticipating ARCH keenly, as it's coming very soon. I can't comment on what we exactly we'll decide to disclose in a press release. We are always focused on very complex embargo requirements by both the society clinical presentation venues as well as the journals that we're trying to publish in, and this can be quite an elaborate dance to figure out what we can put into our press releases in that setting. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Got it, thanks so much. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. All right, thank you all for your questions and for your time. We appreciate it. Maybe just a quick couple of quick thoughts from me and then we'll let you back to work. First, as you heard in our discussion, we're pleased with the volume growth, particularly from our newer products in the quarter. Clearly, there was some noise in the first quarter around Enbrel and the trends. But as you heard us say, we think the long-term trends for Enbrel are on track despite that noise in the marketplace in the first quarter. And again, lastly, we think we've positioned the company well. And as a group here, we're excited about the future given the long-term growth opportunities that we see for Amgen. So thanks for your interest. We'll look forward to talking to you on the second quarter call. Operator This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson. Gary Dickerson Thanks, Mike. I'm very happy to report another record-breaking quarter for Applied Materials with the highest revenue and earnings in our history. We've now set earnings records for 4 quarters in a row and as I look across the company, I see tremendous momentum. Our markets are strong and getting stronger and we're sustainably growing faster than these markets by expanding our served opportunity and gaining share. In today's call, I will provide our perspective on the factors driving the industry and our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth within this environment. I will then describe the key inflections and investments within our markets before concluding with updates on our major businesses. Bob will then provide additional detail about our performance and outlook. Let me start with the big picture. This is an incredibly exciting period for the electronics industry, with a broader set of drivers and a wider spectrum of companies making very large investments to advance semiconductor and display technology. In the past, PCs were the dominant factor in semiconductor demand. PCs drove the technology road map and enterprise refresh cycles drove industry upturns and downturns. More recently, global adoption of smartphones, combined with social media, have created a much more pervasive consumer demand, expanding the market and making it substantially less cyclical. Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. The impact for Applied is twofold. First, our markets are growing and becoming more stable. Second, this is a period of incredible innovation in logic, memory and display and we're in a great position to provide the critical building blocks needed to move the industry forward. At Applied, our strategy is to be the innovation leader in markets that are evolving faster than ever before. To do that, we fueled innovation by reallocating resources and significantly increasing our investment in new product development. Then, to drive repeatable success and accelerate the pace of learning, we've developed a unique operating system, our product development engine and trained more than 10,000 employees how to use it. Across the organization, we're focused on delivering highly differentiated products and services that enable customers to build new devices and structures that were never possible before. I believe our innovation leadership is sustainable because of the breadth and depth of our capabilities. Our ability to combine unique competencies, technology and intellectual property accelerates our innovation process and sets us apart from competitors. Having provided this context, I'll now describe the major inflections and investments taking place within our markets. Sales of memory chips are at record levels, fueled by increasing content in smartphones to support better cameras and VR applications as well as the need for more and higher performance storage in data centers. Market fundamentals remain strong and as a result, we're seeing robust investment from our memory customers. We believe we will see double-digit growth in DRAM spending this year and we expect NAND investment to be even stronger. Our view of 2018 and beyond is also positive for a number of reasons. The explosion of data storage requirements created by IoT, big data, AI and streaming video has only just begun. Data generation from new categories, such as Industry 4.0 and autonomous vehicles, can potentially dwarf existing applications within a few years. As 3D NAND bit density increases and cost per bit falls, new segments of the storage market are opening up for solid-state drives. And at the same time, the bit density increase from generation to generation is slower for 3D than it was for planar NAND. To compensate, the industry needs more wafer starts and greenfield capacity. In foundry, we're also seeing an acceleration of investment, both at the leading edge and in trailing geometries. In 2017, we expect investment in new leading edge capacity to make up about 60% of total foundry spending. This is driven by demand for more sophisticated smartphone processors as well as customers positioning to win the major inflections in high-performance computing and data centers that are needed to start unlocking the potential of AI. Within foundry, logic and DRAM, I'm increasingly excited about our opportunities in patterning. As these customers move to smaller chip geometries, all the layers in the device scale. A limited number of layers will move to EUV, but significantly more will move to multi-patterning. This means our patterning opportunity will expand considerably over the coming years. Applied is making significant investments to enable the patterning road map. We've already increased our patterning revenues more than 60% in the past year and still have significant room to grow. Taking all these factors into consideration, we now believe that wafer fab equipment spending for the calendar year could be up about 15% relative to 2016 and our outlook for 2018 and beyond remains positive. Our expectations for the display market also continue to strengthen as a result of large inflections in both TV and mobile screen technology. Average TV sizes are expected to reach 44.5 inches in 2017, up 5 inches in the past 3 years. One of the key factors driving this growth is demand for large-format TVs, 60 inches and above. As customers optimize factories for these bigger screen sizes, they are investing in new Gen 10.5 capacity. In parallel, we see investment in mobile OLED getting stronger as confidence in the adoption rates of OLED technology increases. Recent forecasts indicate that 2/3 of new smartphones could have OLED displays by 2021 and screen manufacturers are accelerating their investment plans accordingly. My final comments about the market environment relate to China which is an important long term growth opportunity for Applied. We believe 2017 spending will be slightly higher than last year. And based on the projects we're tracking, we expect to see a significant and steady investment ramp in both semiconductor and display beginning in 2018. I'll now provide updates on the performance and priorities for our major business groups. Overall, Applied gained 2 points of wafer fab equipment share in 2016 and based on the strength of our product portfolio, I believe we'll add to those gains over the next several years. In our leadership businesses, such as PVD, epi, implant and thermal processing, where we have strong share and highly differentiated products, we're extending our advantage. The available market for our leadership products is also growing, specifically in PVD and CMP. In PVD, we expect our available market to expand by more than 30% in 2017 as foundry customers adopt new interconnect technology for lower power devices. And the CMP market grew 40% in 2016 and is on track to grow another 20% this year, primarily driven by increasing steps in 3D NAND. In our high-growth businesses, we're also outperforming our competitors in markets that are growing rapidly. In 2016, we gained about 5 points of share in conductor etch and 2 points in etch overall. This means that since 2012, we've won nearly 20 points of conductor share and 10 points of total etch share. These gains are driven by enabling technologies, like Sym3 and selective etch and new process steps. Our CVD business is also outpacing the market, gaining almost 6 points of market share in 2016. We have great momentum in these businesses and plenty of headroom to grow. Service represents a stable and growing revenue stream for the company. On a year-on-year basis, we've now grown service revenues for 14 consecutive quarters and our compound rate of growth has been around 10% over the past 4 years. Our expanding portfolio of service solutions plays an increasingly important role for customers, helping them compress ramp times, improving device performance and yield and optimize output and operating costs. Because of this, I'm confident that we can continue to grow service at a similar pace. Another exciting growth opportunity for Applied is display. Since 2012, we've grown display revenues around 20% per year and we have great momentum. This year, we're on track to book more than $2 billion of orders. Display technology and manufacturing is becoming increasingly complex and Applied is in a unique position to enable the road map. By leveraging our semiconductor experience and capabilities, we're delivering the innovative products our customers need to accelerate major technology transitions. Before I hand the call over to Bob, let me quickly summarize. Q2 was another record-breaking quarter and 2017 is shaping up to be an outstanding year for Applied. Our markets are becoming even more attractive. They are growing sustainably and becoming less volatile. And Applied is playing a larger and more valuable role advancing the innovation road map. We have focused our strategy and investments to ensure that Applied is the innovation leader that consistently delivers highly differentiated products and services. As a result, we're raising the ceiling for our performance and potential. We're setting new records, growing our available market and gaining market share. Now let me hand the call over to Bob. Robert Halliday Thanks, Gary. Before going into the details of the quarter, I'll touch on 3 things that are sustainably better for Applied, one, our markets; two, our improving position in those markets which is enabling stronger gross margin performance; and three, our profitability and free cash flow. First, our markets are more attractive. We believe wafer fab equipment spending will be higher and less volatile for the foreseeable future. Display equipment spending also looks higher and more attractive, for Applied Materials in particular, because we're greatly increasing our served addressable market. Many of you have added valuable insights as to why WFE has become larger and less volatile. I believe it boils down to three things, one, the semiconductor market is growing and becoming more diverse; two, equipment intensity is increasing; and three, capital investment is measured and rational. This better industry environment is sustainable. As Gary mentioned, the semiconductor industry we enable has also become larger, more diverse and more critical to big innovations in the global economy. Today, we're seeing the emergence of new silicon-rich devices needed to enable the Internet of Things, cloud data centers and artificial intelligence. Data is becoming more valuable and harnessing the value requires silicon. For Applied, this translates to higher demand for logic and memory capacity at both the leading edge and trailing geometries. I believe the industry has seen a new wave of sustainable growth with economic value creation that justifies the cost of investment. Next, Applied's position in the markets in sustainably stronger. The changes we've made since 2013 in strategy, capital allocation and business systems, like the product development engine, have given us our strongest product pipeline in many years. I've been invited to an industrials conference this month to explain how our products are enabling big changes in manufacturing that many people call Industry 4.0. Here is how I plan to summarize our contribution without going into all of the technology. Applied has a very strong overall business that can be separated into just 2 parts. First, we have our leadership semi equipment and services business which together generate nearly 60% of our revenue. Our leadership semi businesses drive technologies that are critical to making transistors for data processing and networking. We've maintained steady growth and high share positions averaging about 70% because we bring unique value to our customers. Our services business is similar in that it is highly enabling to our customers and characterized by steady, profitable growth. We're deeply engaged with our logic and foundry customers to enable their advanced road maps with this part of our business. When you think about the big new chips used for artificial intelligence, think of Applied Materials. Second, we have our high-growth businesses which include etch and deposition used in 3D NAND and multi-patterning, along with inspection and display. Our high-growth businesses now represent about 40% of our revenue. We've made outsized investments in new and disruptive products in these areas to capitalize on the inflections we identified in 2013. Our high-growth semi businesses have been growing 40% faster than their markets and Applied's unique display equipment business is growing even faster. Another way to measure Applied's stronger position in the markets is to consider the changes in our share by semiconductor device type. In 2012, our share in foundry was over 20%, but our share in logic, DRAM and NAND was under 15%. Today, we believe our share is at least 22% in all 4. In fact, we're the #1 equipment company by revenue in NAND, DRAM, logic and foundry. So regardless of the spending mix, applied is well positioned. A great measure of the strength of our products, the value they bring to our customers and our execution as a company is gross margin expansion. Since 2013, we have increased our gross margins in our semi, services and display segments across virtually every business unit. In 2017, I believe we will deliver company non-GAAP gross margin of about 46% which would be up by about 5 points versus 2012 and the company's best annual performance in a decade. Now I'll talk about how these changes are flowing through the income statement to enable stronger profitability and shareholder returns. Over the 2013 to 2016 period, we have grown the revenue line by 44%. When we compared 2017 to 2013, we can see revenue growth of 90%. This revenue growth demonstrates the compounding benefits of our share gains and new product penetrations across semi, services and display. For the year, we expect our top line growth, gross margin performance and disciplined R&D investment and spending to generate the highest non-GAAP operating margin of the past 17 years and free cash flow of 20% or more. The company has returned 100% of the free cash flow we generated over the past 5 years and stands committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. Next, I'll comment on our performance during Q2. As a reminder, we no longer report quarterly orders because we're focused on driving year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. Quarter-to quarter demand patterns can vary across our business. However, we have grown our revenue and non-GAAP EPS on a year-over-year basis in 14 of the past 15 quarters. In Q2, we grew company revenue by 45% year-over-year and increased non-GAAP gross margin by 3.6 points. Our non-GAAP operating expenses grew by only 14% over this period and we continue to invest 2/3 of OpEx in R&D to fuel our product development engine. We set new company records in profitability as we increased non-GAAP operating profit by 110% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share by 132% year-over-year. Now I'll compare our Q2 segment performance to the same period last year. We grew semiconductor systems revenue by 51% to $2.4 billion and non-GAAP operating margin by 9.7 points. We grew services revenue by 14% to a record $724 million and non-GAAP operating margin by 80 basis points. We more than doubled our display revenue to $391 million and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 4.9 points. Turning to the balance sheet. We grew cash from operations by 87% compared to the same period last year. We ended the quarter with $7.7 billion of cash and investments and nearly half was onshore. This increase includes proceeds from $2.2 billion in debt raised in March to increase onshore liquidity. Soon after the end of the quarter, we used approximately $200 million of the offering to redeem our October 2017 notes. We returned $390 million to shareholders in the quarter, paying $108 million in dividend and using $282 million to repurchase 7 million shares of stock at an average price of $38.15. Now I'll provide our third quarter guidance. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.75 billion. The midpoint would be up by 30% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, our semiconductor systems revenue should increase by about 41%. Services revenue should increase by about 13%. And display revenue should increase by about 27%. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately 46.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $665 million, plus or minus $10 million. Non-GAAP EPS should be in the range of $0.79 to $0.87, the midpoint of which would be up by 66% year-over-year. Finally, to help you with your models, we project revenue in Corporate and Other to be around $15 million. We expect non-GAAP interest and other expenses of about $42 million and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 10.2%. And in the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP OpEx to be around $675 million. The projected increase is primarily targeted at R&D for new opportunities we're pursuing in emerging inflections. To summarize, one, our markets are sustainably better than at any other time in the history of the company; two, our competitive position and execution is sustainably better, giving us a strong pipeline of new and disruptive products and gross margin expansion; three, this growth, combined with disciplined investment and spending, is generating higher free cash flow and we're committed to returning the excess to our shareholders. Now Mike, let's start the Q&A. Michael Sullivan Thanks, Bob. [Operator Instructions]. Let's please begin. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Christopher Muse I guess question around sustainability. You're guiding WFE $40-plus billion here for '17. And curious, what gives you the confidence to be so upbeat looking into '18 and beyond? And I guess as part of that, would love to hear your thoughts in terms of the contributions from areas like AI and public cloud investments versus, I guess, more traditional areas like smartphone and PCs in the past. Robert Halliday Sure. Let me see if I can try to give you context. I think context rather than point answer is useful, give you context over time and context over breadth. So if you look at context, we thought back at Analyst Day last September that 2016 WFE would be about $33.7 billion. And in fact, it ended up a little over $35 billion. We thought at Analyst Day last year, this year would be $34.5 billion. And in fact, it started with a 4 number this year and it looks very healthy. So it's trending up. So then you say, well, where is it trending up? It's kind of up across the board. Earlier in the year, we thought it was kind of 5% up across the board. Now we think the whole thing is up 15%. We're seeing in DRAM, NAND, foundry. Tactically, we're seeing high utilization in all the fabs. We see no diminution of ordering patterns. We don't see double bookings or anything people might fear. So we see -- when you see strength across virtually every customer and virtually every device type, that goes to some root cause questions. So in my opinion, we're facing what we've been talking about for a while which is, there is more root cause demand drivers for devices. Now longer term, those root drive cause factors are going to be things like cars and AR/VR. What we're seeing now is tactically more content in the phones. We see a lot more content in the phones around NAND, DRAM and we also see strength within the processor side on both the cutting edge and the lagging edge. Lagging edge, again, this year, will be over 40% of device types. But the cutting edge is pretty strong, too. So we're seeing broadscale demand. My belief is that in the intermediate term, there's more content going in phones and more going into the big data centers which are both driving this which will help us. So then the question is, why is there more going in? We believe that there's, what I call broadly speaking, more applications for processor technology, more apps on top of it that are driving systemic demand. And I think, frankly, we're in the early innings of it. So if you ask me, okay, is the second half good? Yes, we're okay. If you ask me, is '18 good? Yes, I think it probably starts with a 4 again. It's pretty good. If you ask me long term which is what I spend a lot of time on, I see more root cause drivers for growth in semiconductor and silicon growth than I've seen in years and I think it's sustainable. Gary Dickerson And C.J., this is Gary. If you look out over time what drove our business in the past were the enterprise and PC upgrade cycles, then it moved to mobile, social media, very pervasive and driven by holiday season new products, where all of the consumer electronics companies had to have those products ready for Christmas or Chinese New Year. And as you go forward, we talked about AI and the importance of capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data is really going to disrupt big industries, transportation, health care, entertainment, manufacturing. And when you look at AI chips, almost every week, somebody's announcing a new AI chip, that it's at the -- logic devices that are at the physical limits of how big they can build those chips because there's so much value in these changes that are happening in these major industries. And of course, that's great for us. If you're building these big logic chips, you need better transistors, you need much better interconnect technology and you also need more memory which is materials-enabled and another area that's in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. So longer term, these inflections really create even more sustainability in terms of our markets going forward. Operator Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Harlan Sur On the China domestic semiconductor market and the outlook there, especially as we think about looking into 2018, I think conservatively, we're tracking 3 to 4 domestic foundry programs and about 4 to 5 memory programs. Foundry, obviously, is a bit more mature. Memory, we're kind of early innings, like Phase 1 kind of development. But especially on sort of memory in China and we get this question a lot from investors which is, is the team starting to get pipeline visibility into some of these programs actually starting to fire the confidence level that these programs are going to contribute to potentially a growth outlook for 2018? Love to get your views here. Gary Dickerson Yes, thanks for the question. China's one of our strongest regions for both semiconductor and display, very deep customer relationships. And what we're looking at for 2017, if we compare to '15, it's about 2x growth in our semiconductor business, 50% growth in service, 50% in display. And the business is really driven by a couple of different strategic factors. One is, there's a big gap between supply and demand and there's this large drive to try to close that gap and then also building a secure supply chain. When we look into 2018, what we're seeing right now is that the overall wafer fab equipment spending could be meaningfully up, more than $1 billion, maybe $1.5 billion from '17 to '18 and the domestic part of that increase is also up a meaningful amount in 2018. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything else? Robert Halliday Yes, I think that's pretty accurate. And if you ask us to look longer term, we see the domestic -- we see the total going up basically every year and the domestic part, in particular, going up every year. Operator Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company. Timothy Arcuri Bob, I actually have 2 questions. Number one, just on the recent debt raise. I know you paid down $200 million of debt with that money. But I'm surprised that there's not kind of a new capital return that was announced with that. So I guess that's my first question. And then I wanted to also ask about SSG in the back half of the year because if I run the numbers on calendar first half of the year, you're sort of annualizing to like $42 billion WFE roughly. And if we're going to be at $40 billion for the year, then that would sort of say that the back half has to be down like roughly 10%. So I'm wondering if that math's right. Robert Halliday Yes, 2 complicated questions. The first one, we raised money frankly from an opportunistic point of view and frankly a shareholder perspective. So if you look it, we raised $2.2 billion, now we had to repay $2 billion -- $200 million, so it's about $2 billion net. And it was about 50% of it was 10-year money, about 50% was 30-year money. And the 10% money, maybe like 3.3% and 4.3%, okay? So the average rate is about 3.8%. So basically what we're bringing into our capital structure is long term debt at low rates that's pseudo-equity at low cost of capital. So that's pretty attractive. The second thing we're doing, many people believe that there'll be some type of tax policy change this year or next which will ease and facilitate the return of cash from overseas locations. Well, we're kind of hedging our bets. We're not sure about the timing and we want to stay committed to shareholder returns and keep our tax structure in place until there are any substantive changes. So I think this raise, if anything, was to continue to support meaningful returns of capital to investors. And as we said on the call, we've returned over 100% over the last 5 years. In this past quarter, the total was over $380 million, I think, between dividends and buybacks. So I think we're very committed to shareholder returns. We will hit the model which is shrinking the share count. And if we get more line of sight to what's going to happen on the tax policy, then we'll clearly react more effectively and more efficiently to how to maximize those shareholder returns. In terms of the -- how's the year look, we gave in the call a few data points. One, we said that our revenues in '17 fiscal year versus '13 were going to be up 90%. So you can see, we're going to have a good year. So my take on it is, the year is a good year. Our take on it is the year will continue to strengthen throughout the year. Our take on it is that we're going to gain share this year. So it's going to be a really good year for us. And that's just semi. Display, we're going to do well, too. We believe those drivers that drive the market and our share continue for a number of years. So is the number a $40 billion number or north of a $40 billion number? All we want to say now here in early May is it starts with a 4. It's up significantly from last year and it strengthened all year. Operator Our next question comes from Farhan Ahmad of Crédit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad My question is, you've already talked about it quite a bit. Generally just wondering if you guys have done any sort of analysis if one particular segment would benefit more than the other in terms of logic, NAND or foundry? Gary Dickerson I think relative to AI, as I mentioned earlier, you see announcements almost every week of new logic AI chips going to the physical limits of the reticle field, so the physical limits or the ability of the semiconductor companies to build those chips. So a tremendous amount of transistors, vias, interconnect technology, all of that is in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. Our Transistor and Interconnect Group, all of those different products, epi, PVD, CMP, thermal processing, implant, are really unique and very strong positions for Applied Materials. So that growth is really exactly aligned with the products that we have in logic and in foundry and give us really a great growth opportunity. The other part of it's the materials enables memory scaling. More and more you're seeing devices going from 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions. And as they're going to 3 dimensions, really, the ability to scale the performance and also the cost is all about new materials, new deposition, epi, new etch technology, selective removal, all of those areas. And personally, I'm increasingly optimistic that we have very innovative, highly differentiated new technologies that will not only enable further scaling in 3D NAND technology, but also enable new memory technologies. Our position there is very, very strong. The relationships and the engagements that we have with customers are broader and deeper than we've ever had in the past. Operator Our next question comes from Atif Malik of Citi. Atif Malik I have a question on the display part. So at the Analyst Day last year, you guys talked about expanding the TAM on the display products from 15% to 30%, 40% over the next 2 years. Just curious, how are your engagements going with those new display products so far? Gary Dickerson So we have very broad and deep relationships with all the leading companies in display and also the leading consumer electronics companies that are using those displays. So we're in a really great position to enable these new technologies. And as customers are moving forward with new display technology, it increases our total available market and puts us in a good position to continue to grow that business. If you look at display overall, you really have 2 big drivers. One is the strong organic LED for mobile opportunity and that is a broadening out to a large number of customers and also, the increased adoption of larger TV screens. So both of those are driving our business. As I said earlier, we have very strong and deep relationships with leading customers and we're focused on the biggest technology challenges. If you look at all of those customers that want to get into the growing mobile OLED market, we're focused on the major technology challenges that enable those customers to build those kinds of devices. We're not ready to announce any specific opportunities at this point in time but we will later this year. Operator Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sreekrishnan Sankar The question I had was WFE running at 40 billion, 40 plus billion this year and next year, where do you think 3D NAND WFE is within that? And if the prices for NAND roll over, the reality of economics kick in and 3D NAND makers scale back the CapEx. Or do you think demand is strong enough to continue investing in capacity for the next 2 to 4 years? Robert Halliday Sure. So the question was, is 3D NAND going to keep expanding? Is that -- yes. So let me take a shot at that. So 3D NAND spending is up this year. It was up again last year. If you look at it, there's about 1.6 million wafer starts in the world of 3D NAND -- NAND in total. By the end of this year, they will convert at 750,000 wafer starts per month. So there's still a fair amount that's going to convert. I think that the vast majority that's going to convert over time because 3D performs better than 2D. I think what also helps memory in general, particularly NAND, is that more and more customers' customers are starting swap out 3D NAND over time for hard disk drives. So overall, demand for memory is going up. The share of NAND, far versus how this drive will trend up and 3D will be the NAND of choice versus 2D. So they're early in the build-out, 750,000. They got to get to 1.6 million. And we think that the installed capacity is going to go up over time because of this demand. Then if you look at greenfield versus refresh, we're kind of agnostic, frankly. So if you look at the cost of doing a greenfield 3D NAND factory, we do well. In fact, we're gaining share at virtually every product, I believe. If you look at transition of one 3D to a higher level of 3D, the revenue opportunity for us is about the same. Operator Our next question comes from Stephen Chin of UBS. Stephen Chin Just a follow-up question on the higher outlook for wafer fab equipment spending. What customer type is driving that big increase in your WFE? And do you think this $40 billion number is the new normalized level for WFE and not a peak? Robert Halliday Yes, it was seen across the board. We're seeing it at NAND, DRAM and foundry. Logic's kind of flattish. We're seeing it at almost every customer, I think, too. So it's very broad. And when you get that broad, it's not, hey, they're timing DRAM, they're putting more DRAM in a PC. The root cause is broader than that because it's across a wide range of device types of customers. So then you say, what is the application for driving? We do think it's more and more about more applications for your PC and your data center and stuff like that. So it does start to see these AI stuff, deep learning. Can I point exactly how much does AI I know? But it's across the board we're seeing this, right? So then in terms of the number, those are, I called earlier, I think this year begins with a 4. But I'm not saying it's 40, frankly. It's a good number and I think next year's a good number. So I actually think the new normal is 40 plus. I think what I worry about internally at the company, that we don't plan more for the upside than downside. I think there's more opportunity on the upside than the downside. Gary Dickerson One thing I'd add to that is that I think everybody is seeing a large increase in the amount of data and also the value of the data. If you look at deep learning, the amount of data that you process is going to go up. Right now, a lot of data's thrown away. So you've got an increase in the amount of data and then the amount of data that's processed is also going to increase. So both of those factors make me personally pretty bullish about the memory business long term. And certainly, that's also what we're hearing from our customers. Operator Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura. Romit Shah I did notice that display revenues were a little light in the quarter and that margins were down about 5 points. Can you talk about that, Bob? Is that just short term noise? And last quarter, you gave a target for display. I think it was up -- for 2017, up 50%. Do you still feel good about that? Robert Halliday Yes, we do. It's just timing and it's just logistical. Display's going to have a really good year. The underlying market dynamics are very strong for both TVs and mobile. And our position's really good. So I think display is strongly a lot of opportunity. And then we have a product cycle we've discussed coming on board later in the year. So I'm bullish on display and I think I wouldn't read too much in these quarterly numbers. In terms of the numbers we set last quarter, yes, we'll hit those. Yes. Operator Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari Bob, I had a question on gross margins. You guys showed nice upside in the quarter. And just wondering what the drivers were here. In the past, I think you pointed to outsized growth and things like etch and display that were headwinds to the business. The recent improvement, is that a function of that headwind abating? Or is that a combination of mix shift and also fundamental and sustainable improvement across the board? Robert Halliday Yes. If you look at a company like Applied, the gross margin improvement or change is a function primarily of 2 things and one third thing that's a little smaller. One is execution and second is mix and the third which is a little smaller, is absorption with volume, right? So if you look at execution, that's really three things, how you're executing cost reduction; how you're executing on new product development; and how you're executing in terms of field execution. So if you go look at it, this year, we're up a lot. We're up over a couple -- I don't know, several points. And if you look at it, I would say that the improvement -- we have underlying improved execution. So this year, we're up about almost, what, 3 points? So if you look at it this year, execution is trending up and that'll continue on for a while. I think every year, we'll get better.  Now we're benefiting from pretty good mix shifts. It's been a good year for our products in the TIG family, PVD, epi, things like that. And so it's helped a little bit. And absorption's helped a little bit this year. It's a pretty big year. It's over 40 and we're gaining share. But I would say that the overall gross margin performance of the company will trend up over time, but this year was helped a little bit by volume and by mix. But I would say I'm still positively upward bound on margins. So if you go -- if we have to redo a model in Analyst Day, I'd probably lean in on a higher WFE and higher margins. Operator Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore I wanted to follow up on some of the questions on the upward revision in WFE, particularly with regards to memory. We look at sort of memory cash flows and make some assumptions that there's just an algorithmic percentage of that peak cash flow that gets spent which is probably more negative than what you guys are describing that there are sort of people who are looking at the current situation and deciding that they need more supply. I mean, I guess it's more semantics, I guess. But how do you characterize when you see the upward revision that we've seen in just a 6-month window? How much of that is just because prices are better, companies have cash flow and they use it to improve their competitive position versus something that's more sort of structural and dynamic? How do you interpret it as more structural aspect versus just better pricing? Robert Halliday We look at a few things. Yes, we dug into this ourselves, too. We looked at what's driving this data. We looked at some cosmic data. So we looked at the stuff like how much data is captured out there. And we capture -- it was like 8 zettabytes of data was captured in 2016, I think, close to 25 zettabytes of data in 2020 and then it goes to like 45 zettabytes of data. So more and more data has been captured. It's gone up a lot, even in your homes, your cars, your industry, your companies. Then we look at the transmission, processing, source of that data we talked about. So when we start to look at root causes, we've seen a lot of this stuff, right? So then you go look at what's going on more close to planet Earth. And so we looked at this and we said, well, what's going on with NAND and DRAM? We split them up. DRAM's up but it's the still not through the roof. It's pretty good but still kind of restrained because a fair amount of this budget's being spent on NAND. So DRAM price is good. NAND price is good. Supply and demand's okay. So the DRAM, I would say, has probably gotten a little more upside than downside, frankly, in '18 because this year it hasn't been through the roof. It's up from what we thought earlier in the year. And then if you look at NAND, they're selling all the 3D NAND they can build. So it's still pretty good and I do think it goes to these longer term trends they have at NAND. So then if you look at the -- the final thing is just, well, how come you guys are low early in the year? And I think it goes to 2 root causes which, frankly, inflict all of us. One is I think we're a little bit a prisoner of past thinking. So okay, it can only go so high. But it goes to what Gary said earlier. There's different fundamental demand drivers at a simple level. It was, hey, use PCs. Then we agreed, okay, in 2010, mobile's coming in. And then -- but now you had all this big data stuff in content which is going up. That's what's really up last year. So it's content in the phones, content in the data centers, right? And so when you start to look, what were we inflicted with? We were saying, oh, we're going to roll over. But maybe there's real demand drivers here, number one. And number two, sometimes we listen too closely to our customers on a tactical basis.  They have to give us good demand forecast for kind of 6 months out so we could build the tools. Beyond that 6 months, maybe they're a little conservative to what they say to us for various reasons. So I think there are tactical reasons why we're a little too conservative. And I think that will -- data that shows it's not overbought now and there are longer term reasons that make you think this is very sustainable. Operator Our next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Patrick Ho Gary or Bob, in terms of the display business for you guys, we do see the longer term trends of OLED. Can you give a little bit of qualitative commentary on the LCD side of things, how you're benefiting this year as TV sizes do grow larger? Is this also one of those sustainable trends? Or is this just going to be a 1-year or 1.5-year phenomenon as the industry transitions on that front? Robert Halliday Yes, I'll start and Gary can jump in. Gary's TV aging is a little obsolete at his home base, but I'll start. So if you go look at this year, we're going to be strong in both TVs and mobile. TV's largely LCD. Mobile is -- the spending is largely for OLED, okay? So if you look at the 2 drivers, in OLED, it's conversion of the phones which we've talked about. My estimate is likely early in '18, about 37%, 38% of the phones, there'll be capacity to make them OLED even though the demand is there. We think it will be about 55%, as we said earlier in kind of 2020. I think it is 67%, 2021. So really, OLED phone displays is kind of supply constrained, to be honest with you. So that's very sustainable. I think it will keep going up beyond 67% is my opinion, too, in 2021. I remember everything, we got backlog kind of ships 6 to 9 months later. So you have extra length on the revenue. Then if you go to TVs, what's really driving the TVs is the big TVs. So we said at Analyst Day that through 2020, I think it was, we're tracking 7 Gen 10.5 fabs. We're now up to 9. And so -- and those [indiscernible] is just starting to ship, okay? And those fabs, on average, spend more than a Gen 8.5. I think there's been about $2.2 billion where it's like $1.2 billion, I think, on a Gen 8.5. So this big TV stuff's got legs for a while. And the capital intensity for these bigger fabs is good and our position's real good. Operator Our next question comes from Weston Twigg of Pacific Crest Securities. Weston Twigg You mentioned earlier on the call regarding bit density and 3D NAND from generation to generation being slower than the planar NAND conversion. So just wondering, could you give us an idea on how much more fab capacity might be needed annually to drive, say, 40% bit growth and what the incremental opportunity can be for AMAT? Robert Halliday Sure. Some of this goes to what I said earlier. So we see and I think we're a little bit on the low side sometimes, that NAND bit growth is going to be probably in the high 30s or something like that. Now last year was much higher. If you look at content in phones, it was up like -- the data we got from an outside service provider was 57%. So there are indications that we're on the low side on some of these things. Plus we're not sure we've captured all the movement to hard disk drives. So I'd say I'm more on the over camp in that number than the under. So then if you go look at it, as I said earlier, the 750,000 wafer starts by the end of this year, we think that they're going to have to continue to spend in dollars WFE content similar to this year for a number of years. Now if they spend on greenfield or they spend on conversions, we're kind of agnostic from a revenue point of view. But we think the total spending is similar to this year for a number of years. Operator Our next question comes from Craig Ellis of B. Riley. Craig Ellis I wanted to follow up on the comments that you had, Bob, that there were some project-related R&D spending in the outlooks numbers. The question is to what extent is that more of a near term micro opportunity that the company is using versus something that may be more longer term and structural, either because you're viewing the market opportunity differently over the next few years and are chasing some additional existing SAM or as you look at different opportunities, chasing some new SAM that's emerged over the last 3 to 6 months? Robert Halliday Yes. I think increasing the R&D spend was a wise decision, frankly. I think that when we showed you the model -- if you go back to 2013 when I first got here, we showed the first model. Our base case model was kind of a $30 billion base case. And then we did a $33.5 billion. Last year, it was $34.5 billion, I think. If I had to do a base case model for the industry, it's probably -- it's going to be north of that. I don't want to presell Analyst Day in September, but it's obviously north of that. The second thing is our position's a lot stronger. We used to be 18% of WFE and I think last year, we were like 22% or something. We're still going up. Our model is to hit the 25.5%.  We're comfortable with that. So if you look at Applied and then display, the magnitude of the change is big or bigger. It was an $8 billion spending environment when we set up and now it's kind of twice that. Our product pipeline is good. So I think the wise decision is to continue to invest in the opportunities. Now customers are coming to us more and more because we've become even more innovative than we were. So if you look at the range of products we're doing, the innovation in terms of the pipeline, really good. So we're getting lots of pull from customers to develop new products. They're taking more and more demo tools from us. We're getting more and more applications. So I think it's money well spent. I think it'll probably trend up. If you look at the model, probably a little bit of risk that the OpEx is higher than the model, but OpEx as a percentage of sales is down 10 points from 2013 by the end of this year. If you look at operating margins, they're up significantly and will probably beat the model. The upside's lower than the downside on the revenue gross margin, operating margins in the model. Gary Dickerson In terms of where we're focused, the strategy for us has been inflection-focused innovation. There are really big inflections that are happening at 10- and 7-nanometer. When you're building these AI chips that are as big as the physical limits, there are a lot of technology challenges. We talked about PVD growing this last year to enable the interconnect -- new interconnect technology for lower-power devices. You've got high-performance memory chips also where the PVD is growing for us. And in the -- and the memory area, the ability to scale 3D NAND, is there's big technical challenges there for our customers. And it's really all about etch, deposition. We've got very innovative new materials. The etch area, we've grown our market share significantly over the last few years. Great products, some of the best products I've ever seen in my life. Sym3 is the fastest-growing product in the history of the company. The Selectra product, where we have 1,000 to 1 selectivity. These are enabling customers to build devices that were never possible before and build them in different ways, scale these new technologies, build the logic devices at the physical limits or -- and the same thing is true in display. For organic LED mobile displays, there are technology challenges that are facing customers that want to ramp new factories for those new types of devices. So for me, personally, we've -- I look at Applied Materials, our competencies, technologies, talent is really unbelievable and sets us apart from any other company. And we're really in a sweet spot of all of these major inflections. So we've certainly moved a lot of money within the company over the last few years. The OpEx as a percentage of revenue has been going done. But we're going to invest to enable these inflections and drive sustainable growth for the company. The opportunities for us have never been better. Operator Our next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham. Edwin Mok Just want to circle back on China. You guys mentioned expect a pretty significant pickup in spending in China in 2018. Maybe if I -- we focus on the memory side. We've seen like some of these customer announce pretty aggressive road map for the 3D NAND technology. Just wondering, is this bigger spending in '18 predicated on those customer hitting those targets or rolling out those devices and if they have issues going on with the devices that delay the spending that you expect in '18? Gary Dickerson We have a range of forecast for China. So as I said earlier, it's one of our strongest regions in both semiconductor and display. We have very, very deep relationships with many of these customers. Right now, what we believe for 2018 is that the business will be up meaningfully from 2017. But frankly, that's also at the most likely and low risk end of the forecast. There's a higher range there that would be going up at a much faster pace. We're looking at early indicators for all of those new projects, but I think right now, we're pretty confident that the increase in China in 2018 will happen. Maybe it's $1 billion, $1.5 billion in terms of total wafer fab equipment. So that we have pretty high confidence in terms of the engagements or the information we're getting from all of those customers. There is upside potential, but that's our current view. Operator Our next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Shek Ho Going back to the question on capital returns, your free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has come up quite a bit over the past 5 years. I think it was averaging like 15% and now it was more like 20%-plus. Your dividend yield has come down quite a bit as well just because your stock has done so well. But with the long term debt you raised recently, I know you explained that earlier in the call, but just curious, are there any changes to your philosophy in capital returns? I guess specifically, why not raise your dividend and maybe spend a little less on buybacks and -- given dividend hasn't gone up for a number of years? Or are you saving some dry powder for future M&A? Robert Halliday I think we'll probably -- I think we'll continue to return -- the total of all cash to investors will be very, very healthy. I think that the mix will probably morph over time through dividends. We haven't made a firm commitment but I think it will happen. I think the 2 things that I'm kind of watching is, one, I think I'd like to see tax policy because dividend's a firm, fixed commitment. As soon as you make it, then you got to hit it every quarter. And you really have to lean into where you're going to end up, what's your end stake, because people look at the yield, not with -- did you raise it $0.02 a quarter. So we have to commit to a dividend increase over time that gets to effective yield. And with the stock going up, that cash commitment has gone up. So I'm willing to do that, but I'd like to see clarity on the tax policy before I make that fixed commitment to an increasing yield. Michael Sullivan Thanks, Sydney, for the question. And Latiff, time check. I just want to see if there's anyone in the queue still. Operator Yes, sir, we do have one more question in queue. Michael Sullivan Okay. Thank you. We'll take that question and then we'll bring it back to me. Thanks. Operator That question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Harlan Sur You guys talked a lot about some of the trends driving logic and foundry, AI, deep learning, VR, data center. And it's interesting because these drivers have some of the biggest chip sizes in the industry, right? In videos, the latest deep learning chip has 18 billion transistors on a single piece of silicon. Broadcom's latest data center switching chip has like 7 billion transistors. These are huge chips, right? My point is that each of these units is consuming more silicon but they're also requiring more leading-edge complex manufacturing. So this is great for capital intensity trends. It's great for equipment business. But frankly, it's a nightmare from a yield perspective. So help us understand the trends you're seeing in your metrology and inspection business and how you guys are helping your customers improve yields. You guys gained share in this segment last year. How do you think this segment grows relative to your overall semi systems business this year? Gary Dickerson Okay. Thanks for the question, Harlan. Yes. Again, on the large logic chips that you talked about, we actually had the NVIDIA CEO here just a few months ago. And one of the questions was, really, what does all of this mean to us? And he talked about physical, the chip's as big as they can physically build them. And actually, he also said, a million times more memory. So all of those things are obviously positive for Applied Materials. In inspection share, we're -- or inspection business, we're growing significant amount. We had record revenue in '16. We're on track for record revenue in '17. And if you look at our e-beam business which is our largest part of PDC which includes e-beam inspection, e-beam review and CD-SEM, we're going to be up in '17 more than 50% versus '15. We have very, very strong technology position with world-class electron optics and very strong customer pull for e-beam products in logic, foundry and repeat orders for the PROVision in memory with some large customers. So very, very strong position. We have great technology, very strong customer pull and we believe that we're going to continue the growth that we've seen over the last couple of years in our PDC business. Michael Sullivan Great. Well, thanks, Harlan, for the question. And Bob, would you like to add anything else before we close the call? Robert Halliday Sure. Thanks, Mike. One of Gary's favorite expressions around here is innovation's about connecting the dots. Let me see if I connect a few dots that I -- we believe and I hope you heard today. One, we believe the wafer fab equipment market is sustainably higher and less volatile. Also, display is higher and for Applied, it's sustainably a better market because there are more technology inflections and because we're growing our served market. Second, Applied's position in the market is sustainably stronger. And we're executing better and better. And third, we're generating more free cash flow and returning the excess to our shareholders. Speaking of free cash flow, one of your own interesting note comparing Applied Materials to some of the top names in the industrial sector. Relative to the average of the companies, Applied has higher revenue and profit growth along with higher ROIC and free cash flow margins. Compared to these companies, I believe we're being discounted for being more cyclical even as we become demonstrably less cyclical. I believe that over time, we'll be viewed and valued in a new way. So thank you for your time today. And we look forward to seeing many of you in person over the next few weeks. Michael Sullivan Well, great. Thanks, Bob. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. A replay of the call is going to be available on the website beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. And we thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, you may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.

Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Christopher Muse I guess question around sustainability. You're guiding WFE $40-plus billion here for '17. And curious, what gives you the confidence to be so upbeat looking into '18 and beyond? And I guess as part of that, would love to hear your thoughts in terms of the contributions from areas like AI and public cloud investments versus, I guess, more traditional areas like smartphone and PCs in the past. Robert Halliday Sure. Let me see if I can try to give you context. I think context rather than point answer is useful, give you context over time and context over breadth. So if you look at context, we thought back at Analyst Day last September that 2016 WFE would be about $33.7 billion. And in fact, it ended up a little over $35 billion. We thought at Analyst Day last year, this year would be $34.5 billion. And in fact, it started with a 4 number this year and it looks very healthy. So it's trending up. So then you say, well, where is it trending up? It's kind of up across the board. Earlier in the year, we thought it was kind of 5% up across the board. Now we think the whole thing is up 15%. We're seeing in DRAM, NAND, foundry. Tactically, we're seeing high utilization in all the fabs. We see no diminution of ordering patterns. We don't see double bookings or anything people might fear. So we see -- when you see strength across virtually every customer and virtually every device type, that goes to some root cause questions. So in my opinion, we're facing what we've been talking about for a while which is, there is more root cause demand drivers for devices. Now longer term, those root drive cause factors are going to be things like cars and AR/VR. What we're seeing now is tactically more content in the phones. We see a lot more content in the phones around NAND, DRAM and we also see strength within the processor side on both the cutting edge and the lagging edge. Lagging edge, again, this year, will be over 40% of device types. But the cutting edge is pretty strong, too. So we're seeing broadscale demand. My belief is that in the intermediate term, there's more content going in phones and more going into the big data centers which are both driving this which will help us. So then the question is, why is there more going in? We believe that there's, what I call broadly speaking, more applications for processor technology, more apps on top of it that are driving systemic demand. And I think, frankly, we're in the early innings of it. So if you ask me, okay, is the second half good? Yes, we're okay. If you ask me, is '18 good? Yes, I think it probably starts with a 4 again. It's pretty good. If you ask me long term which is what I spend a lot of time on, I see more root cause drivers for growth in semiconductor and silicon growth than I've seen in years and I think it's sustainable. Gary Dickerson And C.J., this is Gary. If you look out over time what drove our business in the past were the enterprise and PC upgrade cycles, then it moved to mobile, social media, very pervasive and driven by holiday season new products, where all of the consumer electronics companies had to have those products ready for Christmas or Chinese New Year. And as you go forward, we talked about AI and the importance of capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data is really going to disrupt big industries, transportation, health care, entertainment, manufacturing. And when you look at AI chips, almost every week, somebody's announcing a new AI chip, that it's at the -- logic devices that are at the physical limits of how big they can build those chips because there's so much value in these changes that are happening in these major industries. And of course, that's great for us. If you're building these big logic chips, you need better transistors, you need much better interconnect technology and you also need more memory which is materials-enabled and another area that's in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. So longer term, these inflections really create even more sustainability in terms of our markets going forward. Operator Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Harlan Sur On the China domestic semiconductor market and the outlook there, especially as we think about looking into 2018, I think conservatively, we're tracking 3 to 4 domestic foundry programs and about 4 to 5 memory programs. Foundry, obviously, is a bit more mature. Memory, we're kind of early innings, like Phase 1 kind of development. But especially on sort of memory in China and we get this question a lot from investors which is, is the team starting to get pipeline visibility into some of these programs actually starting to fire the confidence level that these programs are going to contribute to potentially a growth outlook for 2018? Love to get your views here. Gary Dickerson Yes, thanks for the question. China's one of our strongest regions for both semiconductor and display, very deep customer relationships. And what we're looking at for 2017, if we compare to '15, it's about 2x growth in our semiconductor business, 50% growth in service, 50% in display. And the business is really driven by a couple of different strategic factors. One is, there's a big gap between supply and demand and there's this large drive to try to close that gap and then also building a secure supply chain. When we look into 2018, what we're seeing right now is that the overall wafer fab equipment spending could be meaningfully up, more than $1 billion, maybe $1.5 billion from '17 to '18 and the domestic part of that increase is also up a meaningful amount in 2018. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything else? Robert Halliday Yes, I think that's pretty accurate. And if you ask us to look longer term, we see the domestic -- we see the total going up basically every year and the domestic part, in particular, going up every year. Operator Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company. Timothy Arcuri Bob, I actually have 2 questions. Number one, just on the recent debt raise. I know you paid down $200 million of debt with that money. But I'm surprised that there's not kind of a new capital return that was announced with that. So I guess that's my first question. And then I wanted to also ask about SSG in the back half of the year because if I run the numbers on calendar first half of the year, you're sort of annualizing to like $42 billion WFE roughly. And if we're going to be at $40 billion for the year, then that would sort of say that the back half has to be down like roughly 10%. So I'm wondering if that math's right. Robert Halliday Yes, 2 complicated questions. The first one, we raised money frankly from an opportunistic point of view and frankly a shareholder perspective. So if you look it, we raised $2.2 billion, now we had to repay $2 billion -- $200 million, so it's about $2 billion net. And it was about 50% of it was 10-year money, about 50% was 30-year money. And the 10% money, maybe like 3.3% and 4.3%, okay? So the average rate is about 3.8%. So basically what we're bringing into our capital structure is long term debt at low rates that's pseudo-equity at low cost of capital. So that's pretty attractive. The second thing we're doing, many people believe that there'll be some type of tax policy change this year or next which will ease and facilitate the return of cash from overseas locations. Well, we're kind of hedging our bets. We're not sure about the timing and we want to stay committed to shareholder returns and keep our tax structure in place until there are any substantive changes. So I think this raise, if anything, was to continue to support meaningful returns of capital to investors. And as we said on the call, we've returned over 100% over the last 5 years. In this past quarter, the total was over $380 million, I think, between dividends and buybacks. So I think we're very committed to shareholder returns. We will hit the model which is shrinking the share count. And if we get more line of sight to what's going to happen on the tax policy, then we'll clearly react more effectively and more efficiently to how to maximize those shareholder returns. In terms of the -- how's the year look, we gave in the call a few data points. One, we said that our revenues in '17 fiscal year versus '13 were going to be up 90%. So you can see, we're going to have a good year. So my take on it is, the year is a good year. Our take on it is the year will continue to strengthen throughout the year. Our take on it is that we're going to gain share this year. So it's going to be a really good year for us. And that's just semi. Display, we're going to do well, too. We believe those drivers that drive the market and our share continue for a number of years. So is the number a $40 billion number or north of a $40 billion number? All we want to say now here in early May is it starts with a 4. It's up significantly from last year and it strengthened all year. Operator Our next question comes from Farhan Ahmad of Crédit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad My question is, you've already talked about it quite a bit. Generally just wondering if you guys have done any sort of analysis if one particular segment would benefit more than the other in terms of logic, NAND or foundry? Gary Dickerson I think relative to AI, as I mentioned earlier, you see announcements almost every week of new logic AI chips going to the physical limits of the reticle field, so the physical limits or the ability of the semiconductor companies to build those chips. So a tremendous amount of transistors, vias, interconnect technology, all of that is in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. Our Transistor and Interconnect Group, all of those different products, epi, PVD, CMP, thermal processing, implant, are really unique and very strong positions for Applied Materials. So that growth is really exactly aligned with the products that we have in logic and in foundry and give us really a great growth opportunity. The other part of it's the materials enables memory scaling. More and more you're seeing devices going from 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions. And as they're going to 3 dimensions, really, the ability to scale the performance and also the cost is all about new materials, new deposition, epi, new etch technology, selective removal, all of those areas. And personally, I'm increasingly optimistic that we have very innovative, highly differentiated new technologies that will not only enable further scaling in 3D NAND technology, but also enable new memory technologies. Our position there is very, very strong. The relationships and the engagements that we have with customers are broader and deeper than we've ever had in the past. Operator Our next question comes from Atif Malik of Citi. Atif Malik I have a question on the display part. So at the Analyst Day last year, you guys talked about expanding the TAM on the display products from 15% to 30%, 40% over the next 2 years. Just curious, how are your engagements going with those new display products so far? Gary Dickerson So we have very broad and deep relationships with all the leading companies in display and also the leading consumer electronics companies that are using those displays. So we're in a really great position to enable these new technologies. And as customers are moving forward with new display technology, it increases our total available market and puts us in a good position to continue to grow that business. If you look at display overall, you really have 2 big drivers. One is the strong organic LED for mobile opportunity and that is a broadening out to a large number of customers and also, the increased adoption of larger TV screens. So both of those are driving our business. As I said earlier, we have very strong and deep relationships with leading customers and we're focused on the biggest technology challenges. If you look at all of those customers that want to get into the growing mobile OLED market, we're focused on the major technology challenges that enable those customers to build those kinds of devices. We're not ready to announce any specific opportunities at this point in time but we will later this year. Operator Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sreekrishnan Sankar The question I had was WFE running at 40 billion, 40 plus billion this year and next year, where do you think 3D NAND WFE is within that? And if the prices for NAND roll over, the reality of economics kick in and 3D NAND makers scale back the CapEx. Or do you think demand is strong enough to continue investing in capacity for the next 2 to 4 years? Robert Halliday Sure. So the question was, is 3D NAND going to keep expanding? Is that -- yes. So let me take a shot at that. So 3D NAND spending is up this year. It was up again last year. If you look at it, there's about 1.6 million wafer starts in the world of 3D NAND -- NAND in total. By the end of this year, they will convert at 750,000 wafer starts per month. So there's still a fair amount that's going to convert. I think that the vast majority that's going to convert over time because 3D performs better than 2D. I think what also helps memory in general, particularly NAND, is that more and more customers' customers are starting swap out 3D NAND over time for hard disk drives. So overall, demand for memory is going up. The share of NAND, far versus how this drive will trend up and 3D will be the NAND of choice versus 2D. So they're early in the build-out, 750,000. They got to get to 1.6 million. And we think that the installed capacity is going to go up over time because of this demand. Then if you look at greenfield versus refresh, we're kind of agnostic, frankly. So if you look at the cost of doing a greenfield 3D NAND factory, we do well. In fact, we're gaining share at virtually every product, I believe. If you look at transition of one 3D to a higher level of 3D, the revenue opportunity for us is about the same. Operator Our next question comes from Stephen Chin of UBS. Stephen Chin Just a follow-up question on the higher outlook for wafer fab equipment spending. What customer type is driving that big increase in your WFE? And do you think this $40 billion number is the new normalized level for WFE and not a peak? Robert Halliday Yes, it was seen across the board. We're seeing it at NAND, DRAM and foundry. Logic's kind of flattish. We're seeing it at almost every customer, I think, too. So it's very broad. And when you get that broad, it's not, hey, they're timing DRAM, they're putting more DRAM in a PC. The root cause is broader than that because it's across a wide range of device types of customers. So then you say, what is the application for driving? We do think it's more and more about more applications for your PC and your data center and stuff like that. So it does start to see these AI stuff, deep learning. Can I point exactly how much does AI I know? But it's across the board we're seeing this, right? So then in terms of the number, those are, I called earlier, I think this year begins with a 4. But I'm not saying it's 40, frankly. It's a good number and I think next year's a good number. So I actually think the new normal is 40 plus. I think what I worry about internally at the company, that we don't plan more for the upside than downside. I think there's more opportunity on the upside than the downside. Gary Dickerson One thing I'd add to that is that I think everybody is seeing a large increase in the amount of data and also the value of the data. If you look at deep learning, the amount of data that you process is going to go up. Right now, a lot of data's thrown away. So you've got an increase in the amount of data and then the amount of data that's processed is also going to increase. So both of those factors make me personally pretty bullish about the memory business long term. And certainly, that's also what we're hearing from our customers. Operator Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura. Romit Shah I did notice that display revenues were a little light in the quarter and that margins were down about 5 points. Can you talk about that, Bob? Is that just short term noise? And last quarter, you gave a target for display. I think it was up -- for 2017, up 50%. Do you still feel good about that? Robert Halliday Yes, we do. It's just timing and it's just logistical. Display's going to have a really good year. The underlying market dynamics are very strong for both TVs and mobile. And our position's really good. So I think display is strongly a lot of opportunity. And then we have a product cycle we've discussed coming on board later in the year. So I'm bullish on display and I think I wouldn't read too much in these quarterly numbers. In terms of the numbers we set last quarter, yes, we'll hit those. Yes. Operator Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari Bob, I had a question on gross margins. You guys showed nice upside in the quarter. And just wondering what the drivers were here. In the past, I think you pointed to outsized growth and things like etch and display that were headwinds to the business. The recent improvement, is that a function of that headwind abating? Or is that a combination of mix shift and also fundamental and sustainable improvement across the board? Robert Halliday Yes. If you look at a company like Applied, the gross margin improvement or change is a function primarily of 2 things and one third thing that's a little smaller. One is execution and second is mix and the third which is a little smaller, is absorption with volume, right? So if you look at execution, that's really three things, how you're executing cost reduction; how you're executing on new product development; and how you're executing in terms of field execution. So if you go look at it, this year, we're up a lot. We're up over a couple -- I don't know, several points. And if you look at it, I would say that the improvement -- we have underlying improved execution. So this year, we're up about almost, what, 3 points? So if you look at it this year, execution is trending up and that'll continue on for a while. I think every year, we'll get better.  Now we're benefiting from pretty good mix shifts. It's been a good year for our products in the TIG family, PVD, epi, things like that. And so it's helped a little bit. And absorption's helped a little bit this year. It's a pretty big year. It's over 40 and we're gaining share. But I would say that the overall gross margin performance of the company will trend up over time, but this year was helped a little bit by volume and by mix. But I would say I'm still positively upward bound on margins. So if you go -- if we have to redo a model in Analyst Day, I'd probably lean in on a higher WFE and higher margins. Operator Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore I wanted to follow up on some of the questions on the upward revision in WFE, particularly with regards to memory. We look at sort of memory cash flows and make some assumptions that there's just an algorithmic percentage of that peak cash flow that gets spent which is probably more negative than what you guys are describing that there are sort of people who are looking at the current situation and deciding that they need more supply. I mean, I guess it's more semantics, I guess. But how do you characterize when you see the upward revision that we've seen in just a 6-month window? How much of that is just because prices are better, companies have cash flow and they use it to improve their competitive position versus something that's more sort of structural and dynamic? How do you interpret it as more structural aspect versus just better pricing? Robert Halliday We look at a few things. Yes, we dug into this ourselves, too. We looked at what's driving this data. We looked at some cosmic data. So we looked at the stuff like how much data is captured out there. And we capture -- it was like 8 zettabytes of data was captured in 2016, I think, close to 25 zettabytes of data in 2020 and then it goes to like 45 zettabytes of data. So more and more data has been captured. It's gone up a lot, even in your homes, your cars, your industry, your companies. Then we look at the transmission, processing, source of that data we talked about. So when we start to look at root causes, we've seen a lot of this stuff, right? So then you go look at what's going on more close to planet Earth. And so we looked at this and we said, well, what's going on with NAND and DRAM? We split them up. DRAM's up but it's the still not through the roof. It's pretty good but still kind of restrained because a fair amount of this budget's being spent on NAND. So DRAM price is good. NAND price is good. Supply and demand's okay. So the DRAM, I would say, has probably gotten a little more upside than downside, frankly, in '18 because this year it hasn't been through the roof. It's up from what we thought earlier in the year. And then if you look at NAND, they're selling all the 3D NAND they can build. So it's still pretty good and I do think it goes to these longer term trends they have at NAND. So then if you look at the -- the final thing is just, well, how come you guys are low early in the year? And I think it goes to 2 root causes which, frankly, inflict all of us. One is I think we're a little bit a prisoner of past thinking. So okay, it can only go so high. But it goes to what Gary said earlier. There's different fundamental demand drivers at a simple level. It was, hey, use PCs. Then we agreed, okay, in 2010, mobile's coming in. And then -- but now you had all this big data stuff in content which is going up. That's what's really up last year. So it's content in the phones, content in the data centers, right? And so when you start to look, what were we inflicted with? We were saying, oh, we're going to roll over. But maybe there's real demand drivers here, number one. And number two, sometimes we listen too closely to our customers on a tactical basis.  They have to give us good demand forecast for kind of 6 months out so we could build the tools. Beyond that 6 months, maybe they're a little conservative to what they say to us for various reasons. So I think there are tactical reasons why we're a little too conservative. And I think that will -- data that shows it's not overbought now and there are longer term reasons that make you think this is very sustainable. Operator Our next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Patrick Ho Gary or Bob, in terms of the display business for you guys, we do see the longer term trends of OLED. Can you give a little bit of qualitative commentary on the LCD side of things, how you're benefiting this year as TV sizes do grow larger? Is this also one of those sustainable trends? Or is this just going to be a 1-year or 1.5-year phenomenon as the industry transitions on that front? Robert Halliday Yes, I'll start and Gary can jump in. Gary's TV aging is a little obsolete at his home base, but I'll start. So if you go look at this year, we're going to be strong in both TVs and mobile. TV's largely LCD. Mobile is -- the spending is largely for OLED, okay? So if you look at the 2 drivers, in OLED, it's conversion of the phones which we've talked about. My estimate is likely early in '18, about 37%, 38% of the phones, there'll be capacity to make them OLED even though the demand is there. We think it will be about 55%, as we said earlier in kind of 2020. I think it is 67%, 2021. So really, OLED phone displays is kind of supply constrained, to be honest with you. So that's very sustainable. I think it will keep going up beyond 67% is my opinion, too, in 2021. I remember everything, we got backlog kind of ships 6 to 9 months later. So you have extra length on the revenue. Then if you go to TVs, what's really driving the TVs is the big TVs. So we said at Analyst Day that through 2020, I think it was, we're tracking 7 Gen 10.5 fabs. We're now up to 9. And so -- and those [indiscernible] is just starting to ship, okay? And those fabs, on average, spend more than a Gen 8.5. I think there's been about $2.2 billion where it's like $1.2 billion, I think, on a Gen 8.5. So this big TV stuff's got legs for a while. And the capital intensity for these bigger fabs is good and our position's real good. Operator Our next question comes from Weston Twigg of Pacific Crest Securities. Weston Twigg You mentioned earlier on the call regarding bit density and 3D NAND from generation to generation being slower than the planar NAND conversion. So just wondering, could you give us an idea on how much more fab capacity might be needed annually to drive, say, 40% bit growth and what the incremental opportunity can be for AMAT? Robert Halliday Sure. Some of this goes to what I said earlier. So we see and I think we're a little bit on the low side sometimes, that NAND bit growth is going to be probably in the high 30s or something like that. Now last year was much higher. If you look at content in phones, it was up like -- the data we got from an outside service provider was 57%. So there are indications that we're on the low side on some of these things. Plus we're not sure we've captured all the movement to hard disk drives. So I'd say I'm more on the over camp in that number than the under. So then if you go look at it, as I said earlier, the 750,000 wafer starts by the end of this year, we think that they're going to have to continue to spend in dollars WFE content similar to this year for a number of years. Now if they spend on greenfield or they spend on conversions, we're kind of agnostic from a revenue point of view. But we think the total spending is similar to this year for a number of years. Operator Our next question comes from Craig Ellis of B. Riley. Craig Ellis I wanted to follow up on the comments that you had, Bob, that there were some project-related R&D spending in the outlooks numbers. The question is to what extent is that more of a near term micro opportunity that the company is using versus something that may be more longer term and structural, either because you're viewing the market opportunity differently over the next few years and are chasing some additional existing SAM or as you look at different opportunities, chasing some new SAM that's emerged over the last 3 to 6 months? Robert Halliday Yes. I think increasing the R&D spend was a wise decision, frankly. I think that when we showed you the model -- if you go back to 2013 when I first got here, we showed the first model. Our base case model was kind of a $30 billion base case. And then we did a $33.5 billion. Last year, it was $34.5 billion, I think. If I had to do a base case model for the industry, it's probably -- it's going to be north of that. I don't want to presell Analyst Day in September, but it's obviously north of that. The second thing is our position's a lot stronger. We used to be 18% of WFE and I think last year, we were like 22% or something. We're still going up. Our model is to hit the 25.5%.  We're comfortable with that. So if you look at Applied and then display, the magnitude of the change is big or bigger. It was an $8 billion spending environment when we set up and now it's kind of twice that. Our product pipeline is good. So I think the wise decision is to continue to invest in the opportunities. Now customers are coming to us more and more because we've become even more innovative than we were. So if you look at the range of products we're doing, the innovation in terms of the pipeline, really good. So we're getting lots of pull from customers to develop new products. They're taking more and more demo tools from us. We're getting more and more applications. So I think it's money well spent. I think it'll probably trend up. If you look at the model, probably a little bit of risk that the OpEx is higher than the model, but OpEx as a percentage of sales is down 10 points from 2013 by the end of this year. If you look at operating margins, they're up significantly and will probably beat the model. The upside's lower than the downside on the revenue gross margin, operating margins in the model. Gary Dickerson In terms of where we're focused, the strategy for us has been inflection-focused innovation. There are really big inflections that are happening at 10- and 7-nanometer. When you're building these AI chips that are as big as the physical limits, there are a lot of technology challenges. We talked about PVD growing this last year to enable the interconnect -- new interconnect technology for lower-power devices. You've got high-performance memory chips also where the PVD is growing for us. And in the -- and the memory area, the ability to scale 3D NAND, is there's big technical challenges there for our customers. And it's really all about etch, deposition. We've got very innovative new materials. The etch area, we've grown our market share significantly over the last few years. Great products, some of the best products I've ever seen in my life. Sym3 is the fastest-growing product in the history of the company. The Selectra product, where we have 1,000 to 1 selectivity. These are enabling customers to build devices that were never possible before and build them in different ways, scale these new technologies, build the logic devices at the physical limits or -- and the same thing is true in display. For organic LED mobile displays, there are technology challenges that are facing customers that want to ramp new factories for those new types of devices. So for me, personally, we've -- I look at Applied Materials, our competencies, technologies, talent is really unbelievable and sets us apart from any other company. And we're really in a sweet spot of all of these major inflections. So we've certainly moved a lot of money within the company over the last few years. The OpEx as a percentage of revenue has been going done. But we're going to invest to enable these inflections and drive sustainable growth for the company. The opportunities for us have never been better. Operator Our next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham. Edwin Mok Just want to circle back on China. You guys mentioned expect a pretty significant pickup in spending in China in 2018. Maybe if I -- we focus on the memory side. We've seen like some of these customer announce pretty aggressive road map for the 3D NAND technology. Just wondering, is this bigger spending in '18 predicated on those customer hitting those targets or rolling out those devices and if they have issues going on with the devices that delay the spending that you expect in '18? Gary Dickerson We have a range of forecast for China. So as I said earlier, it's one of our strongest regions in both semiconductor and display. We have very, very deep relationships with many of these customers. Right now, what we believe for 2018 is that the business will be up meaningfully from 2017. But frankly, that's also at the most likely and low risk end of the forecast. There's a higher range there that would be going up at a much faster pace. We're looking at early indicators for all of those new projects, but I think right now, we're pretty confident that the increase in China in 2018 will happen. Maybe it's $1 billion, $1.5 billion in terms of total wafer fab equipment. So that we have pretty high confidence in terms of the engagements or the information we're getting from all of those customers. There is upside potential, but that's our current view. Operator Our next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Shek Ho Going back to the question on capital returns, your free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has come up quite a bit over the past 5 years. I think it was averaging like 15% and now it was more like 20%-plus. Your dividend yield has come down quite a bit as well just because your stock has done so well. But with the long term debt you raised recently, I know you explained that earlier in the call, but just curious, are there any changes to your philosophy in capital returns? I guess specifically, why not raise your dividend and maybe spend a little less on buybacks and -- given dividend hasn't gone up for a number of years? Or are you saving some dry powder for future M&A? Robert Halliday I think we'll probably -- I think we'll continue to return -- the total of all cash to investors will be very, very healthy. I think that the mix will probably morph over time through dividends. We haven't made a firm commitment but I think it will happen. I think the 2 things that I'm kind of watching is, one, I think I'd like to see tax policy because dividend's a firm, fixed commitment. As soon as you make it, then you got to hit it every quarter. And you really have to lean into where you're going to end up, what's your end stake, because people look at the yield, not with -- did you raise it $0.02 a quarter. So we have to commit to a dividend increase over time that gets to effective yield. And with the stock going up, that cash commitment has gone up. So I'm willing to do that, but I'd like to see clarity on the tax policy before I make that fixed commitment to an increasing yield. Michael Sullivan Thanks, Sydney, for the question. And Latiff, time check. I just want to see if there's anyone in the queue still. Operator Yes, sir, we do have one more question in queue. Michael Sullivan Okay. Thank you. We'll take that question and then we'll bring it back to me. Thanks. Operator That question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Harlan Sur You guys talked a lot about some of the trends driving logic and foundry, AI, deep learning, VR, data center. And it's interesting because these drivers have some of the biggest chip sizes in the industry, right? In videos, the latest deep learning chip has 18 billion transistors on a single piece of silicon. Broadcom's latest data center switching chip has like 7 billion transistors. These are huge chips, right? My point is that each of these units is consuming more silicon but they're also requiring more leading-edge complex manufacturing. So this is great for capital intensity trends. It's great for equipment business. But frankly, it's a nightmare from a yield perspective. So help us understand the trends you're seeing in your metrology and inspection business and how you guys are helping your customers improve yields. You guys gained share in this segment last year. How do you think this segment grows relative to your overall semi systems business this year? Gary Dickerson Okay. Thanks for the question, Harlan. Yes. Again, on the large logic chips that you talked about, we actually had the NVIDIA CEO here just a few months ago. And one of the questions was, really, what does all of this mean to us? And he talked about physical, the chip's as big as they can physically build them. And actually, he also said, a million times more memory. So all of those things are obviously positive for Applied Materials. In inspection share, we're -- or inspection business, we're growing significant amount. We had record revenue in '16. We're on track for record revenue in '17. And if you look at our e-beam business which is our largest part of PDC which includes e-beam inspection, e-beam review and CD-SEM, we're going to be up in '17 more than 50% versus '15. We have very, very strong technology position with world-class electron optics and very strong customer pull for e-beam products in logic, foundry and repeat orders for the PROVision in memory with some large customers. So very, very strong position. We have great technology, very strong customer pull and we believe that we're going to continue the growth that we've seen over the last couple of years in our PDC business. Michael Sullivan Great. Well, thanks, Harlan, for the question. And Bob, would you like to add anything else before we close the call? Robert Halliday Sure. Thanks, Mike. One of Gary's favorite expressions around here is innovation's about connecting the dots. Let me see if I connect a few dots that I -- we believe and I hope you heard today. One, we believe the wafer fab equipment market is sustainably higher and less volatile. Also, display is higher and for Applied, it's sustainably a better market because there are more technology inflections and because we're growing our served market. Second, Applied's position in the market is sustainably stronger. And we're executing better and better. And third, we're generating more free cash flow and returning the excess to our shareholders. Speaking of free cash flow, one of your own interesting note comparing Applied Materials to some of the top names in the industrial sector. Relative to the average of the companies, Applied has higher revenue and profit growth along with higher ROIC and free cash flow margins. Compared to these companies, I believe we're being discounted for being more cyclical even as we become demonstrably less cyclical. I believe that over time, we'll be viewed and valued in a new way. So thank you for your time today. And we look forward to seeing many of you in person over the next few weeks. Michael Sullivan Well, great. Thanks, Bob. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. A replay of the call is going to be available on the website beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. And we thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, you may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.
