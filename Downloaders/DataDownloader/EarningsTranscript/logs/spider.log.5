(NASDAQ: INTU ) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call May 23, 2017, 16:30 ET Executives Neil Williams - CFO and EVP Brad Smith - Chairman, CEO and President Jerome Natoli - VP, Corporate Finance and Treasurer Analysts Kasthuri Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Michael Nemeroff - Crédit Suisse Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Jesse Hulsing - Goldman Sachs Group Sanjit Singh - Morgan Stanley Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates Patrick Colville - Arete Research Services Yun Kim - The Benchmark Company Operator Good afternoon. My name is Brian and I will be the conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jerry Natoli, Intuit's Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Mr. Natoli? Jerome Natoli Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Conference Call. I'm here with Brad Smith, our Chairman and CEO; and Neil Williams, our CFO.  Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brad. Brad Smith All right. Thanks, Jerry and thanks to all of you for joining us. We're pleased with our performance in our third fiscal quarter. As you know, this is our largest quarter of the year and we successfully delivered strong financial results in a complicated tax season. Exiting the quarter, our Consumer Tax revenue was up 9% year-to-date and is on track to finish at the high end of our guidance range for the full fiscal year. We're also driving continued momentum in our Small Business franchise with QuickBooks Online subscriber growth accelerating to 59% and over 2.2 million subscribers which is above the upper end of the target we had established for the full fiscal year. As a result, we're raising our outlook for QBO subscribers to $2.3 million. We're raising our full year revenue guidance and we're tightening the EPS range to the high end. All in all, we're on track to deliver another good year. With that overview, let me click down into the drivers of our performance in the third quarter, beginning with our tax results. This tax season proved to be eventful from beginning to end, but with the late start to the tax filing compared to prior years, a renewed competitive environment and a free category, a new IRS requirement designed to reduce fraud. The combination of these factors were reflected in the 4 drivers of the tax business that we discussed with you on a regular basis. The first driver is overall growth in the number of tax returns filed with the IRS. The latest IRS data indicate that total returns are down slightly, below the 0% to 1% growth that we have forecasted. If this trend plays out for the remainder of the tax filing year, it will be the slowest growth in total tax return since the year 2013. The second driver is the percentage of returns filed using do-it-yourself software. To-date, DIY category share has grown about 0.2 points, less than the 1.2 points that we expected. With that said, DIY category growth once again outpaced the year-over-year decline in the assisted tax prep methods. The third driver is TurboTax's share within the do-it-yourself category. After strong share gains the past several years, our share with DIY e-file this season was flat. This performance is below the 1 point of share gain that we strive to achieve each year and we're already designing innovative ways to accelerate customer growth as we look ahead to next season. The fourth driver is revenue per return which has been stronger than our multiyear average of 1%. Our pricing was relatively stable this season so the benefit resulted from a mix shift to the higher end of our product lineup. So while the drivers of our tax results played out differently than expected, I am proud of the agile execution and innovation the team delivered this season. If you recall the game plan that we shared at our Investor Day in the fall, we outlined the plan to extend our leadership in do-it-yourself tax, began transforming the assisted tax category and ran experiments to evolve beyond tax through a tested open platform. This season, we made progress across several fronts. We leaned into SmartLook, providing broad access to an expert with the simple touch of a finger at a much lower cost than going to a tax store. We also began driving value to the broader Intuit ecosystem, leveraging the credit score functionality in Mint to provide more than 1.3 million free credit scores to TurboTax customers this season. And we introduced the Self-Employed bundle of QuickBooks and TurboTax, targeting the freelancer and gig economy, driving strong results which I'll discuss in greater detail in a minute. All of this was built on the investments we've made in innovation over the past several years in areas such as artificial intelligence where we applied for more than 100 patents and have more than 30 AI applications in market across the company. Putting the bill around Consumer Tax, we're exiting this season with strong financial results, although generated in ways that were different than what we'd expected. We'll learn from our experience this season and continue to invest in our multiyear strategy to deliver against the long term objectives that we set for ourselves. We'll share more details on our results and our long term strategy at our Annual Investor Day in the fall. With that overview on Consumer Tax, let's shift to the assisted tax result and ProConnect. This business delivered results that were better than our expectations with year-to-date revenue growth of 2%. ProConnect plays an important role across our ecosystem with approximately 60% of the TurboTax SmartLook agent being passed by our ProConnect tax experts in this season. We've also seen early success in driving QBO subscribers through our tax sales efforts, fostering growth within the QBO franchise. With that overview on tax, let me now shift to Small Business. Subscriber growth continued to accelerate, driven by improvement across our platform that serves self-employed, small businesses and accountants. We've also increased our marketing effectiveness and expanded our addressable footprint internationally in the self-employed segment. As I mentioned earlier, total QBO subscribers grew 59% in the quarter, up from 49% growth in the second quarter. Our TurboTax Self-Employed offering contributed 11 points to the subscriber growth.  We continue to drive strong growth in both our core U.S. business and international markets. Outside the U.S., our subscriber base grew 70% year-over-year to 433,000 subscribers. That's up from 61% growth in Q2. Within QuickBooks Online, the QuickBooks Self-Employed subscribers doubled to 360,000, up from 180,000 last quarter and 75,000 just one year ago. During Q3, we launched QuickBooks Self-Employed in Singapore, adding another geography to our lineup and we expect to launch in Hong Kong and South Africa soon. Finally, our TurboTax Self-Employed offering has contributed approximately 160,000 subscribers to the QuickBooks Self-Employed total so far this year. Our tax customer base is proving to be a great channel for reaching the self-employed and we know nearly 4 million TurboTax customers are self-employed tax filers. I'm also pleased to report that QuickBooks Self-Employed customers who come through the TurboTax channel have a higher product recommendation score as well. Our momentum in QBO subscriber growth is driving top line revenue with online ecosystem revenue growing 30% again this quarter, at the high end of our 25% to 30% target range. We expect online accounting to be the primary driver of online ecosystem revenue for the foreseeable future as we prioritize feeding the global market with QuickBooks Online. Add-on services such as payroll and payments, the blade to the QBO razor, certainly remain important and they'll play an increasingly larger role in later chapters, but our strategic priority at this time is getting more QBO razors in the market. This playbook should sound familiar because it served us well for decades in the QuickBooks Desktop franchises. Putting it all together, our strategy of a vibrant One Intuit Ecosystem is gaining real momentum. We're seeing proof points with more ecosystem connections between customers and products that are creating greater value for our customers and building sources and competitive advantage for Intuit. Whether it's TurboTax driving self-employed customers for QuickBooks, it's ProConnect accountants serving TurboTax customers through SmartLook or the Mint credit scores being delivered to TurboTax customers, we're unleashing the power of the many for the prosperity of one. You will hear more from us on this front in the coming months. But with that overview, I'm going to hand it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details. Neil Williams Thanks, Brad and good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $2.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year; GAAP operating income of $1.4 billion versus $1.3 billion a year ago; non-GAAP operating income of $1.5 billion versus $1.4 billion last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.70 versus $3.94 last year; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.90, up from $3.43 last year. As a reminder, our GAAP results last year included $0.68 per share from the sale of discontinued operations. Turning to the business segments. Consumer Tax revenue was up 10% in the quarter, 9% year-to-date. Our unit growth was 2% and we saw a mix shift in the higher end of our product lineup, increasing our average revenue per customer. We held share in the category this year, but we did not grow units faster than revenue. This is not consistent with our long term principle and we're addressing it in our strategy for next year. We've had questions on the difference between unit and e-file growth this season so let me explain. We grew units 2% this season, but our e-file growth was flat. New Internal Revenue Service security measures this tax year mandated the only way to e-file is to enter the prior year adjusted gross income or your existing filing pen. Many of our new customers had difficulty with this, causing them to print and mail their returns inside of e-filing. Although these returns were prepared with our software and customers paid for them, the mail returns are not included in e-file results reported by the IRS nor are they counted in our share calculations which are based on e-file returns. We saw at least an incremental 500,000 returns this year that were paid for, but not e-filed. ProConnect revenue was $168 million in Q3, down 8% from Q3 last year. This reflects the timing shifts from forms availability we discussed last quarter. Year-to-date, our ProConnect revenue was $327 million, a little better than our expectations and last year. Moving to Small Business. Total Small Business revenue grew 16% in the quarter. QuickBooks Online subscriber growth remained strong and we exceeded our guidance for the quarter and the full year, reaching 2,220,000 subscribers, up 59% year-over-year. TurboTax was a significant channel for QuickBooks Self-Employed in Q3, accounting for 11 points of growth. Small Business online ecosystem revenue grew 30% for the second consecutive quarter. This is at the high end of the 25% to 30% growth range we've talked about and is driven by continued growth of online accounting revenue. Our Online Payroll and payment businesses remained healthy, growing 19% and 9% this quarter, respectively. As we told you before, a portion of each of these businesses are attached to QuickBooks Online and a portion is made up of stand-alone customers who are not connected to QuickBooks.  Online Payroll revenue attached to QuickBooks makes up about 45% of Online Payroll revenue. That revenue grew 35% in the quarter, with subscriber growth of 21%. In contrast, Online Payroll revenue unattached to QuickBooks grew 1%. Online payments revenue attached to QuickBooks makes up about 60% of our online payments revenue. That revenue grew 33% in the quarter, with active payments customer growth up 47%. As we've mentioned in the past, we're not investing in acquiring stand-alone payments customers and that portion of the portfolio is declining. Revenue for these online payments customers not attached to QuickBooks fell 15%. Our Small Business desktop ecosystem revenue grew 12%. About 6 points of this revenue growth is related to a SKU we introduced at retail last year. This SKU gave desktop customers a QuickBooks license and the right to access QuickBooks Online service for one year at no additional charge. This required us to defer a portion of the related revenue. These rights expired in Q3, resulting in recognition of this revenue. Desktop units declined 15% year-over-year and units were 3% below last year on a year-to-date basis. For fiscal 2017, we expect QuickBooks Desktop units to decline mid-single digits and desktop ecosystem revenue to be up mid-single digits. That growth is driven by ratable revenue recognition and continued strength in our QuickBooks Enterprise business. Turning to our financial principles. We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment growth of 15%. With approximately $1.6 billion in cash and investments in our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for customer growth. Our goal is to drive double-digit revenue growth and to grow operating income in the mid-teens. We return excess cash to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately $90 million of shares in the third quarter and $1.9 billion remains on our authorization. We used some of our operating cash to repay $500 million in senior notes that matured in March and $150 million on our revolver. The board approved the dividend of 3 -- $0.34 per share payable on July 18, 2017. We're raising our full year QBO subscribers and total company revenue guidance and narrowing operating income and EPS to the high end of the range. We now expect total company revenue growth of 9% to 10% for the year. You can find our fiscal 2017 Q4 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close. Brad Smith Thank you, Neil. Q3 was another strong quarter for Intuit with a hard-fought tax season that brought some bright spots as well as opportunities to improve, but ultimately delivered at the high end of our revenue guidance for the tax business. Small Business continued to gain momentum with accelerating QBO subscriber growth leading to an increase in our full year subscriber outlook and online ecosystem revenue topping the high end of our 25% to 30% target range for the second consecutive quarter. Collectively, we're driving strong progress for the One Intuit Ecosystem strategy, creating greater value for our customers and building new sources of competitive advantage. So with that overview and summary, Brian, let's hand it back to you to hear what's on everybody's mind. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kasthuri Rangan It looks like this additional discovery that you had for 4 million self-employed individuals that are also TurboTax customers, how near term of an opportunity would this be to the QBO franchise as regards your ability to make this something of a bigger -- I know 2.2 million is fantastic. But at what point in time are we looking for and shooting for a 5 million type target which all the more, given your disclosure, looks feasible given the correlation and the data that you uncovered? Brad Smith Thank you, Kash. I love your optimism and your positive view on the business. We feel the same way about the opportunity with self-employed. We know that this is a secular trend that continues to build momentum around the globe. And we discovered in TurboTax, we do indeed have a channel with 4 million of those tax filers being self-employed and we discovered, now with the bundle, that this year was really the first full year having in that season that we know how to optimize that conversion and get more of those customers in the funnel. So we haven't put in the outlook out there yet. We'll talk more about fiscal year '18 in August. But like you, we see the real opportunity here and we think that this is just the early inning of what could be a long term growth driver for the company. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Crédit Suisse. Michael Nemeroff Just digging in a little bit on the tax season. A lot of your paid subscribers in the next year come from your free filers in the previous year. So I'm wondering what, if any, impact you think that the flat market share in 2017 is going to impact the 2018 tax season? Brad Smith Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. Let me start by saying that we do believe that we left opportunity on the table. We have very clear principles to grow our customers faster than our revenue and we want to continue to take share in the category. This year, we did not do either of those. We actually did not grow our customers faster than revenue when we held share. But I would also tell you that, that doesn't mean next year is not going to be a good year for us. If you go back to 2013, that was a year where we grew our units at about 3%. We stepped back. We took the lessons. We laid out a game plan. And in 2014, we grew units 9%, 3x. And I can assure you, we've got a highly motivated team. And as Neil would say, bad batch, not a bad recipe. So we're back to the cooking table and we're ready to do it again. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard Another tax question on -- on the SKU mix, is there any way you could give us a sense as to what your mix look like of -- the Free, the Deluxe, the Premier? Any color there? Is it -- was it a mix within those categories? Or did you actually see higher prices in certain categories that helped on the revenue per filing? Brad Smith Yes, Walter. Let me break it down a little bit. And I'll break it into a 60, 20 and 20 sort of bucketing for you. The reason why we're able to still grow revenue at the high end of the range, 9% year-to-date, while we grow unit 2%, that's primarily because of mix. 60% of that effect was the fact that we did not get as many free, free customers as we set out to do every year. And as I just mentioned in my prior response, we're going to sharpen our pencils and get back at that next year because we want to continue to grow the category and we want to continue to grow share. So by taking free, free out of the mix, that means that your average revenue per return or revenue per customer for the remainder is going to be higher. That takes me to the 20% tranche. And that 20% is we have continued to get more sophisticated in finding ways to add value to customers that they're willing to pay for. Some of those may be prior year free customers, some of those could be existing pay customers that they see value bundles that they think were worthy of them actually paying and that's helped us increase our revenue. And then, the third bucket is the higher end of the product line, in particular TurboTax Self-Employed. With that success we just talked about QuickBooks Self-Employed, there's a real winner there and that's the most expensive or the highest priced product in our product lineup. So when you put that all together, it was fewer free, free which we actually view as an execution opportunity. We continue to get better at creating value that customers are willing to pay for and we're also seeing some early success at the higher end of our product line which we think bodes well for the future. Walter Pritchard Got it. And then, just on -- for Neil, on the margin. So, I mean, I hear you talking about wanting to drive Small Business subscribers and you have a history of monetizing those over time which I'd agree. But I look at your margins in Small Business from Q1 to Q2 to Q3, they actually improved -- have improved every quarter here if I look year-over-year and you're showing some nice margin expansion in Q3 in Small Business over where you were last year. Is there something anomalous there? Or is that a -- are you able to kind of do both at once? Neil Williams No. I think we're trying to balance, Walter, to do both at once. We have opportunities to grow and expand by investing in the product and marketing, but those have to be in a positive NPV. And so at the midpoint of our range this year, we think we will see maybe 50 basis points of margin expansion which I think is a really good balance between funding the growth opportunities we could see in front of us and take advantage of those and being true to our financial principles. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs. Jesse Hulsing Yes. Brad, I think you mentioned or maybe it was Neil, the razor-razorblade model for QBO. And you've used that in your Small Business segment for decades now. I'm curious, when you look at self-employed, how do you see that evolving? How do you -- where do you see opportunity to drive incremental add-ons into that self-employed base which is -- which doubled quarter-over quarter and seems to be on pace pretty quickly to get to north of a million subscribers. I'm wondering what can you sell into those users that's incremental? And how do you see that business evolving? Brad Smith Yes. Thank you, Jesse. First of all, I would say that we don't need to sell anything else to a self-employed customer for that to be a great business. There's hundreds of millions of these prospects around the world. And as we look at that opportunity and even at our current price at roughly $10 a month to $120 a month with a low cost to acquire those customers, that is a very good and profitable business that could be substantial for the company. So with that said, we're discovering already they have additional problems to be solved that they're willing to pay us for if we solve them well. A great example is we added invoicing functionality into self-employed and that connects to payments. And the ability for us to have them actually send an invoice and get paid in a matter of 8 days versus 28 days is a real opportunity for us to have razor blade. Another example is the one we talked about earlier in the opening comments which is tax returns. The ability to have them do their self-employed, separating personal from business, management throughout the year and then come tax time, press a button and have it go into TurboTax or go to one of our accountants to do a credit return, that's also another razor blade. And we'll stay focused on other opportunities down the road, but by and large, the opportunity is getting more of these units and then solving additional problems, whether it's getting paid faster with an invoice or doing a tax return, those are the razor blades that are already emerging. And we're still on the very early innings. Jesse Hulsing Got that. And then, a quick follow-up on international which, again, was strong and accelerated. How are you feeling about where Brazil and France are? And are you looking at launching in any other geographies with QuickBooks Online? Brad Smith Yes. So we're proud of that momentum we're seeing. Obviously, the 3 countries that drove the bulk of that were Canada and the U.K. and Australia where we've got product market fit right coming out of the last summer and we've really been hitting the accelerator. Brazil was on track, looking good. We're feeling confident that as we head into the summer months that, that looks closer to flaking into that green light that we're looking for on product market fit. France is right on its heels and we're still in the investigator phase on how to really figure out India. The good news is there's changes in India with GST which is basically a new tax legislation that will drive more compliance. And so our teams are really rolling up their sleeves to take advantage of that. In terms of additional countries, we're leading now with QuickBooks Self-Employed. We have found that to be the fastest, lightweight, easy to get into market and solve a problem and build a base. So I just mentioned that we introduced QuickBooks Self-Employed in Singapore in the last quarter and we're going to be introducing it in Hong Kong and South Africa soon. And then, from there, we'll talk about, in the fall, whether we see other countries that we'll take QBO to. But right now, self-employed will be the point of the sphere. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Sanjit Singh This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Just another sort of question on the tax business. If you sort of give us a sense sort of behind the scenes, as you saw the tax season progress, were there certain initiatives that you guys put in place? And if so, if we think through into next year, is this a situation where you guys have so much flexibility, given the strong franchise in tax, that you guys can sort of toggle strategies in the middle of the tax season? Brad Smith Yes. Behind the scenes, you might imagine, is a lot of scenario planning and a lot of adjusting on the fly. It's a highly instrumented business. We're able to see, at any moment in time, how many people are in the product versus the same minute of the same day last year and then our teams are able to look at that and say, okay, do we need to adjust anything as we look ahead? We made adjustments throughout the season. I think we talked about it a little bit just on our last call. We had put some investment in advertising early in the season. And then, when we saw the delays to the tax filing, we had to go ahead and belly up to the bar and put a little more money into what we would typically think of as the trough which is after the season gets started, there's a little bit of a lull before the back half procrastinators jump in. But we advertised through the trough this year because we simply were going to have to come at some point and that paid off for us. In terms of next year, I'll say this. We don't take anything for granted. We're telling you now, we know there are things we could have done differently and better. And the neat thing about this business is we'll step back and we'll sharpen our pencils there and we'll lay out our game plan and we'll be ready for next year. And I anticipate another very competitive season next year, but I think this year demonstrates we have the ability to adjust, make the right calls and deliver the results that we're promising. So that's what we're looking forward to. Sanjit Singh Great. And then, one quick follow-up just on mark-to-market on the Desktop business. You guys guided that's going to be down mid-single digits. Any sort of update on whether those desktop customers are making the shift to QBO? Was it still in line with what we've seen over the last couple of years? Brad Smith Yes. It's a little bit faster, but let me give you some context. I am excited to tell you now that if customers that are coming in to the QBO franchise, QuickBooks Online, if you throw in self-employed, it's now over 90% are new to the Intuit franchise. And so that is an acceleration of even getting further category expansion and people into our business for the first time. And then, if you look at the desktop, we have, through 3 quarters now, 132,000 people who've migrated from desktop to QBO. That's up about 25% year-over-year. And so we basically done in 3 quarters what we did in 4 quarters last year, but that's not driving the bulk of this growth. 90% of these customers are new to the franchise which is exactly what we wanted. That's driving our overall active base and it's enabling us to capitalize on this TAM. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta Brad, I wanted to get your perspective a little bit on the tax business. If you look this year, there wasn't as much growth in the DIY category. And I'm wondering if, going forward, you anticipate any changes or if you think this was an anomaly? Brad Smith Yes, Kartik. I would say, first of all, we take the responsibility, as the champion of the do-it-yourself category, to grow the category. We have a 65 share. And I believe, this year, a combination of things. There was a little bit of funkiness in the overall tax season that everyone is still seeking to explain and no one yet has answers, including the IRS. So we'll have to sort through that. And then, this year, we definitely leaned our advertising and marketing more into the transform-assisted strategy which is showing people they would never be alone. And with SmartLook, you would have access to an expert. And that certainly played out well for what we wanted to do, but I'm not sure that, that succeeded in helping us expand the DIY category at large. And so we'll step back and take responsibility of what can we do to continue to accelerate that growth. What we do know is we've got secular tailwinds. And the secular tailwinds are showing that DIY is still growing faster than the assisted methods and we just have to find ways to continue to accelerate that secular trend. And we will do that as we look to next year. Kartik Mehta And then finally, Brad, this year, we saw some aggressive competition on the DIY side from a product standpoint and what people were willing -- companies were willing to offer. Now how do you see this changing the landscape of the industry over the next couple of years? Brad Smith Yes, Kartik, I think it will actually tie to your prior question. This is good news for the category. As you know, we've had lots of very good competition across many of our franchises over the years and every time a new competitor comes in, especially one that is well funded and they're aggressive in advertising and in pricing, that tends to accelerate the category growth because it gets more people and other masses to raise their head and get out of spreadsheets or come out of stores and say, wow, there might be a better way to do this. So I believe you saw the early days of what hopefully is going to be a continuing advertising and marketing message that says there is a much better way to get your taxes done. And if we didn't do what we know we have to do, have the best product and have the cleanest value prop, I think that's going to be good news for the category and good news for us. So I anticipate a continuation of this year's ultra-aggressive competition and I think that's a good thing for consumers and I think it's a good thing for the category. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow Two quick questions. First of all, Brad, a couple of years ago, when we talked about QuickBooks Online and the QuickBooks full category, we always said there's a big, wide greenfield opportunity. 40% of guys are still doing it in Excel, et cetera, et cetera. And I'm going back to quite a few years now. How do you think, if you look at the self-employed category, are those the guys that kind of you were talking about back then? Or is this kind of like because of the change in the economy, like a whole new growing kind of way that is coming our way? That's the first question. And then one for Neil quickly. Any update on 606, with that coming obviously soon at some point? Brad Smith Yes. Thanks, Raimo. We'll divide and conquer on this. So let me start with the first one on the number of small businesses that are still not in the accounting software category. They're using spreadsheets, shoeboxes, ink pens and checks and that number is still, believe it or not, 42%. And it is equal to not only those that are self-employed, but those that clearly could be in QuickBooks Online. In fact, in the U.S., the number of people who are ripe for QuickBooks Online are about 20 million and we have 1.8 million of them today. So there's a huge opportunity for us to show that there's a better way and that's why we're starting to lean in with more advertising and more category awareness in addition to working with accountants. So still a lot of greenfield and that represents itself, not only in the U.S., but all the countries we're going through around the globe. Let me hand it over to Neil to talk about 606. Neil Williams Sure, Raimo. We've been working on this for quite some time. But for us, 606 won't be applicable until our fiscal year 2019 and based on what we've seen so far in our analysis, so it's really not incentive for us to adopt early. We can't really say, at this point, what the impact will be on our financial results because we haven't completed the analysis and work with our external accounting firm. But you can just remember that the desktop products we have are declining as a percentage of our total revenue and the percentage of those desktop products that involve a long term contract or long term commitment is even smaller than that. So we'll keep you posted, but just remember, for us, it's probably a fiscal year 2019 issue and we'll keep you updated as we move along. Operator Our next question will come from Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Ross MacMillan I had two questions, Brad. First, on tax, was there any price mix benefit this year from your traditional raising of prices as you move through the season? I wondered if that happened any earlier this season and whether that was a contributor to the price mix. And related to that, I wondered if there was any comment on non-kind of core revenues, such as audit insurance or fraud protection fees or other avenues of revenue generation that you might be starting to see. And then I have a quick follow-up. Brad Smith Okay. Thanks, Ross. The answer to your first question is no. We really did not have any material changes in pricing or even the timing of pricing that would have affected the results the way that we're talking about here. In terms of the noncore revenue, I think is the question, we have created value bundles and we marketed those this year, bundles that include, we call them, Flots and other kinds of bundles that have things like fraud, audit defense and the ability to make sure that if anything happened, we had the ability for you to go in and keep an eye on your credit card and your credit reports. Those value-added bundles, they were ways that we were able to basically continue to help customers see value and pay for it. But there wasn't anything that jumped out that was meaningfully different than any prior year trends, to be honest with you. You said you had another question after that? Ross MacMillan Just one for Neil or maybe Jerry. Just a clarification that when we look at the QuickBooks Online subscribers and we look at 360,000 self-employed, 433,000 international, are those mutually exclusive? Or if some of the international include self-employed and if so, do you have a sense of how much? Jerome Natoli Yes, Ross, some of those international subs do include QuickBooks Self-Employed. We've had self-employed out there in the U.K. and in Australia now and in Canada, that we've just launched, as Brad said, a minute ago. We haven't broken out that specific number for QuickBooks Self-Employed within the 433,000 international. It's a pretty small fraction at this point, yes. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger Brad, could you comment? We haven't heard a lot about fraud this year. And obviously, the -- some of the late start to the year was probably related to some IRS changes and I know you're not going to share your strategies for next year at this juncture. But what are you hearing and seeing out of the IRS for how the tax season may start next year? And then again, circling back to that fraud discussion and what you saw year-over-year, just as an industry perspective. Brad Smith Yes, Scott, I would say what we saw was incredibly encouraging. The industry once again locked arms, not only the do-it-yourself industry, the professional tax preparers and the banking industry as well as the IRS in the federal and then the state level too. And I think we all feel like we continue to push the ball forward in terms of getting the bad guys out of the system. We won't know the dimensions of how much we were able to do until the IRS comes out and reports that out in late summer, early fall.  But everyone of us collectively believe that we continue to advance the cause and we're going to stay at this. It's going to be a multiyear ongoing effort until we get every cybercriminal out of the system that we can. So that's sort of bucket 1. Now what are the impacts to next year? There are a lot of things this season that everyone's still processing, things that we ended up requiring tax filers to do. Next year, we hope to be able to do with less friction and one of them was the one that Neil mentioned in his opening comments which is in an effort to try to ensure we got cybercriminals out, if you did not know your prior year adjusted gross income or you didn't know you tax filing PIN, then you were able to process your return using our software, but then you had to print it out and mail it. You could not e-file it without those 2 pieces of information. And that ended up, in our case, with about 500,000 people who were able to do their taxes in TurboTax but had to put it in an envelope and send it into the IRS. So I think next year, industry and the IRS in the States will say is that the experience we want to continue or is there something we can do that's just as equally protective but less friction for the taxpayer. But right now, it's too early to know what those are. We'll work those over the summer and talk to you about them in the fall when we do our Investor Day. Scott Schneeberger All right. And then just following up, Neil and you may have already covered it in your discussion of return of capital, but year-to-date, a little bit lighter than would have been expected, I think, on share repurchases. I realize there were some debt reduction going on in this recent quarter. But is there any -- yes, well, in response to share count for the full year, any change to that outlook or any catch-up anticipated back to prior year levels? And you may not want to address this year because it's near term, but how should we think about share repurchase going out on a run rate a few years out? Neil Williams Yes, Scott, I would tell you that I think Q3 is a bit of an anomaly. As you mentioned, we did have those senior notes that were due in March. And so we had some cash we allocated to debt reduction. And frankly, the matrix we had in our 10b5 also was a little more conservative at higher stock prices. So we didn't buy as many shares and at some of the higher price points at times, during the quarter, when we had to be out in the market for other reasons. So our stock repurchase plan has worked really great for us and so I would view Q3 being more of an anomaly than a trend going forward. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne Brad, I think in your prepared comments, you mentioned that there was about 11% contribution from TurboTax on the QBO business. And I was wondering if you could just sort of comment on was that about as expected. Was it better than you thought? I'm just trying to get a sense on, yes, you guys obviously were expecting some contribution from TurboTax to QBO. Did that outperform and I guess if there was any specific reason why when you look back at the strength in the quarter in QBO subs? Brad Smith Yes. Thanks, Kirk. So you're referring to the 11 points of QuickBooks Online growth that we got from TurboTax Self-Employed, sending customers over. That was healthy. We had aspirations that we thought would be very positive. I've got to tell you that we were delighted and surprised that we saw the strength in the TurboTax channel feeding QuickBooks Self-Employed which gives us even more reason to lean in more aggressively next year. And so I would say that we did not have 11 points modeled in, at the same time, we'll take it and we're going to say how do we blow on that ember and turn it into a raging fire as we look at next year. Kirk Materne And if I could ask just one quick follow-up. I assume, when you're getting benefits from the TurboTax channel, that tends to be more disproportionate in the U.S. -- on the U.S. QBO business than on the international, just based on sort of where your channel space is right now. Is that fair? Brad Smith It is. We have TurboTax in the U.S. and Canada. So we'll have the ability to pass into that channel that way. But we're also working with QuickBooks Self-Employed in all the other countries to say it doesn't have to go to an Intuit tax product, they can see it in accountants. And as a result, accountants will recommend QuickBooks Self-Employed to get more tax customers. So think about this being a strategy that works everywhere. It just may not go into TurboTax like it does in the U.S. and Canada. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. James MacDonald Just following up on Scott's question on fraud. Do you think that affected the unit growth in the market as a whole and maybe will affect unit growth in future years? Brad Smith Yes, Jim, I really wish I knew the explanation on the unit growth at the IRS level. We can go back to 2013, where the industry really lined up and everyone got aggressive and we were all trying to get security beefed up and kind of get cybercriminals out. And in 2014, we actually saw the IRS return to grow over 1%. So even though we took a big bite of the apple then, it didn't slow down total tax returns. Now we continue to get better and better each year. So I really can't tell you and we're trying to hesitate to put out other hypotheses because I probably heard a half a dozen myself just having conversations. I think we'll have to wait and see what the IRS comes out with and then we'll be able to compare their data with ours and we will be as transparent as possible at Investor Day of what we think ultimately led to this very unusual tax filing season with the IRS. James MacDonald Okay. Great. And just a quick follow-up. You haven't given a number, but is it proper math to say if you grew TurboTax units -- revenue 9% and units 2%, that the price mix impact was 7%? Or is that incorrect math? Brad Smith You know what, that math works for me. Coming from where I come from, that's exactly the way we calculated it too. James MacDonald Okay. Just trying to figure out if units had a bigger impact in some way, shape or form. Brad Smith No, you actually got it. We looked at -- we actually broke it down and looked at the revenue per return and it's roughly 7% as well. And it was driven by that 60-20-20 mix I mentioned a little while ago. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman Well, just quickly following up on your -- on the last question. To what extent did the 500,000 returns that didn't get counted as do-it-yourself get counted however in tax, in your tax revenue? And then I have several more. Brad Smith Yes, Michael. So let me take this one then and then we'll get back to your other ones. That 500,000, they ended up processing using our product and paying that. So that's in that revenue per return. But then when they showed up at the IRS, the IRS counted them as paper because they showed up in an envelope and not coming through on e-file. So if you had to throw those 500,000 back into the mix which is why you heard Neil say that those don't show up in the IRS category growth numbers and they don't show up in our share counts because we always compare our stuff against the IRS. But there's 500,000 that we did get paid for, so that shows up in our revenue, but it doesn't necessarily show up when the IRS prints its numbers and says, whoa, paper grew for the first time in a few years while it was because people processed with software and then had to mail it in because they didn't know their PIN. Michael Millman Okay. So it would suggest that the 7% that you just talked about, increase in price, really, that doesn't particularly jive with what you just said about increased number of returns... Brad Smith I'm sorry, yes. We're not tracking the same way. Go ahead, Neil. Neil Williams The 500,000, Michael, are in our unit number that we disclosed that we said was up 2%. Michael Millman Oh, so they are in your numbers. Neil Williams They're in our unit numbers... Brad Smith Yes, we're talking two different things here, Michael. I'm sorry, we're talking units which we said were up 2%. E-files which are ultimately the IRS when you receive those and then they count those as were those paper or software, that's where the numbers get a little bit out of sorts. But our numbers are 2% unit growth, 9% year-to-date revenue growth and the average revenue per unit went up about 7% and that was the math that Jim was just asking about a few minutes ago as well. Michael Millman Okay. So it does seem, when you look at your numbers down from up 15% to 2%, the IRS 5 7 down to kind of 0.2, that it was a bigger -- you had a bigger effect than the IRS and leads to sort of the next question, is that you indicated that you were affected at the low end or the free end. And so I kind of wonder, to what extent that, that was blocked doing many more free but also increasing but free, covered, would seem to hurt your potential complexity. I was kind of also interested in the effect of Comer which a lot of people talked about, but maybe you can give us some numbers on it. And then the other side of the coin is TaxACT going the other way. And we see that as having some impact on the industry. Brad Smith Okay, Michael. So let me try to parse that and I'll say that I think it was the collective competitive environment with all the names that you mentioned, including us, that led to a little more of an even distribution of who got the free, free customers. And over the last several years, we were out there pretty much alone with the Absolute Zero program. And this year, everyone dove in and decided they wanted a piece of that pie. Now it happened to coincide with the fact that after 3 years of that being our main message, we chose to pivot our broadcast, our TV advertising to more SmartLook which was the assisted -- transform assisted. So we sort of went dark in terms of broadcast media. On the free message, we still had that in digital. And they all came out with TV ads. And so I think that's why we allowed ourselves to kind of let some of this free, free customers to go elsewhere. And suffice it to say, regardless of whether it was the competitors you named or others, we don't plan to play the game the same way next year. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Patrick Colville with Arete Research. Patrick Colville Can you help me understand the acceleration in self-employed? So I mean, judging by the other questions asked in the call, it's clear that was just an inflection in growth in the U.S. So what was the cause of that inflection? Brad Smith Yes, so Patrick, it's a combination of things. First of all, there's just a secular trend of the gig economy. It's now estimated to be about 34% of the workforce and expected to be 43% by the year 2020. And these individuals have complexity to have to separate their personal business expense and then in the case of the United States, they have to follow Schedule C. And so ultimately, when you put that together, you say there's a lot more of them. We've been signing partnerships with Uber, Lyft, TaskRabbit, DoorDash, you name it, we've got all kinds of partnerships out there. And we've been working aggressively with the accountant channel because for the accountants, these are some of the hardest customers to serve because they don't have their steps sorted out, they come in at tax time and it's really laborious for the accountant to get the stuff all separated. So the accountants and the partnerships have been driving it. And then the second thing is we have 60 million people who come to QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks.com every year. That is a huge funnel. And now by introducing this as one of the product lineup SKUs, we're able to capitalize on our own web traffic and convert those into customers. The last piece I would say is 2 parts. One is new channels and one was TurboTax.com which added 160,000 QuickBooks Self-Employed units in the last quarter. And the other was new geographies, where we just introduced it in Singapore and we'll be opening up to other countries as well. So I'll put a bow around it and say, secular trends, we have channels with accountants and our own web marketing and partnerships like with Uber that are growing the core business. You add to that the opportunity to go with TurboTax as a channel and then open new geographies and we think self-employed has a lot of opportunity for growth as we look ahead. Patrick Colville Got it. And can I just quickly follow up. So do you think this, the self-employed, is expanding the category? Or is there some, a small amount of cannibalization at the low end of kind of the desktop products? Brad Smith I am so happy you asked that question. I have been dying to share this data. I had truly been waiting. I was even going to add it to my closing comments if no one asked. So over the last several quarters, actually, for the last couple of years, we've been talking about what percent of customers are new to the franchise coming into QuickBooks and then what percent of new customers are choosing an online version versus desktop. We used to say 80% of all the customers coming into QBO were new to the franchise. Well, now with self-employed, it moved above 90%. The other thing is, now when you have a customer going to our website and saying, do I want the desktop version or online, we now have over 80% of them choosing an online version of the product, whether it's self-employed or QBO. That was 70% just a quarter ago and it was just in the 60s 12 months ago. So this is expanding the category. And what's that mean? If you count the number of customers who bought one of our products and paid for it in the last 12 months, that total paying customer base is up 40% and that's up from 34% just 90 days ago. So it is expanding the category with some pretty exciting opportunities ahead of us. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Yun Kim with Benchmark. Yun Kim Can you just talk about what are -- what you are thinking about the overall ASP headwind that you are obviously experiencing in some level as your self-employed mix becomes larger and larger? If I did my math right, I think about half of the new QBO subs -- sub-adds in the quarter was given by self-employed. Obviously, given the opportunity to aggressively add new QBO subs, especially around self-employed subs, what are some of the parameters and metrics that you are monitoring or using to ensure some cost discipline around the QBO acquisition cost? Brad Smith Sure, thank you. First of all, I would say, this is why we've tried to articulate the 2 things that we measure inside and we talk about in our operating reviews and with our board and it is growing the subscriber base north of 40% and growing the total online ecosystem revenue 25% to 30%. And we just posted 59% on the first number and we just posted the second consecutive quarter of online ecosystem revenue growing at 30%. So it's the high end of that 25% to 30%. The second point I would say is, our emphasis right now is razors, not blades. Whether it's self-employed going after the hundreds of millions around the world at the point of the spear or it's QuickBooks Online, where we're trying to continue to accelerate and get new customers into the franchise and out of spreadsheets, that is our absolute top priority.  And as you can see, that is driving online ecosystem revenue growth, where we're at the high end of the range at 30% 2 quarters in a row. In terms of the discipline, Neil referred to this a few minutes ago when we were asked about the margins continuing to expand even while we're in a pretty heavy investment mode to expanding to new countries. And that's because we watch LTV to CAC, the lifetime value divided by the cost to acquire a customer. And every country has a target and as you know, we've collectively been driving our LTV to CAC. If you look at QBO across the globe, it's around 5.5. 5.5. And if you throw in desktop, it's about 6.9. So we're maintaining that discipline. But we're focused on the razors, whether it's self-employed or it's QBO. We'ren't worried about whether one is $10 a month or one is $24 a month because we focus on LTV to CAC to make sure we have the right discipline and cost to acquire and that's driving overall revenue growth and margin expansion. Yun Kim Okay. Great. Real quick on the tax business. It's just a quick fundamental question, Brad. Are you still committed to going after the new taxpayers coming into the market, even if this means that there could be some incremental margin headwind to get those customers given the increasing competition for those customers? Brad Smith Yes. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad Smith Sure, Brian, I'll keep it short. Well, we want to thank everybody for the questions today. Obviously, we're feeling good with the quarter. More importantly, we feel like we have momentum that we're building as we enter the fourth quarter and we have some important lessons learned that will sharpen our thinking as we look ahead to next year. So looking forward to catching up with you soon. And with that, thanks for the time this afternoon. Take care. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

Our first question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kasthuri Rangan It looks like this additional discovery that you had for 4 million self-employed individuals that are also TurboTax customers, how near term of an opportunity would this be to the QBO franchise as regards your ability to make this something of a bigger -- I know 2.2 million is fantastic. But at what point in time are we looking for and shooting for a 5 million type target which all the more, given your disclosure, looks feasible given the correlation and the data that you uncovered? Brad Smith Thank you, Kash. I love your optimism and your positive view on the business. We feel the same way about the opportunity with self-employed. We know that this is a secular trend that continues to build momentum around the globe. And we discovered in TurboTax, we do indeed have a channel with 4 million of those tax filers being self-employed and we discovered, now with the bundle, that this year was really the first full year having in that season that we know how to optimize that conversion and get more of those customers in the funnel. So we haven't put in the outlook out there yet. We'll talk more about fiscal year '18 in August. But like you, we see the real opportunity here and we think that this is just the early inning of what could be a long term growth driver for the company. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Crédit Suisse. Michael Nemeroff Just digging in a little bit on the tax season. A lot of your paid subscribers in the next year come from your free filers in the previous year. So I'm wondering what, if any, impact you think that the flat market share in 2017 is going to impact the 2018 tax season? Brad Smith Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. Let me start by saying that we do believe that we left opportunity on the table. We have very clear principles to grow our customers faster than our revenue and we want to continue to take share in the category. This year, we did not do either of those. We actually did not grow our customers faster than revenue when we held share. But I would also tell you that, that doesn't mean next year is not going to be a good year for us. If you go back to 2013, that was a year where we grew our units at about 3%. We stepped back. We took the lessons. We laid out a game plan. And in 2014, we grew units 9%, 3x. And I can assure you, we've got a highly motivated team. And as Neil would say, bad batch, not a bad recipe. So we're back to the cooking table and we're ready to do it again. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard Another tax question on -- on the SKU mix, is there any way you could give us a sense as to what your mix look like of -- the Free, the Deluxe, the Premier? Any color there? Is it -- was it a mix within those categories? Or did you actually see higher prices in certain categories that helped on the revenue per filing? Brad Smith Yes, Walter. Let me break it down a little bit. And I'll break it into a 60, 20 and 20 sort of bucketing for you. The reason why we're able to still grow revenue at the high end of the range, 9% year-to-date, while we grow unit 2%, that's primarily because of mix. 60% of that effect was the fact that we did not get as many free, free customers as we set out to do every year. And as I just mentioned in my prior response, we're going to sharpen our pencils and get back at that next year because we want to continue to grow the category and we want to continue to grow share. So by taking free, free out of the mix, that means that your average revenue per return or revenue per customer for the remainder is going to be higher. That takes me to the 20% tranche. And that 20% is we have continued to get more sophisticated in finding ways to add value to customers that they're willing to pay for. Some of those may be prior year free customers, some of those could be existing pay customers that they see value bundles that they think were worthy of them actually paying and that's helped us increase our revenue. And then, the third bucket is the higher end of the product line, in particular TurboTax Self-Employed. With that success we just talked about QuickBooks Self-Employed, there's a real winner there and that's the most expensive or the highest priced product in our product lineup. So when you put that all together, it was fewer free, free which we actually view as an execution opportunity. We continue to get better at creating value that customers are willing to pay for and we're also seeing some early success at the higher end of our product line which we think bodes well for the future. Walter Pritchard Got it. And then, just on -- for Neil, on the margin. So, I mean, I hear you talking about wanting to drive Small Business subscribers and you have a history of monetizing those over time which I'd agree. But I look at your margins in Small Business from Q1 to Q2 to Q3, they actually improved -- have improved every quarter here if I look year-over-year and you're showing some nice margin expansion in Q3 in Small Business over where you were last year. Is there something anomalous there? Or is that a -- are you able to kind of do both at once? Neil Williams No. I think we're trying to balance, Walter, to do both at once. We have opportunities to grow and expand by investing in the product and marketing, but those have to be in a positive NPV. And so at the midpoint of our range this year, we think we will see maybe 50 basis points of margin expansion which I think is a really good balance between funding the growth opportunities we could see in front of us and take advantage of those and being true to our financial principles. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs. Jesse Hulsing Yes. Brad, I think you mentioned or maybe it was Neil, the razor-razorblade model for QBO. And you've used that in your Small Business segment for decades now. I'm curious, when you look at self-employed, how do you see that evolving? How do you -- where do you see opportunity to drive incremental add-ons into that self-employed base which is -- which doubled quarter-over quarter and seems to be on pace pretty quickly to get to north of a million subscribers. I'm wondering what can you sell into those users that's incremental? And how do you see that business evolving? Brad Smith Yes. Thank you, Jesse. First of all, I would say that we don't need to sell anything else to a self-employed customer for that to be a great business. There's hundreds of millions of these prospects around the world. And as we look at that opportunity and even at our current price at roughly $10 a month to $120 a month with a low cost to acquire those customers, that is a very good and profitable business that could be substantial for the company. So with that said, we're discovering already they have additional problems to be solved that they're willing to pay us for if we solve them well. A great example is we added invoicing functionality into self-employed and that connects to payments. And the ability for us to have them actually send an invoice and get paid in a matter of 8 days versus 28 days is a real opportunity for us to have razor blade. Another example is the one we talked about earlier in the opening comments which is tax returns. The ability to have them do their self-employed, separating personal from business, management throughout the year and then come tax time, press a button and have it go into TurboTax or go to one of our accountants to do a credit return, that's also another razor blade. And we'll stay focused on other opportunities down the road, but by and large, the opportunity is getting more of these units and then solving additional problems, whether it's getting paid faster with an invoice or doing a tax return, those are the razor blades that are already emerging. And we're still on the very early innings. Jesse Hulsing Got that. And then, a quick follow-up on international which, again, was strong and accelerated. How are you feeling about where Brazil and France are? And are you looking at launching in any other geographies with QuickBooks Online? Brad Smith Yes. So we're proud of that momentum we're seeing. Obviously, the 3 countries that drove the bulk of that were Canada and the U.K. and Australia where we've got product market fit right coming out of the last summer and we've really been hitting the accelerator. Brazil was on track, looking good. We're feeling confident that as we head into the summer months that, that looks closer to flaking into that green light that we're looking for on product market fit. France is right on its heels and we're still in the investigator phase on how to really figure out India. The good news is there's changes in India with GST which is basically a new tax legislation that will drive more compliance. And so our teams are really rolling up their sleeves to take advantage of that. In terms of additional countries, we're leading now with QuickBooks Self-Employed. We have found that to be the fastest, lightweight, easy to get into market and solve a problem and build a base. So I just mentioned that we introduced QuickBooks Self-Employed in Singapore in the last quarter and we're going to be introducing it in Hong Kong and South Africa soon. And then, from there, we'll talk about, in the fall, whether we see other countries that we'll take QBO to. But right now, self-employed will be the point of the sphere. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Sanjit Singh This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Just another sort of question on the tax business. If you sort of give us a sense sort of behind the scenes, as you saw the tax season progress, were there certain initiatives that you guys put in place? And if so, if we think through into next year, is this a situation where you guys have so much flexibility, given the strong franchise in tax, that you guys can sort of toggle strategies in the middle of the tax season? Brad Smith Yes. Behind the scenes, you might imagine, is a lot of scenario planning and a lot of adjusting on the fly. It's a highly instrumented business. We're able to see, at any moment in time, how many people are in the product versus the same minute of the same day last year and then our teams are able to look at that and say, okay, do we need to adjust anything as we look ahead? We made adjustments throughout the season. I think we talked about it a little bit just on our last call. We had put some investment in advertising early in the season. And then, when we saw the delays to the tax filing, we had to go ahead and belly up to the bar and put a little more money into what we would typically think of as the trough which is after the season gets started, there's a little bit of a lull before the back half procrastinators jump in. But we advertised through the trough this year because we simply were going to have to come at some point and that paid off for us. In terms of next year, I'll say this. We don't take anything for granted. We're telling you now, we know there are things we could have done differently and better. And the neat thing about this business is we'll step back and we'll sharpen our pencils there and we'll lay out our game plan and we'll be ready for next year. And I anticipate another very competitive season next year, but I think this year demonstrates we have the ability to adjust, make the right calls and deliver the results that we're promising. So that's what we're looking forward to. Sanjit Singh Great. And then, one quick follow-up just on mark-to-market on the Desktop business. You guys guided that's going to be down mid-single digits. Any sort of update on whether those desktop customers are making the shift to QBO? Was it still in line with what we've seen over the last couple of years? Brad Smith Yes. It's a little bit faster, but let me give you some context. I am excited to tell you now that if customers that are coming in to the QBO franchise, QuickBooks Online, if you throw in self-employed, it's now over 90% are new to the Intuit franchise. And so that is an acceleration of even getting further category expansion and people into our business for the first time. And then, if you look at the desktop, we have, through 3 quarters now, 132,000 people who've migrated from desktop to QBO. That's up about 25% year-over-year. And so we basically done in 3 quarters what we did in 4 quarters last year, but that's not driving the bulk of this growth. 90% of these customers are new to the franchise which is exactly what we wanted. That's driving our overall active base and it's enabling us to capitalize on this TAM. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta Brad, I wanted to get your perspective a little bit on the tax business. If you look this year, there wasn't as much growth in the DIY category. And I'm wondering if, going forward, you anticipate any changes or if you think this was an anomaly? Brad Smith Yes, Kartik. I would say, first of all, we take the responsibility, as the champion of the do-it-yourself category, to grow the category. We have a 65 share. And I believe, this year, a combination of things. There was a little bit of funkiness in the overall tax season that everyone is still seeking to explain and no one yet has answers, including the IRS. So we'll have to sort through that. And then, this year, we definitely leaned our advertising and marketing more into the transform-assisted strategy which is showing people they would never be alone. And with SmartLook, you would have access to an expert. And that certainly played out well for what we wanted to do, but I'm not sure that, that succeeded in helping us expand the DIY category at large. And so we'll step back and take responsibility of what can we do to continue to accelerate that growth. What we do know is we've got secular tailwinds. And the secular tailwinds are showing that DIY is still growing faster than the assisted methods and we just have to find ways to continue to accelerate that secular trend. And we will do that as we look to next year. Kartik Mehta And then finally, Brad, this year, we saw some aggressive competition on the DIY side from a product standpoint and what people were willing -- companies were willing to offer. Now how do you see this changing the landscape of the industry over the next couple of years? Brad Smith Yes, Kartik, I think it will actually tie to your prior question. This is good news for the category. As you know, we've had lots of very good competition across many of our franchises over the years and every time a new competitor comes in, especially one that is well funded and they're aggressive in advertising and in pricing, that tends to accelerate the category growth because it gets more people and other masses to raise their head and get out of spreadsheets or come out of stores and say, wow, there might be a better way to do this. So I believe you saw the early days of what hopefully is going to be a continuing advertising and marketing message that says there is a much better way to get your taxes done. And if we didn't do what we know we have to do, have the best product and have the cleanest value prop, I think that's going to be good news for the category and good news for us. So I anticipate a continuation of this year's ultra-aggressive competition and I think that's a good thing for consumers and I think it's a good thing for the category. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow Two quick questions. First of all, Brad, a couple of years ago, when we talked about QuickBooks Online and the QuickBooks full category, we always said there's a big, wide greenfield opportunity. 40% of guys are still doing it in Excel, et cetera, et cetera. And I'm going back to quite a few years now. How do you think, if you look at the self-employed category, are those the guys that kind of you were talking about back then? Or is this kind of like because of the change in the economy, like a whole new growing kind of way that is coming our way? That's the first question. And then one for Neil quickly. Any update on 606, with that coming obviously soon at some point? Brad Smith Yes. Thanks, Raimo. We'll divide and conquer on this. So let me start with the first one on the number of small businesses that are still not in the accounting software category. They're using spreadsheets, shoeboxes, ink pens and checks and that number is still, believe it or not, 42%. And it is equal to not only those that are self-employed, but those that clearly could be in QuickBooks Online. In fact, in the U.S., the number of people who are ripe for QuickBooks Online are about 20 million and we have 1.8 million of them today. So there's a huge opportunity for us to show that there's a better way and that's why we're starting to lean in with more advertising and more category awareness in addition to working with accountants. So still a lot of greenfield and that represents itself, not only in the U.S., but all the countries we're going through around the globe. Let me hand it over to Neil to talk about 606. Neil Williams Sure, Raimo. We've been working on this for quite some time. But for us, 606 won't be applicable until our fiscal year 2019 and based on what we've seen so far in our analysis, so it's really not incentive for us to adopt early. We can't really say, at this point, what the impact will be on our financial results because we haven't completed the analysis and work with our external accounting firm. But you can just remember that the desktop products we have are declining as a percentage of our total revenue and the percentage of those desktop products that involve a long term contract or long term commitment is even smaller than that. So we'll keep you posted, but just remember, for us, it's probably a fiscal year 2019 issue and we'll keep you updated as we move along. Operator Our next question will come from Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Ross MacMillan I had two questions, Brad. First, on tax, was there any price mix benefit this year from your traditional raising of prices as you move through the season? I wondered if that happened any earlier this season and whether that was a contributor to the price mix. And related to that, I wondered if there was any comment on non-kind of core revenues, such as audit insurance or fraud protection fees or other avenues of revenue generation that you might be starting to see. And then I have a quick follow-up. Brad Smith Okay. Thanks, Ross. The answer to your first question is no. We really did not have any material changes in pricing or even the timing of pricing that would have affected the results the way that we're talking about here. In terms of the noncore revenue, I think is the question, we have created value bundles and we marketed those this year, bundles that include, we call them, Flots and other kinds of bundles that have things like fraud, audit defense and the ability to make sure that if anything happened, we had the ability for you to go in and keep an eye on your credit card and your credit reports. Those value-added bundles, they were ways that we were able to basically continue to help customers see value and pay for it. But there wasn't anything that jumped out that was meaningfully different than any prior year trends, to be honest with you. You said you had another question after that? Ross MacMillan Just one for Neil or maybe Jerry. Just a clarification that when we look at the QuickBooks Online subscribers and we look at 360,000 self-employed, 433,000 international, are those mutually exclusive? Or if some of the international include self-employed and if so, do you have a sense of how much? Jerome Natoli Yes, Ross, some of those international subs do include QuickBooks Self-Employed. We've had self-employed out there in the U.K. and in Australia now and in Canada, that we've just launched, as Brad said, a minute ago. We haven't broken out that specific number for QuickBooks Self-Employed within the 433,000 international. It's a pretty small fraction at this point, yes. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger Brad, could you comment? We haven't heard a lot about fraud this year. And obviously, the -- some of the late start to the year was probably related to some IRS changes and I know you're not going to share your strategies for next year at this juncture. But what are you hearing and seeing out of the IRS for how the tax season may start next year? And then again, circling back to that fraud discussion and what you saw year-over-year, just as an industry perspective. Brad Smith Yes, Scott, I would say what we saw was incredibly encouraging. The industry once again locked arms, not only the do-it-yourself industry, the professional tax preparers and the banking industry as well as the IRS in the federal and then the state level too. And I think we all feel like we continue to push the ball forward in terms of getting the bad guys out of the system. We won't know the dimensions of how much we were able to do until the IRS comes out and reports that out in late summer, early fall.  But everyone of us collectively believe that we continue to advance the cause and we're going to stay at this. It's going to be a multiyear ongoing effort until we get every cybercriminal out of the system that we can. So that's sort of bucket 1. Now what are the impacts to next year? There are a lot of things this season that everyone's still processing, things that we ended up requiring tax filers to do. Next year, we hope to be able to do with less friction and one of them was the one that Neil mentioned in his opening comments which is in an effort to try to ensure we got cybercriminals out, if you did not know your prior year adjusted gross income or you didn't know you tax filing PIN, then you were able to process your return using our software, but then you had to print it out and mail it. You could not e-file it without those 2 pieces of information. And that ended up, in our case, with about 500,000 people who were able to do their taxes in TurboTax but had to put it in an envelope and send it into the IRS. So I think next year, industry and the IRS in the States will say is that the experience we want to continue or is there something we can do that's just as equally protective but less friction for the taxpayer. But right now, it's too early to know what those are. We'll work those over the summer and talk to you about them in the fall when we do our Investor Day. Scott Schneeberger All right. And then just following up, Neil and you may have already covered it in your discussion of return of capital, but year-to-date, a little bit lighter than would have been expected, I think, on share repurchases. I realize there were some debt reduction going on in this recent quarter. But is there any -- yes, well, in response to share count for the full year, any change to that outlook or any catch-up anticipated back to prior year levels? And you may not want to address this year because it's near term, but how should we think about share repurchase going out on a run rate a few years out? Neil Williams Yes, Scott, I would tell you that I think Q3 is a bit of an anomaly. As you mentioned, we did have those senior notes that were due in March. And so we had some cash we allocated to debt reduction. And frankly, the matrix we had in our 10b5 also was a little more conservative at higher stock prices. So we didn't buy as many shares and at some of the higher price points at times, during the quarter, when we had to be out in the market for other reasons. So our stock repurchase plan has worked really great for us and so I would view Q3 being more of an anomaly than a trend going forward. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne Brad, I think in your prepared comments, you mentioned that there was about 11% contribution from TurboTax on the QBO business. And I was wondering if you could just sort of comment on was that about as expected. Was it better than you thought? I'm just trying to get a sense on, yes, you guys obviously were expecting some contribution from TurboTax to QBO. Did that outperform and I guess if there was any specific reason why when you look back at the strength in the quarter in QBO subs? Brad Smith Yes. Thanks, Kirk. So you're referring to the 11 points of QuickBooks Online growth that we got from TurboTax Self-Employed, sending customers over. That was healthy. We had aspirations that we thought would be very positive. I've got to tell you that we were delighted and surprised that we saw the strength in the TurboTax channel feeding QuickBooks Self-Employed which gives us even more reason to lean in more aggressively next year. And so I would say that we did not have 11 points modeled in, at the same time, we'll take it and we're going to say how do we blow on that ember and turn it into a raging fire as we look at next year. Kirk Materne And if I could ask just one quick follow-up. I assume, when you're getting benefits from the TurboTax channel, that tends to be more disproportionate in the U.S. -- on the U.S. QBO business than on the international, just based on sort of where your channel space is right now. Is that fair? Brad Smith It is. We have TurboTax in the U.S. and Canada. So we'll have the ability to pass into that channel that way. But we're also working with QuickBooks Self-Employed in all the other countries to say it doesn't have to go to an Intuit tax product, they can see it in accountants. And as a result, accountants will recommend QuickBooks Self-Employed to get more tax customers. So think about this being a strategy that works everywhere. It just may not go into TurboTax like it does in the U.S. and Canada. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. James MacDonald Just following up on Scott's question on fraud. Do you think that affected the unit growth in the market as a whole and maybe will affect unit growth in future years? Brad Smith Yes, Jim, I really wish I knew the explanation on the unit growth at the IRS level. We can go back to 2013, where the industry really lined up and everyone got aggressive and we were all trying to get security beefed up and kind of get cybercriminals out. And in 2014, we actually saw the IRS return to grow over 1%. So even though we took a big bite of the apple then, it didn't slow down total tax returns. Now we continue to get better and better each year. So I really can't tell you and we're trying to hesitate to put out other hypotheses because I probably heard a half a dozen myself just having conversations. I think we'll have to wait and see what the IRS comes out with and then we'll be able to compare their data with ours and we will be as transparent as possible at Investor Day of what we think ultimately led to this very unusual tax filing season with the IRS. James MacDonald Okay. Great. And just a quick follow-up. You haven't given a number, but is it proper math to say if you grew TurboTax units -- revenue 9% and units 2%, that the price mix impact was 7%? Or is that incorrect math? Brad Smith You know what, that math works for me. Coming from where I come from, that's exactly the way we calculated it too. James MacDonald Okay. Just trying to figure out if units had a bigger impact in some way, shape or form. Brad Smith No, you actually got it. We looked at -- we actually broke it down and looked at the revenue per return and it's roughly 7% as well. And it was driven by that 60-20-20 mix I mentioned a little while ago. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman Well, just quickly following up on your -- on the last question. To what extent did the 500,000 returns that didn't get counted as do-it-yourself get counted however in tax, in your tax revenue? And then I have several more. Brad Smith Yes, Michael. So let me take this one then and then we'll get back to your other ones. That 500,000, they ended up processing using our product and paying that. So that's in that revenue per return. But then when they showed up at the IRS, the IRS counted them as paper because they showed up in an envelope and not coming through on e-file. So if you had to throw those 500,000 back into the mix which is why you heard Neil say that those don't show up in the IRS category growth numbers and they don't show up in our share counts because we always compare our stuff against the IRS. But there's 500,000 that we did get paid for, so that shows up in our revenue, but it doesn't necessarily show up when the IRS prints its numbers and says, whoa, paper grew for the first time in a few years while it was because people processed with software and then had to mail it in because they didn't know their PIN. Michael Millman Okay. So it would suggest that the 7% that you just talked about, increase in price, really, that doesn't particularly jive with what you just said about increased number of returns... Brad Smith I'm sorry, yes. We're not tracking the same way. Go ahead, Neil. Neil Williams The 500,000, Michael, are in our unit number that we disclosed that we said was up 2%. Michael Millman Oh, so they are in your numbers. Neil Williams They're in our unit numbers... Brad Smith Yes, we're talking two different things here, Michael. I'm sorry, we're talking units which we said were up 2%. E-files which are ultimately the IRS when you receive those and then they count those as were those paper or software, that's where the numbers get a little bit out of sorts. But our numbers are 2% unit growth, 9% year-to-date revenue growth and the average revenue per unit went up about 7% and that was the math that Jim was just asking about a few minutes ago as well. Michael Millman Okay. So it does seem, when you look at your numbers down from up 15% to 2%, the IRS 5 7 down to kind of 0.2, that it was a bigger -- you had a bigger effect than the IRS and leads to sort of the next question, is that you indicated that you were affected at the low end or the free end. And so I kind of wonder, to what extent that, that was blocked doing many more free but also increasing but free, covered, would seem to hurt your potential complexity. I was kind of also interested in the effect of Comer which a lot of people talked about, but maybe you can give us some numbers on it. And then the other side of the coin is TaxACT going the other way. And we see that as having some impact on the industry. Brad Smith Okay, Michael. So let me try to parse that and I'll say that I think it was the collective competitive environment with all the names that you mentioned, including us, that led to a little more of an even distribution of who got the free, free customers. And over the last several years, we were out there pretty much alone with the Absolute Zero program. And this year, everyone dove in and decided they wanted a piece of that pie. Now it happened to coincide with the fact that after 3 years of that being our main message, we chose to pivot our broadcast, our TV advertising to more SmartLook which was the assisted -- transform assisted. So we sort of went dark in terms of broadcast media. On the free message, we still had that in digital. And they all came out with TV ads. And so I think that's why we allowed ourselves to kind of let some of this free, free customers to go elsewhere. And suffice it to say, regardless of whether it was the competitors you named or others, we don't plan to play the game the same way next year. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Patrick Colville with Arete Research. Patrick Colville Can you help me understand the acceleration in self-employed? So I mean, judging by the other questions asked in the call, it's clear that was just an inflection in growth in the U.S. So what was the cause of that inflection? Brad Smith Yes, so Patrick, it's a combination of things. First of all, there's just a secular trend of the gig economy. It's now estimated to be about 34% of the workforce and expected to be 43% by the year 2020. And these individuals have complexity to have to separate their personal business expense and then in the case of the United States, they have to follow Schedule C. And so ultimately, when you put that together, you say there's a lot more of them. We've been signing partnerships with Uber, Lyft, TaskRabbit, DoorDash, you name it, we've got all kinds of partnerships out there. And we've been working aggressively with the accountant channel because for the accountants, these are some of the hardest customers to serve because they don't have their steps sorted out, they come in at tax time and it's really laborious for the accountant to get the stuff all separated. So the accountants and the partnerships have been driving it. And then the second thing is we have 60 million people who come to QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks.com every year. That is a huge funnel. And now by introducing this as one of the product lineup SKUs, we're able to capitalize on our own web traffic and convert those into customers. The last piece I would say is 2 parts. One is new channels and one was TurboTax.com which added 160,000 QuickBooks Self-Employed units in the last quarter. And the other was new geographies, where we just introduced it in Singapore and we'll be opening up to other countries as well. So I'll put a bow around it and say, secular trends, we have channels with accountants and our own web marketing and partnerships like with Uber that are growing the core business. You add to that the opportunity to go with TurboTax as a channel and then open new geographies and we think self-employed has a lot of opportunity for growth as we look ahead. Patrick Colville Got it. And can I just quickly follow up. So do you think this, the self-employed, is expanding the category? Or is there some, a small amount of cannibalization at the low end of kind of the desktop products? Brad Smith I am so happy you asked that question. I have been dying to share this data. I had truly been waiting. I was even going to add it to my closing comments if no one asked. So over the last several quarters, actually, for the last couple of years, we've been talking about what percent of customers are new to the franchise coming into QuickBooks and then what percent of new customers are choosing an online version versus desktop. We used to say 80% of all the customers coming into QBO were new to the franchise. Well, now with self-employed, it moved above 90%. The other thing is, now when you have a customer going to our website and saying, do I want the desktop version or online, we now have over 80% of them choosing an online version of the product, whether it's self-employed or QBO. That was 70% just a quarter ago and it was just in the 60s 12 months ago. So this is expanding the category. And what's that mean? If you count the number of customers who bought one of our products and paid for it in the last 12 months, that total paying customer base is up 40% and that's up from 34% just 90 days ago. So it is expanding the category with some pretty exciting opportunities ahead of us. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Yun Kim with Benchmark. Yun Kim Can you just talk about what are -- what you are thinking about the overall ASP headwind that you are obviously experiencing in some level as your self-employed mix becomes larger and larger? If I did my math right, I think about half of the new QBO subs -- sub-adds in the quarter was given by self-employed. Obviously, given the opportunity to aggressively add new QBO subs, especially around self-employed subs, what are some of the parameters and metrics that you are monitoring or using to ensure some cost discipline around the QBO acquisition cost? Brad Smith Sure, thank you. First of all, I would say, this is why we've tried to articulate the 2 things that we measure inside and we talk about in our operating reviews and with our board and it is growing the subscriber base north of 40% and growing the total online ecosystem revenue 25% to 30%. And we just posted 59% on the first number and we just posted the second consecutive quarter of online ecosystem revenue growing at 30%. So it's the high end of that 25% to 30%. The second point I would say is, our emphasis right now is razors, not blades. Whether it's self-employed going after the hundreds of millions around the world at the point of the spear or it's QuickBooks Online, where we're trying to continue to accelerate and get new customers into the franchise and out of spreadsheets, that is our absolute top priority.  And as you can see, that is driving online ecosystem revenue growth, where we're at the high end of the range at 30% 2 quarters in a row. In terms of the discipline, Neil referred to this a few minutes ago when we were asked about the margins continuing to expand even while we're in a pretty heavy investment mode to expanding to new countries. And that's because we watch LTV to CAC, the lifetime value divided by the cost to acquire a customer. And every country has a target and as you know, we've collectively been driving our LTV to CAC. If you look at QBO across the globe, it's around 5.5. 5.5. And if you throw in desktop, it's about 6.9. So we're maintaining that discipline. But we're focused on the razors, whether it's self-employed or it's QBO. We'ren't worried about whether one is $10 a month or one is $24 a month because we focus on LTV to CAC to make sure we have the right discipline and cost to acquire and that's driving overall revenue growth and margin expansion. Yun Kim Okay. Great. Real quick on the tax business. It's just a quick fundamental question, Brad. Are you still committed to going after the new taxpayers coming into the market, even if this means that there could be some incremental margin headwind to get those customers given the increasing competition for those customers? Brad Smith Yes. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no further questions. Would you like to close with any additional remarks? Brad Smith Sure, Brian, I'll keep it short. Well, we want to thank everybody for the questions today. Obviously, we're feeling good with the quarter. More importantly, we feel like we have momentum that we're building as we enter the fourth quarter and we have some important lessons learned that will sharpen our thinking as we look ahead to next year. So looking forward to catching up with you soon. And with that, thanks for the time this afternoon. Take care. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

So with that out, I move now out of the way, let me go ahead and introduce Jeff. Jeff Epstein, our Chief Financial Officer. Jeff Epstein Thank you very much. And for those of you who didn't know, it's Ken Bond, our Vice President of Investor Relations. And we also have in the front of the room Paul Ziats from Sun joining us now and someone who if you don't know you should get to know because he knows a lot about, probably more about Sun than I do at this point, I'm looking forward to learning a lot more. And in the back of the room, we have two of our distinguished members of our Board of Directors, Don Lucas and Bruce Chizen. So let's start. We are looking for with the Sun-Oracle combination, we believe we'll have both significant cost savings and revenue opportunities leading to higher operating profits. And I'm going to start describing our philosophy which some of you've seen before, but since many of the people on this call may not have seen this, I think it's worthwhile to give a general review and then get specific. We have an approach to Oracle business processes, which we call business engineering, it's taking an engineer's mindset to our systems and processes and trying to do things better. And there's four parts to this. The first is, simplify. So let's take a look at how Sun is doing a process today for whatever historic reasons they're doing it and say, that the best way to do it, but if it's not, we'll change it. Turns out over the last nine months through hundreds of meetings with literally thousands of Sun employees and Oracle employees, we've looked and mapped every Sun process, we have what we call playbooks, written playbooks that says on this date, this is what we're going to do on this date, this is what we're going to do. And there are well over 100 processes that will change from whatever Sun is doing to the way Oracle's doing it. So we're going to go from the old way of doing it to the best way of doing it. We're standardizing. Sun fundamentally has -- is not a centralized company, it's been decentralized and does many things in different ways. So we're going to go from many different ways of doing it to the one best way of doing that process. And then in keeping also with centralization, geographically trying to do it instead of in every country in the world and every location doing the process in fewer shared service center locations where you can get economies of scale. And then finally, there's still a number of manual processes and being a technology company, we would like to automate those technologies with Oracle software. And Sun already is using an older version of Oracle e-Business Suite, so that involves upgrading to Oracle e-Business Suite 12 and moving the Sun supply chain systems onto the Oracle supply chain module. So we have a lot of work to do. We've been spending, we've had more time than we've ever had before to plan in detail all of these changes that we're making in the systems and processes. And we're very excited about being at the starting gate today and getting a chance to implement these changes. Let me get going to a little further detail on some of the things you heard earlier today from (inaudible) for instance in supply chain. And so one of the major areas that we're going to making some changes is supply chain. And I think there was a misunderstanding among some analysts of cutting costs equals cutting headcount. And that's the reason that that's not the case here is because the largest cost at Sun is cost of goods sold, is the product cost and so the way to save money is by figuring out a better way to produce products at lower costs. And obviously the back office type of things and labor costs are an important component, but actually much smaller than cost of goods sold. So supply chain is extremely essential to our financial plan. So what are we going to do? The same philosophy I talked about in terms of our back office processes, simplify, standardize, centralize and automate applies to supply chain as well. So we went in and we talked with Cindi [ph] and the rest of her team and said, how many different parts do you have, how many different combinations of parts do you have and the answer was tens of thousands and so why do you have so many? And they said well, every time a salesman says I want a unique combination for a customer, we say yes. And that's what we find at many companies we acquire, which is Oracle is very good at saying no. And companies we acquire aren't so good. And so we say we're going to do what makes sense for us. We're going to produce fewer products, fewer combinations of products. And then our salespeople are going to go out and sell those. And if every single customer doesn't get exactly what they want, maybe not every customer's going to buy that product but we don't want to sell products that we lose money on. So if the cost of supplying tens of thousands of combinations means we can't make money, why should we be in that business? So what we're doing is we are taking the Sun footprint. And we're focusing it on the highest value products, the most popular combinations of products. And then we're modularizing them because every product is made of components to how many core, storage and servers and so you can by having common components and then building a limited set of products, we can dramatically lower our costs in terms of manufacturing and supply chain. So that's what the first item is. The second item which Cindi mentioned was move from build to stock to build to order. This is a major change in the philosophy of the company. A customer says I want to buy something. And I want it to be inventoried today. I need it shipped to me this afternoon. We may not have it in stock for them tomorrow. Sun built their business and tried to do that. We think the value added is in the product and the engineering. The value added is not in the logistics. And that's what we have partners for. So you heard today about how we're going to go direct to our largest customers, but we'll work extensively with value-added partners. And those value-added partners I'm sure will stock inventory. They'll place orders in advance. And so in effect, we're letting these very large companies with enormous logistics investments take advantage of their infrastructure so we don't have to build warehouses and maintain warehouses and maintain inventory everywhere. So we're going to see substantial decreases in inventory, substantial improvements in our -- again, manufacturing and logistics costs because we will focus on large volumes of the products that we think we can do well at and let outside partners and logistics operators handle the inventory and carrying costs. An example of that would be plug; I got some direct ship in a minute. So let me talk about centralized supply chain with fewer build locations. There's a philosophy of -- we want to have multiple manufacturers for multiple products because we like the idea of getting people to bid against each other. We don't think that's necessary. We think we're big enough on our own that if we can negotiate attractive deals. And if for whatever reason a vendor, an outsource manufacturer says that they're going to raise the price on us we just won't use them again for the next product. So we will have many fewer producers in terms of outsourced manufacturing that Sun currently has today. And we'll get volume discounts, lower costs, higher volumes with more focused purchasing. So we'll have fewer vendors with lower cost. And then also we talked about how fewer parts, less supply chain fragmentation means that we'll have lower cost in the distribution chain and then implement 100% direct ship for all products. Sun had been having consolidated shipping. So if they were, someone ordered ten different products, they would have ten products shipped to a Sun location, they'd wait to assemble it all together and then reship it. So you would have examples of things where a customer in Asia would order a product which was manufactured in Asia but was shipped from the United States. So the manufacturer shipped it to a warehouse in the United States would've been shipped back to Asia. And we looked at that and we said, why are you doing this? And they said well, because we want to have this terrific, we have these warehouses. And we want to consolidate a shipment. We said, we don't think you're getting value for that. We don't think that's really what customers are paying for, they're paying for the product. And so we're going to go to 100% direct ship. Now if, again if we have customers who for whatever reason feel they need the inventory faster, that's where the partners will provide the value. So essentially, what we're able to do is we're going to focus on the engineering. And we're going to, we've already -- Sun has already outsourced manufacturing and in a way, we're going to work with our partners to not invest a lot of time and effort and cost in the shipping inventory and logistics and warehousing. And then finally, optimized sale, Sun sales qualification policies, this comes back to just saying no. Sun from time to time will take orders, manufacture products, but customers who said they're interested in a product but just haven't made up the purchase order yet, so please will you make it for us and then or by the way, maybe we decided changed our mind. We don't need it. Then Sun is stuck with the inventory. And he'd have to scrap it or has to remanufacture it. And that's not our way of doing business. So we're going to not manufacture until we get an order to be signed, order where there's a commitment on the part of the customer. So there's a whole series of activities where for various historical reasons, Sun felt compelled to have a number of practices which is not in keeping it the way Oracle has done business. And we're changing those starting today. So we are very excited about the opportunities. We think our customers will appreciate the fact that we're taking costs out of the system. So they're going to get value because they're going to get highly engineered products which are differentiated, which are very effective for them, they'll be able to get the kind of quick delivery and turnaround time they need from their partners if that's important for them. But if it's not important for them, they're not paying for it. And we've eliminated cost from the system. Let me turn to a quick overview of an elaboration of what Cindi talked about in terms of the improvements in supply chain. And in terms of dollar terms, this is a very significant number. It's a large difference in Sun's cost structure compared to Oracle's cost structure. Let me talk about customer services. Juergen Rottler who runs Oracle's customer services, talked earlier about the plan and he talked about My Oracle Support. Sun today has multiple levels of support. So there's multiple quality levels, different country levels, different turnaround times. We think there's unnecessary complexity in there. And we just want to have one very high level of support for everybody. We think it simplifies everything; the cost of delivering the support is much more streamlined and lower cost for us. And it can be higher value for the customer. And in fact, there's a history here because we had a similar type of thing happen in software support, where many years ago we had multiple software combinations. And we just went to one level of software support at 22% of the purchase price. Everyone gets the same high quality level of software support and it's worked very well. And we think that this will work well as well. And then we're going to combine the support delivery mechanism into the My Oracle Support portal. So when a customer has a problem with hardware, they will go to the same place they go to with when they have a software problem. Today, 75% of Sun's support inquiries are by the telephone, which means Sun has to have a lot of people answering the telephone to find out what's going on. Oracle has less than 5% of our support inquiries by telephone. Almost, all are through the internet. Most engineers who are the people who are submitting these support inquiries would rather go on the internet just the way that when I buy a book, I'd rather buy it on Amazon online than call up someone and talk to a human being to order a book if it's long distance, so it's just a more efficient way of doing it. And it's one of those things that Sun wanted to get around to. For whatever reason, they didn't. We're going to have this launched in the near future, where we'll move the Sun support base onto My Oracle Support. Optimized after market repair and logistics cost, we talked already about how from a supply chain point of view, we're going to have fewer parts. And that will reduce also the support cost because it'll simplify things there. We're going to streamline the number of depots. Sun felt that they had to have inventory in every city around the world or a large number of cities around the world. And that meant enormous extra inventory cost because you had to have small amounts of inventory everywhere instead of fewer, larger amounts of inventory and then use shipping or use your partners for people who have critical applications. And then the support third party providers Sun did not have as comprehensive an offering of support services by Sun employees. They had a lot of non-Sun employees providing support, a lot of partners supplying support. And our view is, certainly for the major customers in the major countries, those will all be Oracle employees providing that service. And we'll get the value for that. And then finally, we talked about the automated self-service system support plans based on My Oracle Support. So customer service is the secondary after supply chain. And then finally, the area that is probably more familiar with everyone here because it's similar to the software side of it, which is the back office infrastructure, we have a very effective and efficient global infrastructure in all of our back office operations. We have the capacity to handle incremental volume at low marginal costs. We're talking about the financial operations, legal operations, marketing which I'll come back to in a minute, HR and procurement is obviously the combined benefit of having the two companies together. We can get better prices and more focused buying. We talked about the supply chain procurement, where we're going to have concentrated buying with fewer vendors, but then all the non-supply chain procurement we're going to have enormous economies of scale. Facilities, we have a lot of ops buildings, they have a lot of ops buildings. We can consolidate space. Sun already has a lot of empty space that they weren't using because their headcount today is much lower than it was a few years ago. So I think we're going to be pretty good at combining the offices of Oracle and Sun city-by-city and over time dramatically reducing the number of square feet that we need. And then IT is going to be very substantial savings because we have a very efficient datacenter operation fundamentally, virtually all of Oracle's computing is done in our Austin datacenter. So instead of having multiple datacenters and multiple development labs all over the world, we have fewer much more cost efficient centers. And we've done a great job of lowering our cost of IT. And there's a lot of opportunity at Sun. Let me come back to marketing. Sun for -- I think many years now has devoted a fair amount of effort in marketing to non-revenue related marketing. Their marketing people were evaluated for instance, on a cost per download type of metric. And our marketing is based on cost per lead or cost per converted lead type of metric. So we're going to see a big shift in marketing. It's a large dollar amount. And we will continue to spend a fair amount of dollars in the aggregate. But most of those dollars will be spent on media and on measurable media which have a direct result of supporting sales as opposed to just generally getting awareness and getting people who are not customers, who are not paying customers to use the products. So there's a whole series of ways in the non-product area where we think we can save costs. And then all the systems will run on the Oracle global single instance. We showed this slide earlier today that the key difference between this acquisition and our other 60-plus acquisitions is there's a supply chain element. Fortunately, the supply chain that's required is the Oracle e-Business Suite supply chain, which we happen to know a lot about rest as the slide says, we've done thousands of implementations of this product. We have our own development team, who wrote the code, who can help us implement it. So while it'll take a little longer than a smaller company acquisitions because of the scale of Sun, we're very confident we can implement the Oracle e-Business Suite supply chain modules very effectively and then run on a single global instance on the Oracle IT structure. Beyond that, everything else is comparable to other acquisitions we've done. 99% of Sun employees work in areas that are comparable to Oracle departments. Fewer than 1% of Sun employees work in manufacturing and supply chain. So who are all the Sun employees? They're engineers. They're salespeople. There's education, training, consultants, support, back office, so we understand those functions. And we've done 60 acquisition integrations. So we have detailed written playbooks and we're highly confident we can be effective and timely in getting those integrations done. So we've talked mostly about cost. And I'd like to talk about revenue, because revenue, as Larry said, is an important part of this equation. There's going to be some transition period because there's some revenue that Sun generates today that they don't make money on. And so the simplest thing to do is to stop is to sell less of things that you're losing money on, which will tend to decrease revenue and then sell more of the things you do make money on, which will increase revenue. They'll both be happening at the same time over the course of the next 18 months. So the aggregate revenue may not grow that much, but you're going to see these underlying trends. And then, of course, once the declining stops, the products that are growing will come out, as you'll see in 2012. So what are the things that we'll do less of? Sun sells third party products today, where they're essentially just a distributor of other companies products. And the salespeople are paid on revenue. So even though Sun makes a very small gross margin and in some cases they lose money on an operating margin basis when costs are fully allocated, the salesperson still makes money. So if I can sell a $1 million worth of a third party product or I can sell a $1 million of a Sun software product, where I have 100% margin, the customer, the salesperson makes the same sales commission. So we're going to change that. And we're going to compensate our salespeople based on the margin they contribute, which will have the effect of reducing the amount of third party low-margin sales that they make so that revenue side will go down. And then if you look at the Sun product line and you see there are some high margin products and low margin products, when we compensate our salespeople based on margin, they're going to figure it out pretty quickly. We've worked with salespeople for a long time and it just turns out they figure it out in about a day, what products are the ones to sell. And we think they're going to sell a lot more of the high margin products and many fewer of the lower margin products. And that will dramatically change the revenue profile overall. So let's start with at the top of the slide, engineering. We're going to also shift our engineering focus to invest heavily in the high value, differentiated products and have increased investment in those areas. And in addition, having these database appliances or appliances where the hardware and the software are engineered together (inaudible) being the first one, we'll have a series of new products, we're investing heavily in engineering to make great products that are differentiated that are multiple times better, order of magnitude times better than competing products. Customer services, we've talked about how important that is. Renewing and upselling existing hardware support and increasing attach rates, virtually every customer who buys and Oracle product today buys support, that's not the case with Sun. Some customers are not buying support at all. Some customers are getting support from partners. Some customers may be getting the support, but they're not paying for it. And we have a disciplined approach to all this. And we think that our policies and our value added, so we'll start with giving really high quality support, which is essential. But then also through our policies and through our working with our customers who we already have relationships with we think we can dramatically increase the attach rate and increase the support revenue. And then the field changes are going to be very significant. So we talked before about having high margin revenue going direct. So the largest 4,000 customers, we will sell direct to. We will make a higher profit margin on that revenue than we are today through that Sun is through partners. And yet we'll still continue these partners for the other tens of thousands of customers. And where there are value-added partners in particular segments like telecommunications, even for the large customers, we'll work with partners, but the question there is, is the partner adding value? Is it doing more than just taking the order and arranging for the shipping? And we value the direct relationship with these 4,000 large customers. Second is compensation. We're changing the compensation system immediately in the countries where we're legally allowed to and as soon as we can in the countries where there's going to be some delay, but you're going to see dramatic changes in the sales compensation, which is well aligned with how Oracle compensates sales executives, which is it's the revenue minus the controllable costs. In Oracle's case, the controllable costs include the sales expense and T&E, some direct cost for the office space that the sales manager's responsible for and of course, in Sun's case, it's also going to include the cost of the products. So it's the philosophy, the Oracle philosophy applied to a hardware business. And we've already seen at Oracle how that dramatically changes sales behavior. And we're very excited about that change. And then finally, this last point is very important. Oracle's to detect Oracle's sales strategy today for support is that when an Oracle sales executive sells software; they also sell the first year of support because it's sort of combined with that initial sale. Then the second year of support, which is the renewal, which is much easier because the customer's already using the product, presumably happy with it that's the renewal is handled by the support sales organization. So that was not the case at Sun, so we're going to move Sun where the hardware salesperson at Sun is also going to be incented to sell the first year of hardware support. And we think that will have a dramatic increase in the support attach rate, so a number of different opportunities. And to try to summarize the financial strategy, there is, I do need to highlight this, as I said before, there's literally over 100 types of changes like this that we're doing in terms of policies and procedures and processes. And these are in my view what the most important ones, in terms of cost savings, optimizing the supply chain because that's the biggest cost element for a product company; simplifying and standardizing customer support, which can help reduce our cost while we're increasing the value of support and streamlining the back office and marketing and having substantial savings and economies of scale there. At the same time, we're going to grow revenue in the areas of the high margin products and drive profitable revenue by focusing in engineering and sales on the highly differentiated, high value technologies by going direct to our 4,000 largest customers by compensating our sales teams on margin, not on revenue and by improving the support attach rates, which as you know from Oracle is an extremely important part of our profit model. So the numbers, we expect Sun in the first full year of ownership, which is fiscal 2011 to have $9.6 billion of revenue. And we expect, as we've already previously stated, $1.5 billion of operating income, which translates to $0.15 per share or more depending on how you allocate the interest expense and the cost of capital and all those things, so rather than get into that, we're focusing on the operating income line. And then in fiscal 2012, we believe we can continue increasing our profitability. Some of the programs that I've talked about in changing won't be able to happen; we'll do them as quickly as we can. But they won't all have an impact for the full year fiscal 2011. And so some of that impact, we'll get the benefit as well in fiscal 2012. And we expect $2 billion of incremental operating income in 2012. So can we do it? I've outlined what we expect to do. And now the question you all have to decide is, can we execute? And from my point of view, I'm just continue to be very excited about the quality of our internal teams at Oracle, the quality of the cooperation we're getting from the Sun teams, the enthusiasm from the Sun people in working with us because I think they've been frustrated at working with a company that's been losing money for a number of years and has revenue declining, they want to be on a winning team. They see what Oracle's talked about. And they are onboard. And so what we've done in the past is when we've made these acquisitions, we've typically bought companies with lower operating margins. And as I showed this slide earlier, just simply the arithmetic average of our margin back in 2004, 39%, plus the companies we acquired would've meant our overall margin of decline and factor of our margin grew which demonstrates our ability both at the Oracle base and the acquired revenues to use these techniques, both in terms of things like high quality support at fair prices, things like sales compensation, which align sales incentives with shareholder incentives and things like back office efficiency to increase our profitability margins. And we're going to do this importantly not by cutting R&D. We're going to continue to invest very heavily in R&D. Engineering is the lifeblood at Oracle, it's also very important at Sun. We want to make terrific high quality products, price them fairly and get full value for them and then run the business cost effectively. And so we expect to have $4.3 billion at research and development in fiscal 2011, which is almost triple what Oracle had back when we started the acquisition program. Thank you very much. And Ken, I'll turn it back to you for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Ken Bond Sure. We're going to go ahead and do a Q&A session. What I want to do is I know there's lots of questions here in the room, but for those folks that are out on the internet webcast, just send a reminder to you all that you do have an opportunity if you're dialed in the webcast to ask questions. So what we'll do is at a later point, Jeff we'll kind of bring back some questions from the internet, but for now why don't we go in the room. So, Sarah do you want to kind of kick it off? Sarah Friar  Goldman Sachs Great. Do you want me to grab a mic for the webcast or Ken Bond We've got a one Sarah Friar  Goldman Sachs You can clearly hear me. Thanks very much, Sarah Friar from Goldman Sachs. Jeff, very bear bull in guidance, are you willing to go a little deeper and just give us any sense of even the split between products and services, for example for Sun? So that $9.6 billion, we've kind of estimated something around a 55 product, 45 services split because it helps us think about the margins. And then on the gross margin side, kind of expectations there in terms of can you move the needle on the gross margin for Sun? How do we think about the shift between COGS and OpEx? Jeff Epstein Okay. So two questions, first of all, what is our guidance policy going to be? And secondly, what about cost of goods sold in particular? Our guidance policy for a long period of time has been that we've given one quarter guidance out and with a fair amount of information. And we will do the same, so on our next quarterly conference call, when we close Q3, we will give guidance for Q4, including hardware and software. And we will describe what, when I say hardware and software, I mean what we're expecting from incrementally from Sun as opposed to Oracle. And we will continue to do that going forward every quarter. In terms of cost of goods sold, we clearly expect to have substantial cost savings in the supply chain which means we think that the, our gross margin is going to improve. Sarah Friar  Goldman Sachs I'm sorry, I just want to clarify. Thank you. That was very helpful. But just on the product service split, what I was asking was more for Sun specifically? Jeff Epstein Right. Sarah Friar  Goldman Sachs Are you going to give us any gradation between their product and their services line? Jeff Epstein We're not giving it now. Sarah Friar  Goldman Sachs Okay. Jeff Epstein And we'll be evaluating the kind of guidance we're going to give before the next quarterly conference call. And then we'll give -- we're going to come up with something which we will be able to sustain every quarter. Adam Holt  Morgan Stanley Hi. It's Adam Holt from Morgan Stanley. If you look at the revenue numbers for fiscal '11, it's a little bit below the run rate we saw in September, but yet you have $1.5 billion in operating income, which implies the additional hiring you talked about today is going to be at least offset, if not more than offset by the cost cuts. I just wanted to think about or to ask you how you're thinking about that balance. Will hiring be based on what you see on the cost saving side or more driven by what you see on the revenue side? Jeff Epstein Well, a lot of the hiring is sales. For whatever reason Sun had a philosophy of not going direct, which meant they had few salespeople. And they went through partners. And so we are going to hire a lot of salespeople and particularly in the United States and take that business, direct business. And so the offset is the people we're hiring will be generating revenue day one, in fact, they may even be the same individuals because I think what has happened to some extent is there were Sun salespeople. Sun said let's go to partners, Sun laid off the salespeople. And the partners hired them. And we're going to hire them back. So what you heard today was a big ad for all of the Sun experienced salespeople who are interested in coming back to Sun to come back. And they're going to take the same accounts with them. So I think the incremental hiring will immediately add revenue and be profitable in terms of that side of that. And then in terms of the other revenue that the decline in revenue we believe will be in a product thats more profitable anyway. So even though, we I think on a last four quarters basis the 9.6 billion is down about 10%, that's around the kind of volume that we see where you could say take the lowest margin 10% of the business, there's really no operating income associated with that. So you're losing on profitable revenue. Adam Holt  Morgan Stanley And if I could just ask a real quick follow up, if you look at the operating income contribution in year two, it's a little over a 30% increase. Do you see that being driven by the revenue starting to reaccelerate? Or do you anticipate further efficiencies on the cost side to drive that increase in operating income? Jeff Epstein Well, we're not giving revenue guidance specifically for 2012 now. But clearly, you heard from Larry and from our other executives. We believe that Sun is a growth, a revenue growth opportunity. We think if we can come up with the products that we, we're highly confident we can, which are differentiated, we believe the Sun product line within Oracle will clearly be a revenue growth opportunity for us. We will hold off on giving guidance because we'll end up just giving guidance quarter by quarter. So I don't think we won't be giving fiscal '12 revenue guidance. That'll just come quarter by quarter. But the second part of your question is, is there some additional cost savings in fiscal '12? There probably is because some of the cost savings that we anticipate we won't be able to implement day one. So it'll some of that will flow through in full year fiscal '12. For instance, there's agreements with content manufacturers that don't expire for a certain amount of time, a whole series of things that we have planned but take time. Heather Bellini  ISI Group Hi. Thank you. Heather Bellini. Two questions for you Jeff. One, just to help people think about from the cost side of things, what percentage of the cost reductions are going to come from COG versus the percentage that we should expect to come from OpEx just in terms of helping us build out our models? And then also, given Sun had a different geographic footprint then you did the tax rate potential looks like it could go up in fiscal '11. Could you give us a sense for the magnitude you're talking about? Jeff Epstein Well, the first question on -- we're not going to give specific guidance on the components of cost. But each of the major components of cost are material. So cost of goods sold is clearly very important. The operating expense is going to be important. Marketing in itself is going to be an important line item. So there -- and then the avoiding of the partner cost. So that's not really on the income statement today. But there is cost in the system of having partner margin, which is outside of the system today, which will come into Oracle. And that's going to be a very significant portion to generate the revenue and margin that today is going to partners. So it's, each of those is material in terms of achieving the $1.5 billion target. The next question about attach rate is -- Heather Bellini  ISI Group No, tax rate. Jeff Epstein Tax rate. I'm sorry. Well, tax, we are not giving specific guidance on a tax rate yet. But there are a couple things I just want to point out. From an accounting point of view, Sun has very attractive tax loss carry forwards and tax attributes which don't show up in our income statement. Those are all, we get the benefit of that. But it goes onto the balance sheet and then will not affect our income statement going forward. So it's a meaningful amount of money in terms of the value to the company. But it's not going to affect your model. But then the other thing just to keep in mind is the way international tax planning works is you typically try to have your services, there are companies that have provide services and get service fees. So if a company is low margin, those service fees are a bigger percentage of the total. So ironically, since Oracle is very high margin, we get the benefit of that tax. Sun doesn't -- that tax planning and Sun doesn't. So it's possible that the Sun incremental tax rate could be somewhat higher than the Oracle incremental tax rate. But I think it's too early to say that. Peter Goldmacher  Cowen & Co. Hi, Jeff. Peter Goldmacher at Cowen & Co. You guys spent a lot of time in the earlier session and this session talking about how you're changing the supply chain, how you're changing your whole build model and how you're changing your delivery to customer model. And here, you talked a little bit more about how you're changing your customer support model, pushing more support to the web. Maybe you can't get what you want. Maybe you can't, you have to wait a little bit longer for a box. I mean, these are big changes. I'm not as familiar with the hardware business as I will become I'm sure. But how different are your is your hardware support going to be from people like Dell and HP and IBM? And do you factor that into for some parts of the business that are more commodity oriented, was Sun's support because it was so accommodating, was that a competitive differentiator for a lot of these guys? Jeff Epstein Yeah. We're going to give very high-quality support. But customers who need the time-sensitive nature you're talking about will pay for it. So Sun has been providing -- Sun had a high cost structure to serve everybody when only some customers needed it. And so the way to at the end of the day, what will happen is customers that need that immediate turnaround time will have an opportunity to pay us for it or they'll pay a partner for it. So we will have a low cost structure giving customers the option. If they find value, they'll pay. And we'll -- it's a competitive market out there. I'm sure our support offerings will be competitive. I think one difference is our support I think will be much simpler. The standard out there among hardware providers is to have multiple levels, very complex structure. And we'll have to see if that remains the case. They may find that this is actually a better way to run the business than to have one level of very high-quality support and still give customers what they need. Peter Goldmacher  Cowen & Co. Thanks. Kash Rangan  Merrill Lynch Thank you very much. Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch here, Jeff. Jeff Epstein Hi. Kash. Kash Rangan  Merrill Lynch Back here. A bit of a comment. It looks like based on the operating margin contribution guidance for fiscal '12 that operating margins for the combined company probably go up in fiscal '12 as opposed to going down in fiscal '11. Actually, the first year, I would expect compared to Oracle standalone, margins obviously go down. And my question/clarification is the following year after the acquisition, would margins go back up? It would seem like they do go back up just based on the operating income growth of almost 30% in year two. I just want to make sure that that is indeed the way to look at the business because there's some skepticism among some investors that margins could be going down year after year because the hardware business is a lower-margin business, the faster the growth. And I just wanted to make sure that I'm on the same page with you in terms of the how the operating margins of the combined company look like in year two after the acquisition. Jeff Epstein Okay. Well, there's several elements to that. So let's just walk through the model together. Obviously, if you have a high-margin business like Oracle with margins in the 45-plus percent range and you have a lower-margin business like Sun, which just in the sort of 15% range if it's 1.5 billion on 9.6 billion; the weighted average of the combined company is lower than Oracle's. So by the math, it's simply that you have a lower margin to begin with. Then the question is what happens the next year. And the way to think about that is which there's two questions. One is which grows faster, the Sun part of the business or the Oracle part of the business? And then what happens to the Oracle margin? And what happens to the Sun margin? And we've publicly said before and I would reiterate today that we think over time Oracle's core business can continue to grow margin. There's no sort of cap that we're reaching for some reason. We think we can continue to grow our revenues at the rate that we have been growing, given the economy. And we think we can keep our cost growth lower than our revenue growth over cycles, over time. And the Sun business, we think we're starting the advantage of Sun, of course, we're starting from quite a low base. So we think that the Sun portion of that revenue and cost can also grow margin over time. So we expect over a multiyear period for the Sun portion of that business to grow. The question of what happens to Oracle's overall margin depends on the mix. If all of a sudden we tripled our hardware revenue, even though the hardware margin was growing, it would bring down the overall company margin now. I don't know that we're going to triple our hardware revenue overnight. So my guess is the inherent growth in the margin in the two businesses will outweigh whatever mix shift there is. But it's impossible to see until we see what the relative growth rates of the two businesses are. There's just one other element I'd like to mention which is, of course, we'll sell increasing number of products, which are both hardware and software. So when we have XTRA data, for instance, the hardware part of XTRA data will be reported as hardware. And the software part of XTRA data will be reported as software. Kash Rangan  Merrill Lynch The quick follow up is, on the channel side, you said that you'd be going direct. You seem like you're really comfortable with any risk associated with the change in the channel strategy. It seems like you can identify a lot of the old Sun salespeople, whatnot. How comfortable are you really that simply big change going from an indirect model to a direct model. You've got this revenue forecast for them. I'm just wondering how much of the last nine months have given you more and more comfort that this channel strategy change will not really impact the business? Jeff Epstein Well, it's possible there would be risk if we were talking about different customers. But these are our customers. Sun customers are -- Sun has fewer customers than Oracle. But virtually all of Sun's customers are already Oracle customers. So we know the CIO. We're selling to the same datacenter. So we have a high degree of confidence that just the personal relationships we have, the business relationships, the fact that they're still buying Oracle products while they're talking about Sun is something where a salespeople will want to work for Oracle because it's a lot easier job to work for Oracle selling Sun hardware than it was to work for Sun selling Sun hardware. So we'll get really high-quality people. They'll go into customers where they already have relationships even if they personally don't have relationships, an Oracle institutional relationship. And we've been -- as you said, we've had nine months to work on this, to talk to customers. Our customers have been very involved in these decisions, in these processes. You heard from people at the user groups. You saw customers testify in the EU about how excited they were working with us. And we just think this is really a big win for Sun customers because they're going to have -- I think they want a direct relationship with Oracle. And part of the reason is because they want to be able to have the direct channel. But also, they want to tell us what's wrong. And they want to say here's my list of complaints. Can you fix it? And it's easier to do that if you're a customer when you have a direct relationship. Brent Thill  UBS Hey, Jeff. Brent Thill with UBS. Just a follow up to Kash's question on the margin at 15%, not asking you in the near term, but what do you think the long-term margin target is for the Sun business? Is this a business that could be in the 20s? Jeff Epstein I wasn't sure that was the end of the question. We're not going to give a long-term margin. But I think that if you would've asked Oracle or any of you 10 years ago what Oracle's software margin was going to be in 2009, I don't know how many people would've said the margin we had. So I think what my observation is we have a pretty good way of running a business. If we can make terrific products that are differentiated and we get fair prices for them and then we can have a simplified, standardized structure of manufacturing, distribution and back office and we can be cost effective, I think we have very high profit margin potential even in the hardware business. Brent Thill  UBS And just a quick follow up. We've had a hard time I think collectively just trying to figure out what percent of Sun's business is software versus hardware because they commingle the maintenance with hardware and software. So is there a sense of -- can you give us a sense of what split the net revenue is roughly software versus hardware that you're expecting? Jeff Epstein Well, we will probably separate out the support revenue between hardware and software when we publicly disclose our numbers. So we'll give you a sense of that actually once we publish our numbers. Cathy, let's get Larry in the back here. Brent Thill  UBS That was actually part of my question is, when you begin reporting with Sun, how much detail are you going to provide so we can kind of monitor the success of the acquisition? And then I assume you did an analysis to derive the revenue target from top down and the bottom up. But if you look at the last two quarters, the run rate of the last two quarters is exactly $9.6 billion, which is depressed and down from almost 14 billion in the '08 year and 11.5 billion the year before. So are you just sort of assuming that this weakness in the whole environment in June and September is sort of the low water mark and a pretty conservative base? Or how did you arrive at the 9.6, which coincidentally is the run rate of the last two quarters? Jeff Epstein Right. It's a coincidence that it was the run rate of the last two quarters. We also looked at the last four quarters because there is -- like Oracle, there is quarterly seasonality, where there in a normal economic environment their fourth quarter is the biggest quarter the same way our fourth quarter's the biggest quarter because of the way sales compensation is structured. And so, I'm not sure any two quarters is representative. And also, it's given where the economy's been going and sort of the trend they've been on, I wouldn't put too much emphasis on that. We did build it up. As you said, we had -- we both took a macro view. We also took product-by-product view in terms of looking at how the businesses were and sales region by sales region. And we wouldn't be giving you a number unless we felt confident that we could achieve it. So our view is the $9.6 billion is our best estimate today of what we could achieve in fiscal 2011. And we could do better. We will report our Q3 in the new format. So we're not going to talk before that. But the actual press release and 10-Q will be in the new reporting format, which we'll continue to use going forward. Ken Bond Let me take a question from Michael. Then we'll take one last question after that. Michael Turits  Raymond James & Associates Thanks very much. Michael Turits from Raymond James. Larry said that it would be hiring 2,000 in the next few months and cutting less than half of that. Should we think of that as the way the right kind of proportion the year ends up? In other words, is it still a net higher, at least net flat because it seems that if it's not, then if you don't cut heads on a total for the year, it's hard to make OpEx cuts. And if you don't make OpEx cuts, that's 15 points of gross margin improvement, which is a lot. Jeff Epstein Right. Well, let me distinguish between laying people off and having fewer people. We have 85,000 people at Oracle. And Sun has over 20,000. So we're talking about 110,000 people as a base. And just through normal attrition, you're talking about many thousands of people leaving a company just through the normal course. And we don't have to replace every person who leaves. So we will get a benefit of cost savings not  through not replacing people, which could end up being a material amount of money. Michael Turits  Raymond James & Associates Right. So again, should we think of the -- so the net headcount at Sun as being flat for the year or going down in a meaningful way? Jeff Epstein Yeah. I think I'll just leave it at what I said. Clearly, we believe in the potential to be more efficient and have to do more with the number of people who we have. And if people leave and we can rationalize those positions, we'll take advantage of that. Michael Turits  Raymond James & Associates Thanks. Brendan Barnicle  Pacific Crest Securities Hi. Jeff, Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest. I had two. One, Larry was saying that Sun was going to be profitable in February and March, made a big deal out of that. So can we assume that we're going to see accretion in the February quarter and the May quarter? And second, when you think about the top line for the February and the May quarter contribution, should we be working off the same assumption of the sort of $9.6 million run rate that we're using for fiscal '11? Jeff Epstein Well, the February quarter is really just one month. And their quarters end in March. So it's not a quarter end month for them. So February is a seasonally slow month for Sun. So I wouldn't get too excited about the month of February. It's not going to -- it's obviously going to have some revenue for us. But it's not going to have a significant amount of profit or loss either way. And then in terms of our Q4, which would include their May year end rather it includes our -- sorry, our May year end the next three months, would be, we'll give guidance on that our next quarterly call. Ken Bond Jeff, we had a number of questions on the internet. Jeff Epstein Okay. Ken Bond A lot of them actually have been asked here in the room. But one that was not is may be if you could just give some color comments about how the acquisition of Sun might affect our balance sheet. Jeff Epstein Okay. There are three key elements when I think about the balance sheet separate from well, of course, there's the debt that we borrowed to pay for Sun and the cash and the debt position. We paid $7.4 billion. We're going to get $2 billion of Sun cash back. But the other elements are accounts receivable relative to accounts payable. We think of those as netting each other off. And then there's property, plant and equipment and then there's inventory. So accounts receivable, we've been writing in the mid-50s accounts receivable, they're at 72 days in terms of DSO. So we think that with our processes, our relationship with the same customers as we combine our collections, credit collections efforts. We certainly expect dramatic improvement in Sun's collection success. And we expect to bring the overall company DSO back down closer to the Oracle level. So that's the accounts receivable. On the inventories, they have on the order of $500 million worth of inventory. And we talked about a number of supply chain changes that we're having here in terms of simplifying the parts, having less inventory, fewer warehouses. And so I think we expect that to decline over time. And then capital expenditures and property, plant and equipment they have a fair amount in real estate facilities, which won't necessarily be needed on a combined basis because we have plenty of real estate facilities as well. And then they have their own internal cost of creating Sun products, which they capitalize and use in their own business. And we're pretty disciplined about capital. So we treat capital investments, particularly for IT and we have very tight controls over that, far tighter than Sun has. So I would expect that to go down over time as well. Ken Bond Okay. And then if there's anybody who has not yet  Margaret [ph], why don't we go ahead and let Margaret ask the last question here? No problem. Margaret (inaudible) Ken Bond Margaret, let's just get the mic for the webcast. Thank you. Margaret Just about to that, does that mean that between, it sounds like your cash taxes are going to be lower than your tax rate. And working capital is going to be a source of cash for the next couple years. Does that mean free cash flow growth is going to be faster than earnings growth for the next two years? Jeff Epstein Well, I think that's true of taxes that we're going to get the benefit of that. I think in terms of the working capital, I guess I hadn't modeled it out exactly the way you're saying. But that's certainly a reasonable starting assumption. We certainly are very focused on our non-GAAP earnings but we also focus on cash. And I think we have a very disciplined approach at Oracle on our capital expenditures and our use of cash and our balance between receivables and payables. And I think we're going to bring that same discipline to Sun. And we publish our cash conversion ratio of what our net income is and what our free cash flow is. And we think that fundamentally we're in the business of generating free cash flow for our shareholders that we could either reinvest in R&D, we can pay out in dividends or a stock buyback or use for acquisitions. And we'll continue to have that disciplined approach. Ken Bond Well, we want to thank you all very much for coming. We know it's a very busy time. We know there's a lot of earnings activities going on right now. So thank you very much for coming today. We appreciate your participation. And we look forward to talk to you again. Thank you.

Total revenue was $1.221 billion at the high end of our guidance range and we saw year-over-year growth across all customer verticals. We delivered strong profitability metrics with year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating margin, operating income and diluted earnings per share. We believe we are benefiting from our diversification strategy and I'm pleased with our overall performance. We believe the biggest trend that is driving our industry and our strategy as a company today is the cloud. As the industry evolves, cloud architectures are no longer the exclusive domain of the cloud providers. Customers across all verticals are developing strategies for moving to cloud service delivery models and this aligns with our strategy to power the cloud transformation. I'm pleased with our year-over-year revenue growth of 25% in the Cloud vertical and would point out that our cloud solutions are addressing the cloud transformation across all of our key verticals. In the quarter, we continued to deliver on our innovation roadmap and announced two new solutions for the data center. In January, we announced Juniper Networks Unite Cloud, a transformative data center solution that gives enterprises a simplified way to create and manage hybrid multi-cloud environments. This solution delivers a secure and agile platform and is designed to reduce the total cost of ownership while increasing long-term return on our investments for our customers. At the OFC conference in March, we introduced our data center interconnect solution, Open Cloud Interconnect. This comprehensive DCI solution brings together our strength across packet and optical domains to enable a diverse range of network operators to accelerate cloud service delivery, while simplifying network operations. Earlier this year, we were delighted and honored to receive Vodafone Group's most prestigious award for Supplier of the Year. Juniper is a strategic provider of IP routing and security technology for Vodafone, specifically for next-generation data centers, IP/MPLS (sic) [IP/MLPS] (05:06) backbone and mobile backhaul domains. We believe that our continued strategy to lead in network innovation in key areas such as automation, software-defined networks, and network function virtualization will continue to enable our Telco customers to build new and innovative business models going forward. Now, I'd like to summarize highlights across switching, routing and security. In switching, we saw continued data center strength with our QFX products family, which once again grew over 50% year-over-year and continues to increase as a percentage of our overall switching portfolio mix. We are seeing continued traction in our QFX portfolio as customers across all verticals move to 100-gig, where we have industry-leading products. Our routing business grew year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of PTX revenue growth as well as modest growth in MX. We continued to see healthy demand for our newest generation of MX line cards, which had a record shipping quarter in Q1. Tremendous work has gone into the security product portfolio that we are very proud of. Juniper's differentiated SDSN strategy has been received very well by industry analysts and customers for its ability to detect and stop threats in a highly automated way. The innovative approach of viewing security as an open platform allows customers to leverage all existing security investments as well as their entire network infrastructure. At RSA, we announced new technology alliance partnerships with leading security providers that simplify deployment of Juniper's security solutions across several customer use cases. Our focus this year in security is on building confidence and momentum with our partners and customers. We believe we are making good progress as evidenced by new logo wins with our newest security products. Several global trials are also underway with managed service providers using Juniper's secure cloud managed enterprise solutions. We saw year-over-year growth in Contrail, and added several new customers in Q1, including a tier 1 operator in Europe. There was a continued expansion of orders within our existing customer base as they increased their deployment footprint. We saw continued strength in our overall services business, which grew 14% year-over-year. I am particularly pleased with the momentum we are seeing in our professional services business, where we had a strategic win at a tier 1 service provider in EMEA. To summarize, we are executing well in a competitive environment and are proud of the strength in our product and services portfolio. The cloud is a massive paradigm shift that is reshaping all industries, and I'm excited about the opportunity we have in front of us. Looking at the remainder of 2017, we expect overall demand to be seasonal and believe our customer diversification is positioning us for growth as we navigate through volatile markets. I want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I also want to extend a very big thank you to our employees for their commitment and hard work, which plays a significant role in successfully executing to our strategy and creating value for all of our stakeholders. With that said, I will turn the call over to Ken, who will review our quarterly financial results in more detail. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the March quarter reflects strong year-over-year revenue and earnings per share growth. From a revenue perspective, all verticals increased year-over-year led by Cloud, which increased 25%. We continued to see strong growth in our QFX product family, which grew over 50% year-over-year. We continued to see strength from our Services business, which grew 14% year-over-year driven by strong renewal and attach rates, as well as the recognition of previously deferred revenue from a telecom customer in Asia Pacific. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Telecom or Cable and one was a Strategic Enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. Non-GAAP gross margin was within our guided range for the quarter. While non-GAAP service gross margin was strong year-over-year, non-GAAP product gross margin declined 2.2 percentage points. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to customer mix as we expand our footprint with certain strategic APAC telecom and cloud customers as well as the product mix sold into our Cloud vertical. The decrease was partially offset by improvements in our cost structure and higher revenue volume. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $509 million, below our guided range for the quarter, reflecting our ongoing disciplined operating expense management. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to head count costs related to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2016 and higher variable compensation. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased $0.09 year-over-year, primarily driven by higher revenue. We had particularly strong cash flows from operations of $545 million, up $373 million year-over-year. The increase was driven by strong collections in the quarter, partially related to invoicing that occurred late last quarter. As expected, DSO rebounded and was 49 days. The reduction was primarily due to improved invoicing linearity this quarter. We continued to return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing $125 million of shares and paying $38 million in dividends during the first quarter. Now, I'd like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO Commentary available on our website. We remain committed to the financial principles we outlined last quarter. As a reminder, those principles are: we expect revenue growth for 2017; we are focused on earnings expansion with long-term consistency; and finally, we intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet and an optimized capital structure. Although elements of our markets are challenged, we expect to grow revenue this year. We are pleased with our product portfolio and expect to see continued strength from our Cloud vertical. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we anticipate gross margin levels similar to Q1 as we expect the customer and product mix dynamics to continue. Increased pricing for certain memory components could also present an additional headwind. We intend to drive earnings expansion this year through focused execution and operating expense discipline. We also intend to drive to our long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue this year, which is earlier than previously committed. We intend to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow to our shareholders inclusive of share repurchases and dividends. In closing, I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. And now the first question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First for Ken  sorry, for Rami, the switching business was strong. I was hoping you could help us understand the pipeline of opportunities you're seeing with the QFX buying offerings and given these products only became available over the last few quarters, is it reasonable to think, the business here could further strengthen as these opportunities mature? And then for Ken, I was hoping you could touch on the gross margin outlook. You previously talked about being comfortable with 63%. It looks like we'll be trending below that level for the year. Just wanted to understand if there's been a change in the competitive environment, what gives you confidence margins won't continue to deteriorate? And longer term, do you think we can get back to 63%, 64%? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Hi, Jess, it's Rami. Let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Ken. On the switching side, certainly, we're very pleased with the performance we saw in Q1. A big driver of that performance is in the data center and has a lot to do with the deliberate focused strategy that we've had on the data center, which certainly applies to the large cloud providers, but also other verticals as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Pretty much every one of our customer verticals now has a set of customers that's moving towards cloud architecture. The heart of that is the data center. We've always been in this space. We've always had a solution, but I would say that we've never had a solution that is this strong and that has the breadth of capabilities, both from a software standpoint, but also from an entire portfolio standpoint, the spine switches with the QFX10000 as well as the top-of-racks with the 5100, 5200s, et cetera. Do I believe that there will be continued momentum? Yes, we have, in our long-term model for this company's growth, been counting on and have provided you with color on where we see our switching business to come in. And that is going to continue to be a big growth driver for the company in the year and longer term. I will also point out that there's another element of our switching business, which is the EX product line and that is in the campus. And although the focus has been on the data center, we're really not taking our eye off the ball in the campus side. And in fact, we have this ability to leverage technologies that we have developed primarily for the data center. Think of our fabric technologies in innovative ways for the campus, and that is actually starting to help us provide some differentiation to our customers for larger campus environments. And for that reason, we actually saw some pretty good momentum in the EX business, which helped overall switching in the Q1 timeframe. With that, Ken, you want to talk a little bit about gross margins? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Sure, sure. So the gross margin landscape is very dynamic, as you know, Jess, and there are many factors that impact our gross margin. Clearly, you mentioned pricing. I would say the pricing environment is always challenging. We have not seen a broad-based change in that pricing environment. Really what's impacting us in Q1 and for our outlook is really product mix and customer mix. From a customer mix perspective, we are seeing some opportunity to grow with some strategic customers in telecom and cloud, both domestically and abroad, we're taking advantage of that opportunity. That does put some modest pressure on some of our gross margins. In addition to that from a product mix perspective, the strength that we are seeing in switching, which is ahead of our expectations, switching within the Cloud vertical in particular, does have some modest pressure on our margins as well. Last but not least, as it relates to our outlook, we are seeing some pricing pressure on memory. There are some memory components that are under pressure, and we expect that to be a factor for the rest of the year. From a long-term perspective, we remain focused on driving margin improvements. We continue to focus on our cost structure. As the software business picks up, we expect that to be a tailwind for our margins going forward. And obviously our biggest driver is continuing to deliver product innovation to market and monetize that innovation. The last thing I would say is while we are doing our best to maximize margin, we remain very focused on OpEx management and overall profitability. Our goal is to make sure that we have earnings expansion with long-term consistency, and that's what we're really focused on. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks, guys. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi. Thank you. I had a follow-up on each of the questions that was just asked. So first for Rami, thank you for disclosing the Cloud vertical. I did notice that there was a sequential decrease in your routing revenues in the Cloud vertical, and routing missed expectations. So curious if that's because some of those customers are transitioning to QFX when they would have previously used routers? And do you expect your routing business overall to grow with the Cloud vertical? And then for Ken on the gross margin question, you had cited price pressure in the last two quarters, and this quarter, that does not seem to have been a factor. So just wanted to see if that has in fact subsided. But on the flip side, when you're highlighting the cost supplier issue and DRAM prices, is that something you can quantify for us, just so we understand the incremental impact? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Hi, Simona. I will start with the follow up on routing and switching. And then I'll pass it over to Ken. So our routing businesses always depended on large deals, large customers across the Telco vertical and the Cloud vertical, and for that reason, it's always been lumpy and I think we're seeing some of that dynamic more broadly. Routing, as we all know now, as we have been talking about, we've sort of been predicting, is essentially a flattish type of overall market opportunity for Juniper and for our peers in this industry. We think that we can compete in that environment by taking some modest market share with really competitive products. That's true for Telco, for the Enterprise, for Cloud, for Cable and all of our strategic verticals. That's what's happening really in the cloud space as well, where a lot of the growth is coming in from in the cloud providers, is in switching today. And we're clearly taking more than our fair share there. I think the question underlying the question that you're asking is, is there some sort of a transition that's happening where architectures are moving from routing to switching and so on. The way I view it is that each of our key product sets, whether it be the MX for programmable routing, the PTX for really lean, core transport-oriented routing and the QFX for switching opportunities, they have a sweet spot. One is really targeted for the edge. One is for wide area. One is more for the data center. But even there, what happens is that the line starts to blur, and there will be some shifting, if you will, on the sort of the edges of the use cases between each of these products. But those sweet spots continue to be very important and something that our customers largely respect. There will always be some level of cannibalization, but for the most part, I think the opportunity, in aggregate, with these three technologies under our belt is a growing opportunity. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. From a pricing perspective, Simona, the pricing environment is always a challenging environment, it has been for many, many years in this space. What I mentioned is we didn't see any specific broad-based deterioration beyond what we expected. We always expect pricing pressure, and it largely came in as we expected this quarter. But what we did see though were some strategic selling insertion opportunities. I mentioned customer mix. We are definitely getting strategic in some of the international customers in particular in the telecom and cloud space and these are customers that we are very deliberate with in regard to these deals and we do expect margin to improve over time as our footprint expands. So that does have a pricing impact, but again, it's at a very specific customer level. On the cost of memory side, it is a factor  really the three factors I've mentioned, the customer mix, the product mix and the cost of memory, all relatively weighted pretty evenly as far as our margin guidance of 62.5%, which I believe is still a pretty healthy margin guidance for the year. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi guys. I have a question on security and question on dividends. Starting with the dividends, you grow faster than Cisco. You take share in key markets. You generate very healthy cash flow. But your dividend yield is half that of Cisco and the price discount -- the stock is trading at 20% discount to Cisco because of that. What's your philosophy, what's your strategy about dividend and an increase in the dividend yield? That's the first question. The second question is about security. You have products and new dynamics, but the revenues were down 10% for the year  year-over-year, can you discuss the outlook for 2017? What are the ups and downs? What are the puts and takes in security growth? And when do you see the inflection point of turning from declines to growth? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Thanks, Tal. Let me start and I'll start with the security question. And then I'll pass it on to Ken to talk a little bit about dividends and the dividend strategy. Well the first, there has been, and there continues to be a tremendous amount of work that's happening inside of Juniper to increase the competitiveness of our products overall, the solutions and security, the feature releases and the new code drops that we're making now are coming out on a very regular basis. And the things that gives me the confidence in our ability to stabilize and then recover and then grow this part of our business is the fact that when I look at key metrics, like the performance of new products with the newer capabilities that we have introduced into the market over the last, let's say, six to nine months, there's growth there. There is in fact momentum. The feedback from our partners, our customers is positive. And there is in fact sales achievement and revenue growth that we are seeing in that part of the business. It's just not fast enough to offset the decline in some of the older products. So eventually, I think the math starts to work in our favor. We need a little bit of patience and a lot more of the very hard work that I know that is going across the entire company right now to get this back to stability and then to growth. And I expect in the second half of the year that we can get to growth. I will just point out that the big part of the focused effort right now is on rebuilding confidence, rebuilding the channel and of course, one win at a time, including new logos that we have just gotten in the Q1 timeframe. I think we can get this back on track. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. And as we previously committed to, the 50% of free cash flow is what we're comfortable with for this year. That would be inclusive of both share repurchases and dividends. And we'll look to be opportunistic with our share buyback programs throughout the year. That said, we're always looking to optimize our capital structure, and we will reevaluate things as things change. For example, our financial performance, our cash needs, as well as our valuation will all be factors into some reevaluation of our capital return program. In addition, we've obviously paid attention to what's going on with the new administration with tax repatriation and/or tax changes. So those could be other factors that we'll have to consider when and if they come to fruition. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thanks. Just one question will be on (25:51) this year. For the verticals you are talking about; the Cloud, the Telco and Cable, and Enterprise, can you speak about any trends we should be aware of? For example, could the cloud business start facing difficult compares and start to decelerate? Is that something we should think about at some point as we start exiting maybe 2017? And then on the Telco side, I think it was better than we thought. Can you just give us some details behind what drove that in Q1? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Hi, Kulbinder, it's Rami. So let me start. First of all, I think the most important thing here is diversification. It's not just about Cloud, it's not just about Telco. It's really about broadening and making sure that we are diversified really along three dimensions: first is in the technologies, so it's Routing, Switching, Security; second is in the Telcos and  sorry, the verticals; Telcos and Cloud and so forth; and then also it's about geo. So, for example, we're starting to see good momentum or early momentum with the cloud providers in Europe. We're starting to see also early momentum with the cloud providers in Asia Pacific. So that diversification strategy has paid off well for us in the last couple of years and I expect it to continue to pay off well for us. Any one of these verticals is going to be lumpy. Right? I just mentioned, for example, Routing has always been somewhat lumpy as it pertains to the Cloud vertical or the Telco vertical, and I would expect that to remain the same going forward. Anything you want to add, Ken, to that? Okay. Thanks for the question. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Instinet. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC Yes. Thanks very much. A question and a clarification. I think in the past you all have talked about 3% to 6% revenue growth as a CAGR. I'm wondering if that sort of applies to this year? And if so, what are the puts and takes to the low and high-end of that range? And then secondly, Ken, at one point, you had sort of passed on a chance to endorse 63% as a longer-term model, but then you said you think some of the new contracts that you've won in Asia and in cloud will grow the margins over time. So I'm wondering if we can pin you down a little bit on that long-term model. Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. The gross margin? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yes. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc. First, yeah, the revenue... Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. So let's talk about revenue first, and I'll talk about the numbers and then, Rami, maybe you could talk about what would put us on the high-end, low-end of that range. So at this point, based on what we see today, we are comfortable with the 3% to 6%, which is our long-term model. In fact, I would say we're comfortable with kind of the midpoint of that range for this year. So that's really the numbers we're looking at for this year. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. As far as overachievement or underachievement, clearly we're seeing a lot of strength in the cloud space as well as in the switching business. Telco and routing remains a challenging market, and we think that it will be relatively flattish for us and maybe some modest growth in that sector and those technologies. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. From a gross margin, again, I mean it's dynamic. Five-tenths of a margin point is difficult to get right every quarter. I do think that we have some lumpiness in revenue as well as margins ahead. Customer mix and product mix will be up and down. The Q1 result was very much in line with our expectations and the guidance we put out there. I do think the 63% for the year is not out of the question. However, I think it's prudent for us to plan the P&L and focus on earnings growth even with margin headwinds continuing. So that's really what we're basing a lot of our guidance on now. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. I want to just add to that. I completely agree with everything Ken just said. When you're operating in an environment where your customer mix is changing, the technology mix is changing, we're seeing a geo mix change as well, and in certain strategic initiatives like penetration to the cloud we're even ahead of where we expect it to be right now. Predicting gross margins can be somewhat tricky. With that said, there are a number of activities across the company right now all focused on improving gross margins. And we're running the business, as Ken just mentioned, with the assumptions that current levels are going to be here for a while, just in case. So that's I think the way that you should think about how we're running the business and the dynamics of the industry that we operate in right now and our strategy as it pertains to those dynamics. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Nicholas Rodney Hall - JPMorgan Securities Plc Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to just check on cloud revenue. You guys had said I think your target was 24% of company revenue by 2019, and obviously you've blown through that, assuming it's the same basis that we're talking about. So is it the same basis, I guess? And then if it is, what sort of longer-term target do you have for a proportion of the company revenue given the trajectory? And then along the same lines, could you talk about that cloud revenue this year? The disclosure shows it sequentially increasing every quarter last year. Is that likely to be the case again this year? Can you just kind of help us understand what you expect from the trajectory there? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yes, Rod, let me start, and I'll start with the second question, and then Ken can talk a little bit about the baseline. I know because we've now just re-categorized how we're reporting our numbers, so a little bit of expectation will probably be helpful. Will there be consistent, sequential growth throughout the year in any vertical? Honestly, it's very difficult to predict that because all of our verticals, Cloud included, is going to be lumpy. The fact that we are now in both Routing and Switching in any one vertical, Security to a lesser extent, but Routing and Switching, helps to offset some of that lumpiness. But I expect that the lumpiness will exist and will remain in effect. The good news is I still feel very good about our ability to compete in the Cloud vertical. How close we are to our customers in the Cloud vertical, our ability to understand their requirements, their architecture, and the kinds of innovation that we need to put in place to participate in the Cloud vertical, and on all those counts I feel very good. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. And as it relates to our baseline, you have the numbers right. So we disclosed 19%, moving to 24% of our revenue. That would be a growth rate of 10% to 13%. We did recast the verticals, and the Cloud vertical actually is now up a couple points. So actually the 19% turns to 21% of our business in 2015 with cloud. So the target would move up a couple points as well to 26% of our business. Growth rate targets remain the same. However, we are seeing higher pickup in the cloud than we expected, so we're clearly outpacing those growth rates at this point in the model. Nicholas Rodney Hall - JPMorgan Securities Plc Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. And I hate to follow-up on another cloud question. But as we're now focused on that vertical, and we can see the dynamics separately in your results, I'm curious if you could help us understand the concentration or the diversification rather of your customer base within that vertical and how you would characterize your visibility in that vertical relative to your traditional service provider or Enterprise vertical? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. We can talk about the cloud all day long, because it really is such an important vertical for us, and it's a very deliberate part of our strategy, so no problem at all, Aaron. First, when you think about the cloud opportunity, I want to emphasize again that it really touches every vertical that I'm talking about the cloud opportunity all up. There are certainly those that were born in the cloud, the large cloud providers. There are those that have aspiration to become cloud providers. Think of the telcos and the cable operators that are now re-architecting their networks to deliver cloud services. And then there are those enterprises that see the value in moving workloads and applications to the cloud. All of these are an element of our cloud strategy. The way in which we approach each can vary a little bit. So, for example, our large cloud provider customers have an ability to do a lot of the software developments on their own, but then we developed really innovative technologies like Contrail, our SDN controller, to essentially help automate and secure cloud for the enterprise and for the telco and cable space. That's just to say that all of these verticals really apply. Now if the question is specifically around, sort of, our ability to predict the performance, our performance in the cloud provider vertical itself, I think any one quarter, a quarter here and there you're going to see lumpiness, you're going to see variations in the performance just based on their appetite to spend and where they are in certain projects and certain deployments. But generally speaking, when we talk to them, when we see industry reports, when we understand their own plans, and when we see their own performance, I mean, you see how they are performing in their respective markets, we feel good about the fact that they will continue to rely on networks as a foundation of their business, and we also feel good about our ability to satisfy their networking requirements. It's a very competitive environment, but I feel very confident in our technology. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you very much. The majority of the Q&A has been focused on the products and the new segments, which is fair. Now that we're getting towards the end of the conference call, could you touch briefly on Security? I don't think I heard it mentioned how should we view the Security segment within Juniper and kind of the trajectory, it's been kind of a rough last year in Security division when we look about year-over-year growth. Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Sure, Jim. So, I did mention earlier the fact that Security right now, there's quite a lot of effort that has gone into improving our products, making them competitive, differentiating in the solutions that we offer to our customers. And I think we're seeing very good momentum specifically in the newer technologies and solutions we've introduced into the market. I mentioned the fact that there is a concerted effort right now in terms of go-to-market, marketing, rebuilding our channels, and rebuilding confidence in our customers and our partners' mind where we have quite frankly lost some of that confidence. That's where the effort is. The only additional thing I will say is that there are really strong synergies between Security and the rest of our portfolio. So synergies are on the cost side where we tend to leverage a lot of the software development as well as the silicon technology across Routing and Switching into Security, and increasingly we're seeing actually very solid revenue synergies. If you think about what our SDSN, software-defined secure network, strategy is all about, it's about enabling our customers to use their network infrastructure in an intelligent way to provide a secure fabric, a very secure fabric to prevent essentially their infrastructure, their data, their workloads from being compromised. That is essentially enabling us to sell Security along with Routing and Switching in the data center or in the campus. So I mean that's the other really important element of how we're approaching Security that I think is important for you to understand. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. And my follow-up, the turnaround for the sustainable revenue growth, you mentioned a lot of effort into it. When shall we see the fruit of those efforts start to bear? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. So I think that we're in the process of stabilizing right now. The newer products are growing. The older products are declining. The math is not working for overall growth. This year I think is going to be a critical year for us as we get back to stability and growth probably in the latter half of the year. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you very much for the details. Greatly appreciated. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. You're welcome. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah, thanks. Yeah. Hi, Rami, Ken. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Hello. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Hi, Vijay. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah, hi. I have a bigger-picture question, Rami, which is Juniper and Arista are comparable in market cap now. I mean my view is how would you benchmark productivity per employee versus your peers such as Arista who have significantly lower head count versus Juniper. And then also any thoughts on exiting underperforming areas such as Security to just improve overall fundamentals, better allocate resources to the more productive product portfolio? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Well, Vijay, I mean I'll just say that we understand that we operate in a competitive environment. We have competitors that are larger. We have competitors that are smaller than us. The key to our success is to focus, and if you look at what we have done over the last couple of years, there has been an incredible amount of effort put into streamlining our business, pruning our product portfolio to areas where we know that we can invest to compete effectively, and I think we're demonstrating our ability to do just that. The new products that we have now delivered into the market space, especially in the domain of the PTX routing, in our QFX switching, in the new MX line-cards that we have introduced are all essentially doing as we expected. They're growing nicely across our key verticals, and that's what you can expect more from us in the future. I think there was a second part of the question that I've now forgotten. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah. The second part of the question was, any thoughts on exiting underperforming areas such as Security and then pouring the resource into product portfolios that are selling in the market? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. I appreciate that question. Of course, I have to always, as CEO of this company evaluate the performance of any one of our products, technology areas, and businesses. I would just say that as it pertains to Security, which is I think what your question is about, the focus at this period of time is on turning around this business. The data points that we're getting from our customers, our partners are all very positive at this point, and the synergies are really good. The cost synergies and our ability to leverage technology actually enabled us to achieve: A, differentiation; and very solid efficiency in how we develop the technology that's underlying Security. And then there is the revenue synergies on top of that. So that's how I'm thinking about it right now. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you. Maybe we could touch on the services business for a minute and talk a little bit. It sounds like renewal and attach rates have been pretty strong for last few quarters here. Understanding it was a catch-up in the quarter. But could you just talk a little bit about sustainability of the success there? Can we expect this to keep kind of outgrowing products? And then also related to that, how we should think about gross margin leverage as that business continues to grow? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yes. Thanks for the question. So the service business continues to be a highlight for us. It's a very healthy business for us. On the revenue side, the key is what you mentioned, the attach rates, the renewal rates, and the focus there over the past several quarters is really starting to pay off as we're seeing the revenue growth consistently do well. As you mentioned, we did benefit this quarter from approximately $15 million of revenue that came off of the balance sheet. So you have to factor that in as you start thinking about the rest of the year. But I do expect Security after you normalize  I'm sorry, services, after you normalize for that $15 million, to be up quarter-on-quarter kind of back to our sequential patterns that we normally see in this business. From a longevity perspective, I would expect services to outpace product but not to the same degree that it has over the last several quarters. It will eventually start to normalize closer together on the growth rate perspective. Gross margin wise, numbers we've been posting lately, the 63% to 64% is really what we're focused on going forward. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc. Next question, please. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Jayson Noland of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay, great. Thank you. Ken, just a housekeeping, book-to-bill if you haven't given it. And then a broader question on Security. Rami, if you could  press release cites some weakness in high-end SRX. If you could talk about that a little bit and then the opportunity in virtual SRX it looks like you put some marketing dollars behind that recently. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jayson. Let me start with that and then I'll pass it on to you, Ken. The high-end SRX it addresses a market opportunity that's primarily geared towards telecom providers, especially in the mobile space. And that part of the business is just going to be lumpy. It's going to have fluctuation depending on build outs for typically Tier 1 service providers. The other thing is we have not yet refreshed that part of our portfolio for some time, but we're working on a roadmap to do so that I think will eventually contribute to that business. The virtual SRX, I mean that's a that's an example of how we think about our strategy on a couple of different time horizons. There is the here and now and how our customers are typically building out their security posture today. And then there is what we expect in the future. Clearly, as the perimeter around the enterprise disappears, as workloads and applications moves to the cloud, the security architectures evolve and virtual security offerings become far more important. And we actually have a really differentiated virtual security solution  the virtual SRX that is in the market, that is gaining good traction, but it's still a small market opportunity for this period of time. It's an example of innovation that, we believe, will help us in the second horizon of our strategy in the sort of two, three, four, five year timeframe. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. On the book-to-bill question as our business continues to evolve, and preferred revenue (45:33) grows over time, we believe the commentary around preferred revenue (45:34) is a more meaningful demand metric. So we decided not to disclose book-to-bill any more on a quarterly basis. We will be disclosing backlog on an annual basis going forward in addition to the deferred revenue details. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay. Thanks guys. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc. And as we said, Jayson, that's in line with our peers in terms of that book-to-bill metric, disclosing that metric. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great, thank you. Couple of things I want to ask. One is, in the release, you talk about, I guess, some problems you had with a particular product and some COGS reversals. Could you elaborate a little bit on what happened there, and whether or not that affected any revenue, whether it caused any delays, and how you're remediating that in terms of timing? And then the thing I was trying to understand and back to the cloud, I'm wondering if your cloud vertical has a similar mix, or how the mix compares relative to your overall in terms of percent of revenue coming from Routing, Switching and Security? How does that mix look for the cloud vertical in particular? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Well, let me start with the second one, and Ken, you might need to help me with this one. Switching versus Routing mix in the cloud. Now we know that, like I have mentioned I think a couple of times on this call, the business is going to be lumpy. And it's going to be lumpy both in Switching and in Routing. A lot of the growth in the Q1 timeframe for example in the cloud vertical came in Switching. But in the past, there were quarters were it has actually come in more in the Routing. In terms of mix, I don't know if we provided that detail. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. So historically, what we talked about is the cloud vertical mix was largely in line with the Juniper overall mix. So Routing, Switching, Security as Juniper goes, the cloud vertical is largely moving that. As we're seeing more success in Switching, we are seeing some of that mix shift towards Switching faster in that vertical than some of the other verticals. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. I believe that you are referring to... Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. I'm sorry, on the cost, the cost COGS, cost of goods sold information, sorry, on the GAAP results, I think you're talking about a supplier component remediation cost that we had, and it actually started in Q4. We are working with our customers and a third-party supplier. There are certain products we have a clock signal component defect. This is kind of an industry-wide fairly well known situation. We did take a charge in Q4 and we trued up that charge this quarter. We do believe we're handling it very effectively with our customer base and managing through this situation. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. And has that affected your revenue at all? Have you pushed out any sales because of that? That was what I was trying to get at? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. No, no. It did not have an impact on revenue. It's really more about a proactive approach we're taking to make sure it doesn't have an impact on customers from a quality perspective. We have not seen any actual quality issues to date, but we want to make sure we avoid those going forward and it has not had any impact on revenue. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thanks for the clarification. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Sure. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. You're welcome. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just kind of wondering on kind of the QFX family, I know it was up 50% this quarter year-over-year. How do we think about the refresh cycle there? And how long should this kind of outsized growth last? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah, thanks for the question, Mitch. It's honestly very difficult to answer the question, just because the volume of customers that we now have that are buying QFXs from us across all verticals is very large. And I don't know if you can really put any patterns to it. The one pattern sort of out there is just the 100-gig option. Where there are large data center deployments that require 100-gig connectivity, that's where Juniper just differentiates even more. This is where the density of our products, our Routing stack, the logical scale of our QFX technology starts to really stand out. And for that reason, if you look at our Switching growth, especially as it pertains to the data center over the last few years, it has been quite good. Now if you narrow your analysis and you look specifically on market share in the over 10-gig connectivity space, there we're taking market share even faster. And that's just again because of the fact that where there are high-performance networking problems to be solved, we tend to just stand out among our peers in the industry. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC Got it. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Please go ahead. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc. Yes. Thanks, good afternoon. I just had a quick clarification here, did you guys comment on the cloud with respect to, is it accretive to the model from a gross margin or operating margin perspective? Just kind of curious if gross margin is lower, but maybe on the operating margin side is better? And then my actual question is, Rami, I want to get a sense here just given the greater transparency around the cloud business and the better momentum, is this why back in early March, you announced the expanded organizational focus related to R&D with Kevin and Andy? Does this really mean you need to have a little more focus in terms of servicing your legacy customers, but also your cloud customers from a technology roadmap perspective longer term? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah, sure. Let me start on the organizational piece. I don't think I would view this from the standpoint of it being specific to any one vertical. I just reached the conclusion that having a flatter organization will result in an ability to execute with more consistency, to move faster with fewer layers in the organization to address what is a very dynamic market opportunity. As it pertains to the cloud providers themselves, we have sort of understood the recipe for how to succeed there for quite a long period of time, where it really has to be an engagement model that is at the engineer-to-engineer level. We are connected with them on a first name basis down throughout the entire organization. And that's really what's required to achieve the necessary understanding of the direction of their architecture and what has enabled us to be successful. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. And from a cloud vertical margin perspective, I would just state that from a gross margin perspective the primary driver within the cloud vertical will be product mix, not the cloud vertical itself. So as it shifts more towards Switching which is what we're seeing now and what we kind of expect to see for the rest of the year that would have a detriment to the telco vertical as an example which is predominantly Routing. But it's not because of the customer itself, it's really more the product mix going into that vertical. From an operating margin perspective, we really don't take the operating margin down to vertical. Most of our cost, most of our OpEx is really shared across all our verticals, we don't segregate it between vertical. So you would see the same  if you were to allocate it out, you would see a similar profile in the op margin as you would on the gross margin, because everything else would be relatively equally and revenue proportionate. I would say, although it is, as the shifts to Switching, you're seeing some margin pressure there, it's very healthy margins. We're very comfortable with the cloud vertical and the mix within the cloud vertical, and in fact that we are ahead of schedule in some of our transitions into the high performance Switching into that vertical, and that's really a good thing overall. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc. Okay. Next question? Operator Thank you. Our final question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you for taking my question. What (53:56) answer couple of longer term strategic questions. First, how do you think about  back to a question Simona asked earlier on the call about the ability to choose between Switching and Routing. How do you think about the opportunity for things like virtual routing et cetera and how does that impact your business strategy (54:17). And then second thing is, in terms use of capital, where does your acquisition strategy stand today, or how does that fit within your use of capital. And then my last question, just on operating expenses, obviously, you continue to control those very well. How should we think about the development of OpEx going forward? Thank you very much. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Thanks James. Your voice was kind of choppy, so I hope that I got the questions all correctly. You can tell me if I didn't. First in the virtual routing, and I'll extend that to include virtual routing, virtual security. There is certainly an element of the networking industry all up that can be addressed with virtual technologies as opposed to just hardware. Typically, these are going to be more service oriented. They're going to be at the edge of the network. It's very difficult to solve a large core opportunity or a data center spine opportunity with just software or just virtual products. And that obviously is where Juniper has excelled historically. It's where our differentiation mostly has existed in the past. Having said that, as the world moves towards cloud architectures and our customers have the ability to deliver services using a cloud service delivery model that presents an opportunity for us to start to offer virtual versions of our products, like virtual security being an example of that. It's typically going to be for more scale out type of applications, think of the CPE space where the physical CPE business has generally been a small revenue generator for Juniper. Now as the industry transitions to a virtual equivalent model to the CPE space, we view this in fact as a great opportunity for us to go and to participate in. And from an M&A standpoint, no new news there other than we continue to look at M&A strategically as a way of accelerating the strategies that we have talked to you about in the past and we're executing on today. So we're not looking at this to get into adjacent markets. We want to look at this from the standpoint of really accelerating a strategy that we are operating in today. And then last, but not least, is on the operational expenditures, Ken, I'll let you close on that. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. So we're very pleased with our Q1 OpEx results which came in below the guidance despite the annual reset of variable compensation and kind of typical seasonal patterns in fringe costs. We're very, very happy with our performance. We are targeting 39% of OpEx as a percentage of revenue for the year, which is in line with our long-term target, but actually ahead of schedule. So we're also very pleased with that OpEx discipline going forward. We're always looking to drive efficiencies, but it's beyond efficiencies. We're also looking to make sure we align our workforce to our long-term strategy and make sure that we're able to deliver growth going forward as well. So we believe we could accomplish all of those objectives of keeping expansion in mind throughout the way. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC You guys got them all. Sorry about the bad connection. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. No problem. Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc. Okay. Thanks, James. And unfortunately, that is all the time we have today. We'd like to thank each of you for your participation, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator Thank you.

We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. And now the first question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First for Ken  sorry, for Rami, the switching business was strong. I was hoping you could help us understand the pipeline of opportunities you're seeing with the QFX buying offerings and given these products only became available over the last few quarters, is it reasonable to think, the business here could further strengthen as these opportunities mature? And then for Ken, I was hoping you could touch on the gross margin outlook. You previously talked about being comfortable with 63%. It looks like we'll be trending below that level for the year. Just wanted to understand if there's been a change in the competitive environment, what gives you confidence margins won't continue to deteriorate? And longer term, do you think we can get back to 63%, 64%? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Hi, Jess, it's Rami. Let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Ken. On the switching side, certainly, we're very pleased with the performance we saw in Q1. A big driver of that performance is in the data center and has a lot to do with the deliberate focused strategy that we've had on the data center, which certainly applies to the large cloud providers, but also other verticals as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Pretty much every one of our customer verticals now has a set of customers that's moving towards cloud architecture. The heart of that is the data center. We've always been in this space. We've always had a solution, but I would say that we've never had a solution that is this strong and that has the breadth of capabilities, both from a software standpoint, but also from an entire portfolio standpoint, the spine switches with the QFX10000 as well as the top-of-racks with the 5100, 5200s, et cetera. Do I believe that there will be continued momentum? Yes, we have, in our long-term model for this company's growth, been counting on and have provided you with color on where we see our switching business to come in. And that is going to continue to be a big growth driver for the company in the year and longer term. I will also point out that there's another element of our switching business, which is the EX product line and that is in the campus. And although the focus has been on the data center, we're really not taking our eye off the ball in the campus side. And in fact, we have this ability to leverage technologies that we have developed primarily for the data center. Think of our fabric technologies in innovative ways for the campus, and that is actually starting to help us provide some differentiation to our customers for larger campus environments. And for that reason, we actually saw some pretty good momentum in the EX business, which helped overall switching in the Q1 timeframe. With that, Ken, you want to talk a little bit about gross margins? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Sure, sure. So the gross margin landscape is very dynamic, as you know, Jess, and there are many factors that impact our gross margin. Clearly, you mentioned pricing. I would say the pricing environment is always challenging. We have not seen a broad-based change in that pricing environment. Really what's impacting us in Q1 and for our outlook is really product mix and customer mix. From a customer mix perspective, we are seeing some opportunity to grow with some strategic customers in telecom and cloud, both domestically and abroad, we're taking advantage of that opportunity. That does put some modest pressure on some of our gross margins. In addition to that from a product mix perspective, the strength that we are seeing in switching, which is ahead of our expectations, switching within the Cloud vertical in particular, does have some modest pressure on our margins as well. Last but not least, as it relates to our outlook, we are seeing some pricing pressure on memory. There are some memory components that are under pressure, and we expect that to be a factor for the rest of the year. From a long-term perspective, we remain focused on driving margin improvements. We continue to focus on our cost structure. As the software business picks up, we expect that to be a tailwind for our margins going forward. And obviously our biggest driver is continuing to deliver product innovation to market and monetize that innovation. The last thing I would say is while we are doing our best to maximize margin, we remain very focused on OpEx management and overall profitability. Our goal is to make sure that we have earnings expansion with long-term consistency, and that's what we're really focused on. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks, guys. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi. Thank you. I had a follow-up on each of the questions that was just asked. So first for Rami, thank you for disclosing the Cloud vertical. I did notice that there was a sequential decrease in your routing revenues in the Cloud vertical, and routing missed expectations. So curious if that's because some of those customers are transitioning to QFX when they would have previously used routers? And do you expect your routing business overall to grow with the Cloud vertical? And then for Ken on the gross margin question, you had cited price pressure in the last two quarters, and this quarter, that does not seem to have been a factor. So just wanted to see if that has in fact subsided. But on the flip side, when you're highlighting the cost supplier issue and DRAM prices, is that something you can quantify for us, just so we understand the incremental impact? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Hi, Simona. I will start with the follow up on routing and switching. And then I'll pass it over to Ken. So our routing businesses always depended on large deals, large customers across the Telco vertical and the Cloud vertical, and for that reason, it's always been lumpy and I think we're seeing some of that dynamic more broadly. Routing, as we all know now, as we have been talking about, we've sort of been predicting, is essentially a flattish type of overall market opportunity for Juniper and for our peers in this industry. We think that we can compete in that environment by taking some modest market share with really competitive products. That's true for Telco, for the Enterprise, for Cloud, for Cable and all of our strategic verticals. That's what's happening really in the cloud space as well, where a lot of the growth is coming in from in the cloud providers, is in switching today. And we're clearly taking more than our fair share there. I think the question underlying the question that you're asking is, is there some sort of a transition that's happening where architectures are moving from routing to switching and so on. The way I view it is that each of our key product sets, whether it be the MX for programmable routing, the PTX for really lean, core transport-oriented routing and the QFX for switching opportunities, they have a sweet spot. One is really targeted for the edge. One is for wide area. One is more for the data center. But even there, what happens is that the line starts to blur, and there will be some shifting, if you will, on the sort of the edges of the use cases between each of these products. But those sweet spots continue to be very important and something that our customers largely respect. There will always be some level of cannibalization, but for the most part, I think the opportunity, in aggregate, with these three technologies under our belt is a growing opportunity. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. From a pricing perspective, Simona, the pricing environment is always a challenging environment, it has been for many, many years in this space. What I mentioned is we didn't see any specific broad-based deterioration beyond what we expected. We always expect pricing pressure, and it largely came in as we expected this quarter. But what we did see though were some strategic selling insertion opportunities. I mentioned customer mix. We are definitely getting strategic in some of the international customers in particular in the telecom and cloud space and these are customers that we are very deliberate with in regard to these deals and we do expect margin to improve over time as our footprint expands. So that does have a pricing impact, but again, it's at a very specific customer level. On the cost of memory side, it is a factor  really the three factors I've mentioned, the customer mix, the product mix and the cost of memory, all relatively weighted pretty evenly as far as our margin guidance of 62.5%, which I believe is still a pretty healthy margin guidance for the year. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi guys. I have a question on security and question on dividends. Starting with the dividends, you grow faster than Cisco. You take share in key markets. You generate very healthy cash flow. But your dividend yield is half that of Cisco and the price discount -- the stock is trading at 20% discount to Cisco because of that. What's your philosophy, what's your strategy about dividend and an increase in the dividend yield? That's the first question. The second question is about security. You have products and new dynamics, but the revenues were down 10% for the year  year-over-year, can you discuss the outlook for 2017? What are the ups and downs? What are the puts and takes in security growth? And when do you see the inflection point of turning from declines to growth? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Thanks, Tal. Let me start and I'll start with the security question. And then I'll pass it on to Ken to talk a little bit about dividends and the dividend strategy. Well the first, there has been, and there continues to be a tremendous amount of work that's happening inside of Juniper to increase the competitiveness of our products overall, the solutions and security, the feature releases and the new code drops that we're making now are coming out on a very regular basis. And the things that gives me the confidence in our ability to stabilize and then recover and then grow this part of our business is the fact that when I look at key metrics, like the performance of new products with the newer capabilities that we have introduced into the market over the last, let's say, six to nine months, there's growth there. There is in fact momentum. The feedback from our partners, our customers is positive. And there is in fact sales achievement and revenue growth that we are seeing in that part of the business. It's just not fast enough to offset the decline in some of the older products. So eventually, I think the math starts to work in our favor. We need a little bit of patience and a lot more of the very hard work that I know that is going across the entire company right now to get this back to stability and then to growth. And I expect in the second half of the year that we can get to growth. I will just point out that the big part of the focused effort right now is on rebuilding confidence, rebuilding the channel and of course, one win at a time, including new logos that we have just gotten in the Q1 timeframe. I think we can get this back on track. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. And as we previously committed to, the 50% of free cash flow is what we're comfortable with for this year. That would be inclusive of both share repurchases and dividends. And we'll look to be opportunistic with our share buyback programs throughout the year. That said, we're always looking to optimize our capital structure, and we will reevaluate things as things change. For example, our financial performance, our cash needs, as well as our valuation will all be factors into some reevaluation of our capital return program. In addition, we've obviously paid attention to what's going on with the new administration with tax repatriation and/or tax changes. So those could be other factors that we'll have to consider when and if they come to fruition. Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thanks. Just one question will be on (25:51) this year. For the verticals you are talking about; the Cloud, the Telco and Cable, and Enterprise, can you speak about any trends we should be aware of? For example, could the cloud business start facing difficult compares and start to decelerate? Is that something we should think about at some point as we start exiting maybe 2017? And then on the Telco side, I think it was better than we thought. Can you just give us some details behind what drove that in Q1? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Hi, Kulbinder, it's Rami. So let me start. First of all, I think the most important thing here is diversification. It's not just about Cloud, it's not just about Telco. It's really about broadening and making sure that we are diversified really along three dimensions: first is in the technologies, so it's Routing, Switching, Security; second is in the Telcos and  sorry, the verticals; Telcos and Cloud and so forth; and then also it's about geo. So, for example, we're starting to see good momentum or early momentum with the cloud providers in Europe. We're starting to see also early momentum with the cloud providers in Asia Pacific. So that diversification strategy has paid off well for us in the last couple of years and I expect it to continue to pay off well for us. Any one of these verticals is going to be lumpy. Right? I just mentioned, for example, Routing has always been somewhat lumpy as it pertains to the Cloud vertical or the Telco vertical, and I would expect that to remain the same going forward. Anything you want to add, Ken, to that? Okay. Thanks for the question. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Instinet. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC Yes. Thanks very much. A question and a clarification. I think in the past you all have talked about 3% to 6% revenue growth as a CAGR. I'm wondering if that sort of applies to this year? And if so, what are the puts and takes to the low and high-end of that range? And then secondly, Ken, at one point, you had sort of passed on a chance to endorse 63% as a longer-term model, but then you said you think some of the new contracts that you've won in Asia and in cloud will grow the margins over time. So I'm wondering if we can pin you down a little bit on that long-term model. Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. The gross margin? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yes. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc. First, yeah, the revenue... Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. So let's talk about revenue first, and I'll talk about the numbers and then, Rami, maybe you could talk about what would put us on the high-end, low-end of that range. So at this point, based on what we see today, we are comfortable with the 3% to 6%, which is our long-term model. In fact, I would say we're comfortable with kind of the midpoint of that range for this year. So that's really the numbers we're looking at for this year. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. As far as overachievement or underachievement, clearly we're seeing a lot of strength in the cloud space as well as in the switching business. Telco and routing remains a challenging market, and we think that it will be relatively flattish for us and maybe some modest growth in that sector and those technologies. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. From a gross margin, again, I mean it's dynamic. Five-tenths of a margin point is difficult to get right every quarter. I do think that we have some lumpiness in revenue as well as margins ahead. Customer mix and product mix will be up and down. The Q1 result was very much in line with our expectations and the guidance we put out there. I do think the 63% for the year is not out of the question. However, I think it's prudent for us to plan the P&L and focus on earnings growth even with margin headwinds continuing. So that's really what we're basing a lot of our guidance on now. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. I want to just add to that. I completely agree with everything Ken just said. When you're operating in an environment where your customer mix is changing, the technology mix is changing, we're seeing a geo mix change as well, and in certain strategic initiatives like penetration to the cloud we're even ahead of where we expect it to be right now. Predicting gross margins can be somewhat tricky. With that said, there are a number of activities across the company right now all focused on improving gross margins. And we're running the business, as Ken just mentioned, with the assumptions that current levels are going to be here for a while, just in case. So that's I think the way that you should think about how we're running the business and the dynamics of the industry that we operate in right now and our strategy as it pertains to those dynamics. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Nicholas Rodney Hall - JPMorgan Securities Plc Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to just check on cloud revenue. You guys had said I think your target was 24% of company revenue by 2019, and obviously you've blown through that, assuming it's the same basis that we're talking about. So is it the same basis, I guess? And then if it is, what sort of longer-term target do you have for a proportion of the company revenue given the trajectory? And then along the same lines, could you talk about that cloud revenue this year? The disclosure shows it sequentially increasing every quarter last year. Is that likely to be the case again this year? Can you just kind of help us understand what you expect from the trajectory there? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yes, Rod, let me start, and I'll start with the second question, and then Ken can talk a little bit about the baseline. I know because we've now just re-categorized how we're reporting our numbers, so a little bit of expectation will probably be helpful. Will there be consistent, sequential growth throughout the year in any vertical? Honestly, it's very difficult to predict that because all of our verticals, Cloud included, is going to be lumpy. The fact that we are now in both Routing and Switching in any one vertical, Security to a lesser extent, but Routing and Switching, helps to offset some of that lumpiness. But I expect that the lumpiness will exist and will remain in effect. The good news is I still feel very good about our ability to compete in the Cloud vertical. How close we are to our customers in the Cloud vertical, our ability to understand their requirements, their architecture, and the kinds of innovation that we need to put in place to participate in the Cloud vertical, and on all those counts I feel very good. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. And as it relates to our baseline, you have the numbers right. So we disclosed 19%, moving to 24% of our revenue. That would be a growth rate of 10% to 13%. We did recast the verticals, and the Cloud vertical actually is now up a couple points. So actually the 19% turns to 21% of our business in 2015 with cloud. So the target would move up a couple points as well to 26% of our business. Growth rate targets remain the same. However, we are seeing higher pickup in the cloud than we expected, so we're clearly outpacing those growth rates at this point in the model. Nicholas Rodney Hall - JPMorgan Securities Plc Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. And I hate to follow-up on another cloud question. But as we're now focused on that vertical, and we can see the dynamics separately in your results, I'm curious if you could help us understand the concentration or the diversification rather of your customer base within that vertical and how you would characterize your visibility in that vertical relative to your traditional service provider or Enterprise vertical? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. We can talk about the cloud all day long, because it really is such an important vertical for us, and it's a very deliberate part of our strategy, so no problem at all, Aaron. First, when you think about the cloud opportunity, I want to emphasize again that it really touches every vertical that I'm talking about the cloud opportunity all up. There are certainly those that were born in the cloud, the large cloud providers. There are those that have aspiration to become cloud providers. Think of the telcos and the cable operators that are now re-architecting their networks to deliver cloud services. And then there are those enterprises that see the value in moving workloads and applications to the cloud. All of these are an element of our cloud strategy. The way in which we approach each can vary a little bit. So, for example, our large cloud provider customers have an ability to do a lot of the software developments on their own, but then we developed really innovative technologies like Contrail, our SDN controller, to essentially help automate and secure cloud for the enterprise and for the telco and cable space. That's just to say that all of these verticals really apply. Now if the question is specifically around, sort of, our ability to predict the performance, our performance in the cloud provider vertical itself, I think any one quarter, a quarter here and there you're going to see lumpiness, you're going to see variations in the performance just based on their appetite to spend and where they are in certain projects and certain deployments. But generally speaking, when we talk to them, when we see industry reports, when we understand their own plans, and when we see their own performance, I mean, you see how they are performing in their respective markets, we feel good about the fact that they will continue to rely on networks as a foundation of their business, and we also feel good about our ability to satisfy their networking requirements. It's a very competitive environment, but I feel very confident in our technology. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you very much. The majority of the Q&A has been focused on the products and the new segments, which is fair. Now that we're getting towards the end of the conference call, could you touch briefly on Security? I don't think I heard it mentioned how should we view the Security segment within Juniper and kind of the trajectory, it's been kind of a rough last year in Security division when we look about year-over-year growth. Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Sure, Jim. So, I did mention earlier the fact that Security right now, there's quite a lot of effort that has gone into improving our products, making them competitive, differentiating in the solutions that we offer to our customers. And I think we're seeing very good momentum specifically in the newer technologies and solutions we've introduced into the market. I mentioned the fact that there is a concerted effort right now in terms of go-to-market, marketing, rebuilding our channels, and rebuilding confidence in our customers and our partners' mind where we have quite frankly lost some of that confidence. That's where the effort is. The only additional thing I will say is that there are really strong synergies between Security and the rest of our portfolio. So synergies are on the cost side where we tend to leverage a lot of the software development as well as the silicon technology across Routing and Switching into Security, and increasingly we're seeing actually very solid revenue synergies. If you think about what our SDSN, software-defined secure network, strategy is all about, it's about enabling our customers to use their network infrastructure in an intelligent way to provide a secure fabric, a very secure fabric to prevent essentially their infrastructure, their data, their workloads from being compromised. That is essentially enabling us to sell Security along with Routing and Switching in the data center or in the campus. So I mean that's the other really important element of how we're approaching Security that I think is important for you to understand. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. And my follow-up, the turnaround for the sustainable revenue growth, you mentioned a lot of effort into it. When shall we see the fruit of those efforts start to bear? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. So I think that we're in the process of stabilizing right now. The newer products are growing. The older products are declining. The math is not working for overall growth. This year I think is going to be a critical year for us as we get back to stability and growth probably in the latter half of the year. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you very much for the details. Greatly appreciated. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. You're welcome. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah, thanks. Yeah. Hi, Rami, Ken. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Hello. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Hi, Vijay. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah, hi. I have a bigger-picture question, Rami, which is Juniper and Arista are comparable in market cap now. I mean my view is how would you benchmark productivity per employee versus your peers such as Arista who have significantly lower head count versus Juniper. And then also any thoughts on exiting underperforming areas such as Security to just improve overall fundamentals, better allocate resources to the more productive product portfolio? Thanks. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Well, Vijay, I mean I'll just say that we understand that we operate in a competitive environment. We have competitors that are larger. We have competitors that are smaller than us. The key to our success is to focus, and if you look at what we have done over the last couple of years, there has been an incredible amount of effort put into streamlining our business, pruning our product portfolio to areas where we know that we can invest to compete effectively, and I think we're demonstrating our ability to do just that. The new products that we have now delivered into the market space, especially in the domain of the PTX routing, in our QFX switching, in the new MX line-cards that we have introduced are all essentially doing as we expected. They're growing nicely across our key verticals, and that's what you can expect more from us in the future. I think there was a second part of the question that I've now forgotten. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah. The second part of the question was, any thoughts on exiting underperforming areas such as Security and then pouring the resource into product portfolios that are selling in the market? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. I appreciate that question. Of course, I have to always, as CEO of this company evaluate the performance of any one of our products, technology areas, and businesses. I would just say that as it pertains to Security, which is I think what your question is about, the focus at this period of time is on turning around this business. The data points that we're getting from our customers, our partners are all very positive at this point, and the synergies are really good. The cost synergies and our ability to leverage technology actually enabled us to achieve: A, differentiation; and very solid efficiency in how we develop the technology that's underlying Security. And then there is the revenue synergies on top of that. So that's how I'm thinking about it right now. Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you. Maybe we could touch on the services business for a minute and talk a little bit. It sounds like renewal and attach rates have been pretty strong for last few quarters here. Understanding it was a catch-up in the quarter. But could you just talk a little bit about sustainability of the success there? Can we expect this to keep kind of outgrowing products? And then also related to that, how we should think about gross margin leverage as that business continues to grow? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yes. Thanks for the question. So the service business continues to be a highlight for us. It's a very healthy business for us. On the revenue side, the key is what you mentioned, the attach rates, the renewal rates, and the focus there over the past several quarters is really starting to pay off as we're seeing the revenue growth consistently do well. As you mentioned, we did benefit this quarter from approximately $15 million of revenue that came off of the balance sheet. So you have to factor that in as you start thinking about the rest of the year. But I do expect Security after you normalize  I'm sorry, services, after you normalize for that $15 million, to be up quarter-on-quarter kind of back to our sequential patterns that we normally see in this business. From a longevity perspective, I would expect services to outpace product but not to the same degree that it has over the last several quarters. It will eventually start to normalize closer together on the growth rate perspective. Gross margin wise, numbers we've been posting lately, the 63% to 64% is really what we're focused on going forward. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc. Next question, please. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Jayson Noland of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay, great. Thank you. Ken, just a housekeeping, book-to-bill if you haven't given it. And then a broader question on Security. Rami, if you could  press release cites some weakness in high-end SRX. If you could talk about that a little bit and then the opportunity in virtual SRX it looks like you put some marketing dollars behind that recently. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jayson. Let me start with that and then I'll pass it on to you, Ken. The high-end SRX it addresses a market opportunity that's primarily geared towards telecom providers, especially in the mobile space. And that part of the business is just going to be lumpy. It's going to have fluctuation depending on build outs for typically Tier 1 service providers. The other thing is we have not yet refreshed that part of our portfolio for some time, but we're working on a roadmap to do so that I think will eventually contribute to that business. The virtual SRX, I mean that's a that's an example of how we think about our strategy on a couple of different time horizons. There is the here and now and how our customers are typically building out their security posture today. And then there is what we expect in the future. Clearly, as the perimeter around the enterprise disappears, as workloads and applications moves to the cloud, the security architectures evolve and virtual security offerings become far more important. And we actually have a really differentiated virtual security solution  the virtual SRX that is in the market, that is gaining good traction, but it's still a small market opportunity for this period of time. It's an example of innovation that, we believe, will help us in the second horizon of our strategy in the sort of two, three, four, five year timeframe. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. On the book-to-bill question as our business continues to evolve, and preferred revenue (45:33) grows over time, we believe the commentary around preferred revenue (45:34) is a more meaningful demand metric. So we decided not to disclose book-to-bill any more on a quarterly basis. We will be disclosing backlog on an annual basis going forward in addition to the deferred revenue details. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay. Thanks guys. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc. And as we said, Jayson, that's in line with our peers in terms of that book-to-bill metric, disclosing that metric. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great, thank you. Couple of things I want to ask. One is, in the release, you talk about, I guess, some problems you had with a particular product and some COGS reversals. Could you elaborate a little bit on what happened there, and whether or not that affected any revenue, whether it caused any delays, and how you're remediating that in terms of timing? And then the thing I was trying to understand and back to the cloud, I'm wondering if your cloud vertical has a similar mix, or how the mix compares relative to your overall in terms of percent of revenue coming from Routing, Switching and Security? How does that mix look for the cloud vertical in particular? Thank you. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Well, let me start with the second one, and Ken, you might need to help me with this one. Switching versus Routing mix in the cloud. Now we know that, like I have mentioned I think a couple of times on this call, the business is going to be lumpy. And it's going to be lumpy both in Switching and in Routing. A lot of the growth in the Q1 timeframe for example in the cloud vertical came in Switching. But in the past, there were quarters were it has actually come in more in the Routing. In terms of mix, I don't know if we provided that detail. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. So historically, what we talked about is the cloud vertical mix was largely in line with the Juniper overall mix. So Routing, Switching, Security as Juniper goes, the cloud vertical is largely moving that. As we're seeing more success in Switching, we are seeing some of that mix shift towards Switching faster in that vertical than some of the other verticals. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. I believe that you are referring to... Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. I'm sorry, on the cost, the cost COGS, cost of goods sold information, sorry, on the GAAP results, I think you're talking about a supplier component remediation cost that we had, and it actually started in Q4. We are working with our customers and a third-party supplier. There are certain products we have a clock signal component defect. This is kind of an industry-wide fairly well known situation. We did take a charge in Q4 and we trued up that charge this quarter. We do believe we're handling it very effectively with our customer base and managing through this situation. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. And has that affected your revenue at all? Have you pushed out any sales because of that? That was what I was trying to get at? Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. No, no. It did not have an impact on revenue. It's really more about a proactive approach we're taking to make sure it doesn't have an impact on customers from a quality perspective. We have not seen any actual quality issues to date, but we want to make sure we avoid those going forward and it has not had any impact on revenue. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thanks for the clarification. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Sure. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. You're welcome. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just kind of wondering on kind of the QFX family, I know it was up 50% this quarter year-over-year. How do we think about the refresh cycle there? And how long should this kind of outsized growth last? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah, thanks for the question, Mitch. It's honestly very difficult to answer the question, just because the volume of customers that we now have that are buying QFXs from us across all verticals is very large. And I don't know if you can really put any patterns to it. The one pattern sort of out there is just the 100-gig option. Where there are large data center deployments that require 100-gig connectivity, that's where Juniper just differentiates even more. This is where the density of our products, our Routing stack, the logical scale of our QFX technology starts to really stand out. And for that reason, if you look at our Switching growth, especially as it pertains to the data center over the last few years, it has been quite good. Now if you narrow your analysis and you look specifically on market share in the over 10-gig connectivity space, there we're taking market share even faster. And that's just again because of the fact that where there are high-performance networking problems to be solved, we tend to just stand out among our peers in the industry. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC Got it. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Please go ahead. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc. Yes. Thanks, good afternoon. I just had a quick clarification here, did you guys comment on the cloud with respect to, is it accretive to the model from a gross margin or operating margin perspective? Just kind of curious if gross margin is lower, but maybe on the operating margin side is better? And then my actual question is, Rami, I want to get a sense here just given the greater transparency around the cloud business and the better momentum, is this why back in early March, you announced the expanded organizational focus related to R&D with Kevin and Andy? Does this really mean you need to have a little more focus in terms of servicing your legacy customers, but also your cloud customers from a technology roadmap perspective longer term? Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah, sure. Let me start on the organizational piece. I don't think I would view this from the standpoint of it being specific to any one vertical. I just reached the conclusion that having a flatter organization will result in an ability to execute with more consistency, to move faster with fewer layers in the organization to address what is a very dynamic market opportunity. As it pertains to the cloud providers themselves, we have sort of understood the recipe for how to succeed there for quite a long period of time, where it really has to be an engagement model that is at the engineer-to-engineer level. We are connected with them on a first name basis down throughout the entire organization. And that's really what's required to achieve the necessary understanding of the direction of their architecture and what has enabled us to be successful. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. And from a cloud vertical margin perspective, I would just state that from a gross margin perspective the primary driver within the cloud vertical will be product mix, not the cloud vertical itself. So as it shifts more towards Switching which is what we're seeing now and what we kind of expect to see for the rest of the year that would have a detriment to the telco vertical as an example which is predominantly Routing. But it's not because of the customer itself, it's really more the product mix going into that vertical. From an operating margin perspective, we really don't take the operating margin down to vertical. Most of our cost, most of our OpEx is really shared across all our verticals, we don't segregate it between vertical. So you would see the same  if you were to allocate it out, you would see a similar profile in the op margin as you would on the gross margin, because everything else would be relatively equally and revenue proportionate. I would say, although it is, as the shifts to Switching, you're seeing some margin pressure there, it's very healthy margins. We're very comfortable with the cloud vertical and the mix within the cloud vertical, and in fact that we are ahead of schedule in some of our transitions into the high performance Switching into that vertical, and that's really a good thing overall. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc. Okay. Next question? Operator Thank you. Our final question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you for taking my question. What (53:56) answer couple of longer term strategic questions. First, how do you think about  back to a question Simona asked earlier on the call about the ability to choose between Switching and Routing. How do you think about the opportunity for things like virtual routing et cetera and how does that impact your business strategy (54:17). And then second thing is, in terms use of capital, where does your acquisition strategy stand today, or how does that fit within your use of capital. And then my last question, just on operating expenses, obviously, you continue to control those very well. How should we think about the development of OpEx going forward? Thank you very much. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. Thanks James. Your voice was kind of choppy, so I hope that I got the questions all correctly. You can tell me if I didn't. First in the virtual routing, and I'll extend that to include virtual routing, virtual security. There is certainly an element of the networking industry all up that can be addressed with virtual technologies as opposed to just hardware. Typically, these are going to be more service oriented. They're going to be at the edge of the network. It's very difficult to solve a large core opportunity or a data center spine opportunity with just software or just virtual products. And that obviously is where Juniper has excelled historically. It's where our differentiation mostly has existed in the past. Having said that, as the world moves towards cloud architectures and our customers have the ability to deliver services using a cloud service delivery model that presents an opportunity for us to start to offer virtual versions of our products, like virtual security being an example of that. It's typically going to be for more scale out type of applications, think of the CPE space where the physical CPE business has generally been a small revenue generator for Juniper. Now as the industry transitions to a virtual equivalent model to the CPE space, we view this in fact as a great opportunity for us to go and to participate in. And from an M&A standpoint, no new news there other than we continue to look at M&A strategically as a way of accelerating the strategies that we have talked to you about in the past and we're executing on today. So we're not looking at this to get into adjacent markets. We want to look at this from the standpoint of really accelerating a strategy that we are operating in today. And then last, but not least, is on the operational expenditures, Ken, I'll let you close on that. Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc. Yeah. So we're very pleased with our Q1 OpEx results which came in below the guidance despite the annual reset of variable compensation and kind of typical seasonal patterns in fringe costs. We're very, very happy with our performance. We are targeting 39% of OpEx as a percentage of revenue for the year, which is in line with our long-term target, but actually ahead of schedule. So we're also very pleased with that OpEx discipline going forward. We're always looking to drive efficiencies, but it's beyond efficiencies. We're also looking to make sure we align our workforce to our long-term strategy and make sure that we're able to deliver growth going forward as well. So we believe we could accomplish all of those objectives of keeping expansion in mind throughout the way. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC You guys got them all. Sorry about the bad connection. Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc. No problem. Thank you. Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc. Okay. Thanks, James. And unfortunately, that is all the time we have today. We'd like to thank each of you for your participation, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Sullivan, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead, sir. Jim Sullivan Good morning and welcome, everyone. Thank you for participating in today's conference call and for your interest in Joy Global. Joining me on the call this morning are Ted Doheny, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sean Major, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. This morning I will begin with some brief comments, which expand upon our press release and provide additional background on our results for the first quarter. Ted will then provide an overview of our markets and an update on our outlook for the year. After Ted's comment, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During the call today, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements should be considered along with the various risk factors detailed in our earnings release and other SEC filings that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We encourage you to read and become familiar with these risk factors. We will also refer to a number of non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important to understanding our business. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics to GAAP, as well as for other investor information, we refer you to our website at joyglobal.com. Now a recap of our second quarter results. Bookings in the quarter totaled $681 million, down $64 million or 9% versus the prior year quarter. Orders for original equipment were up 12%, while service orders were down 14% quarter-over-quarter. Original equipment orders were at the highest level since the first quarter of 2015.  After adjusting for foreign currency exchange movements, original equipment orders were up 10% and service bookings were down 12% with the decline in the value of the South African rand relative to the U.S. dollar providing most of the currency impact in the second quarter. Underground mining machinery bookings for the quarter totaled $362 million, down $76 million or 17% versus the prior year quarter and surface mining equipment totaled $340 million. down $4 million or 1%.  The 17% decrease in underground mining machinery bookings was comprised of 15% decrease in original equipment and an 18% decrease in service. Original equipment bookings for the underground segment were down in all regions, except Eurasia with the maturity of the decline in North America and China.  In Eurasia, we booked a long wall system in India, the first order of this type for us in the region with deliveries under the contract occurring over the next few years. We were also successful in booking a room and pillar equipment package for India, which makes it three consecutive quarters we have received this type of order from the region. Service orders for the underground segment decreased in all regions with the exception of Eurasia and Africa. The increase in Eurasia primarily relates to the prior year acquisition of Monobear with this product performing better than plan. The increase in Africa was from rebuild orders.  U.S. underground coal service orders were down $70 million year-over-year and continued to be pressured by low natural gas prices and the follow-on effect from customer idling and maintenance deferrals on our installed base of equipment. China service orders were also down $17 million as government mandated coal production caps take effect in the region. In the surface segment, the 1% decrease in bookings versus the year ago period was comprised of a 10% decrease in service orders offset by original equipment orders doubling. The increase in original equipment bookings was in North America where we booked a multiple electric mining shovel order for a customer in the Canadian oil sands region, partially offset by conveyor equipment orders into Eurasia in the prior year that were not repeated.  Service orders were down in the surface business in all regions with the exception of Eurasia and Africa. For the second quarter in a row, Eurasia service bookings were up year-over-year due to parts orders from India. Over 90% of the service order decline in this segment was in North America from equipment idling at U.S. copper, gold, and iron ore mines. Latin America service orders were again flat as compared to the prior year as maintenance spend in the region remains cautious, even with copper prices increasing from January lows.  Overall, India is starting to show its potential. On a combined basis, orders from this market in the quarter exceeded $100 million as coal production in the region is expected to be at a record high this year. Backlog increased to $976 million from $897 million at the end of the first quarter of 2016 and up 12% from the beginning of fiscal 2016.  Now turning to sales. Net sales of $602 million in the second quarter were down 26% from the prior year with the underground segment down 19% and the surface segment down 33%. Sales of original equipment decreased 35%, while service sales decreased 22% from the prior year second quarter.  After adjusting for foreign currency exchange movements, sales were down 23%, original equipment down 33%, and service sales down 19% with the weaker South African rand and the Australian dollar providing downward pressure. Original equipment sales for the underground segment decreased 5% with the declines in Africa and China, partially offset by increases in North America, Eurasia, and Australia.  The decrease in Africa was primarily due to the prior year delivery of room and pillar equipment not repeated in the current year, while the China decrease primarily related to a lower level of activity in the domestic market with our current focus on customers who value our technology and product differentiation and have the ability to pay their bills in a timely manner. The increases in North America and Australia were primarily related to room and pillar equipment delivered in the quarter into salt and coal applications along with an armored face conveyor sold in Australia for coal. Surface original equipment sales decreased 64%, compared to the prior year second quarter with an increase in North America offset by decreases in all other regions. North America was up on the continued manufacture and delivery of the electric mining shovels booked in 2014, destined for the oil sands. Latin America accounted for most of the year-over-year OE sales decline in this segment on higher prior year sales of electric mining shovels and wheel loaders.  Second quarter service sales in our underground and surface equipment segments decreased year-over-year, 24% and 20% respectively. The underground segment experienced service sales declines in all regions with the exception of Australia, which had increased rebuild sales, and Eurasia from the addition of the Montabert products to the portfolio. The surface segment had decreased service sales in all regions with the exception of Eurasia, primarily due to part sales into India. Most of the decline in service sales year-over-year was in North America. Operating income from continuing operations in quarter, excluding restructuring charges totaled $30 million, as compared to adjusted operating income of $101 million in the year ago period and a loss of $18 million in the first quarter. The $71 million decrease in adjusted operating profit versus the year ago quarter was primarily due to lower sales volumes, unfavorable mix, and under-absorption in our manufacturing and service centers, partially offset by savings from our cost reduction programs and decreased incentive compensation expense. The $49 million sequential improvement in adjusted operating profit was driven by seasonally higher service sales and increased cost reduction. This resulted in a strong incremental margin of over 60% and demonstrates the significant operating leverage the company has to increase service volumes. During the quarter we incurred restructuring charges of $35 million, mostly in the underground North America and China regions resulting from further actions taken to reduce staffing levels and optimize the companys global manufacturing and service footprint.  Roughly, a third of the restructuring charges were cash in nature and they included employee severance and facility termination cost, while the remaining two-thirds represented non-cash impairment and accelerated depreciation charges. The year-over-year savings in the quarter from cost actions taken to date was $20 million. We expect to incur an additional $30 million to $40 million of restructuring charges over the remainder of the year bringing full year charges to a range of $95 million to $105 million. This compares to our previous full year guidance for restructuring charges of $45 million to $55 million. Of the incremental $50 million of restructuring charges approximately 75% are non-cash in nature and are related to the footprint moves in North America and China. We are now targeting year-over-year cost reduction in excess of $100 million with approximately two-thirds of the savings expected in the second half of this year.  So, we now expect total restructuring charges for the year of roughly $100 million, 50% of the charges are cash, and 50% are non-cash. The restructuring actions projected this year are expected to provide carryover cost savings in fiscal 2017 in the range of $40 million to $50 million. Our detrimental margin on the year-over-year sales decline in the quarter was 34%. This brings the year-to-date detrimental margin to 38%, with our targeted cost reduction in the back half of the year, we are on track to meet or beat our targeted 34% detrimental margin for the year. The income tax rate for the quarter, excluding call outs and discrete benefits was 51%. The adjusted income tax rate in the quarter was high and it's due to losses in certain subsidiaries that do not have a current tax benefit. This dynamic is expected to drive continued quarter-to-quarter volatility in our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we still expect the effective tax rate, excluding call out items to be in the mid-30s.  Adjusted income from continuing operations totaled $9 million or $0.09 for fully diluted share in the second quarter, as compared to adjusted income from continuing operations of $62 million or $0.64 per fully diluted share in the prior year quarter. During the second quarter, we recognized net income from discontinued operations of $5 million. This was due to loss contingencies from our former drilling business that are no longer considered to be probable, partially offset by associated inventory that is no longer expected to be utilized. Cash provided by continuing operations in the second quarter totaled $44 million, as compared to $71 million in the second quarter of 2015. The year-over-year decrease in cash from operations in the quarter was primarily due to lower earnings, partially offset by increased cash from the monetization of trade working capital in the current period. The monetization of trade working capital in the second quarter of 2016 resulted in cash generation of $32 million, compared to cash usage for trade working capital of $15 million in the prior year second quarter.  From an inventory perspective, we were able to drive a $28 million constant currency decrease in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to a $26 million increase in the prior year second quarter. This brings the total constant currency inventory decrease since the end of fiscal 2015 to $55 million on track to deliver over $100 million of reduction for the year.  While we are committed to carry service inventory to support our customers as they destock their mine sites and continue to operate in a great fix maintenance mode, we remain focused on realizing further structural improvements with inventory in fiscal 2017. We are also being very diligent in the collection of our accounts receivable. While sales in the second quarter increased approximately 14% sequentially, accounts receivable only increased $2 million on a constant currency basis.  The companys DSO at the end of the second quarter of 2016 improved three days versus prior year second quarter and 11 days sequentially despite continued challenging market conditions. We've also had good success in the quarter driving extended payment terms and improved cash flow with our key is suppliers. Capital expenditures in the second quarter 2016 totaled $13 million, down $5 million versus the prior year and were mainly consisting of spending on the build-out of our service capability in Eurasia and general facility maintenance. We continue to defer non-critical project spending and now expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million, which is down $10 million from our guidance in March.  Also in the second quarter, we were able to monetize certain non-core assets with proceeds totaling $1 million. Through the first six months of 2016, we have monetized $11 million of non-core assets with the full year now expected to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million. On the March 2016 earnings call, we indicated 2016 cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from the sale of non-core assets would be approximately $200 million, with strong cash generation of $142 million in the first half of 2016 we now expect full year cash generation will be in the range of $200 million to $225 million. In December 2015, we proactively sought an amendment on our credit facility to provide increased financial flexibility for an extended downturn. The second quarter of 2016 consolidated leverage covenant increased from 3 times to 3.5 times on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis. We ended the second quarter with leverage up 2.7 times well within the covenant limit. While our leverage ratio is expected to increase in the back half of 2016 on lower year-over-year adjusted EBITDA levels, the covenant also increases from the current 3.5 level to 4.5 level in the fourth quarter and will remain at that level through the second quarter of fiscal 2017. We remain confident in our ability to manage the business within the amended covenant limits. During the second quarter we prepaid our required term loan amortization payments for the remainder of the fiscal year. Going forward, we may continue to use our excess cash to reduce our term loan balance and provide increased cushion on our leverage covenant. Let me stop there and turn the discussion over to Ted. Ted Doheny Thanks, Jim, and let me add my welcome to everyone on the call today. Despite ongoing challenges in commodity markets, our bookings and financial results in the second quarter were better than expected. We secured a couple of nice growth related equipment bookings in the quarter and saw sequential improvement in earnings in part due to continued execution on our cost reduction initiatives. Additionally, our keen focus on managing trade working capital resulted in another solid quarter of cash generation. Although, there were a few positive signs that emerged during the quarter that suggested some commodity markets were moving closer to rebalancing, the overall mining market remains under significant pressure with continued reductions in capital expenditures and deferral of maintenance activities in particular with U.S. coal. Despite this tough landscape, our teams around the world continue to do an exceptional job supporting our customers in delivering the best equipment and service solutions. Our focus continues to be on driving our strategies, creating growth in a down market and controlling the things we can. During the quarter, we received an order for two more P&H 4100 electric mining shovels to go into the demanding Canadian oil sands application. While oil prices have rebounded nearly 36% from February lows, they are still down 20% from a year ago. Most oil sands customers we work with have production cost between $30 and $40 per barrel and are still producing positive margins. Our customers base these projections on longer term pricing trends, which are expected to return to an upward trajectory as global energy demand increases. The Canadian oil sands are among the most challenging applications in mining, incredibly high production rates are required and sometimes extreme climate conditions and our P&H 4100 electric mining shovel has proven to be the machine of choice in this region. Our equipments superior reliability, uptime availability and faster loading capabilities were all differentiators in winning this order. While we realize a significant win in the quarter in the Canadian oil sands from original equipment perspective, we expect some near-term headwinds on the service side as a result of the forest fires in that region. We expect a combination of evacuations, idle production, and reduced availability at our service facilities could negatively impact revenues $10 million to $15 million for the fiscal year. During quarter we also had some nice wins in the Indian coal market. We've been active in this market for years and been working several prospects as domestic production continues to increase and move towards full mechanization. Through differentiation and demonstration of our full system solution, we were able to secure an order for a long wall system during the quarter. Additionally, we secured our third room and pillar system package in as many quarters and booked significant parts orders to service our domestic shovel fleet. All great examples of how we continue to differentiate our products in a cash strained market. The continued expectation for production increases and drive towards higher productivity equipment provides us with the opportunity over the next few years to expand our presence in India. While the India coal market continues to grow, the pressure on U.S. coal market has not subsided. Year-to-date, we seen production decline $118 million tons or 33% year-over-year as producers battle elevated inventory levels, a reduced coal demand, largely stemming from an abundant supply of low cost natural gas. For the year, we now expect U.S. coal production will be about 700 million tons, approximately 190 million tons lower than 2015 and 90 million tons lower than the rate expected just earlier this year. Despite the step down, coal production is still expected to improve modestly in the second half of the year compared to the first half. We've certainly seen the impact of the significant pressure in the U.S. coal market on our service business. On the underground side, the shifting away from room and pillar operations in central Appalachia, along with reduced met coal output has seen our parts and rebuild bookings declined 29% and 43% respectively when comparing the last 12 months to the prior comparable period. Similarly, our service business in North America on the surface side has been dealing with the dual challenges of the declining PRB production and reduced copper output in the southwestern United States. The combined impact of these headwinds resulted in a 27% decline in bookings when comparing the current 12-month period to the prior comparable period, as copper production declined steadily through the second half of 2015 and PRB production is currently trending nearly 20% below where it was just a year ago on an LTM basis. While our U.S. coal business has been under severe pressure, the declines in our sales and order rates are in line with reductions we've seen in our active fleet of equipment. As the U.S. coal market begins to normalize at a lower level in 2017, we expect the pressures on our service business will lessen as the industry consolidates and adjusts to a new market condition. Over the medium term, as the market begins to rebalance, inventories normalize and the reorganization of the industry plays out, we expect the delayed maintenance and the remaining U.S. coal fleet will create upside to our service business. One area where we've seen recent signs of stabilization is in Latin America, particularly with our copper business. In recent months, we've seen an uptick in mine production particularly in Peru where production is trending nearly 36% above where it was a year ago. This, along with our service facility expansion in the region, has helped stabilize our service business. We've also seen a stabilization in our Australian service business as iron ore and coal production have remained steady. This is translated to our current run rate on rebuilds trending at nearly 13% above trough levels experienced as of Q1 2015. We can't control market dynamics; however, as we continue to drive our strategies, our teams are realizing wins in new markets with new, highly differentiated products and services. An example during the quarter for us was our continued penetration into the industrial minerals market as we book several of our new, heavy continuous miners into potash and phosphate mines in the U.S. and Asia. These new continuous miner systems are transforming traditional drill and blast operators to mechanize mining systems that offer a step function improvement in safety, production, and cost per ton for the mines. These orders demonstrate the effectiveness of our direct service relationships with customers. In both cases, we were able to demonstrate the efficiencies of these machines by taking potential buyers to reference mines to let our customers show, firsthand, the performance difference. This is why we're passionate as a company that every customer is a reference. It drives our service business and helps us create new opportunities to expand our customer base. We continue to meet key milestones with our new products. The hybrid excavator has been in full mining production mode for nearly a quarter and is meeting or exceeding all key performance metrics. It's generating great excitement in the industry as the fuel savings combined with the efficiency of an electric mining shovel are causing many of our customers to view this as an alternative with the competitive advantage to their existing hydraulic excavator fleet. While industry acceptance and critical mass remain key, we believe this product is on schedule and represents a $300 million to $400 million opportunity over the next several years. We also had success in the quarter with a customer trial on our new underground hard rock loader. The new Joy LHD is progressing well in an Australian coal mine operation and we expect this machine will also be a revenue contributor in 2017. During quarter, we continued to drive our Joy branded service products and consumables. Despite the ongoing cannibalization of our fleet in several regions, we're realizing consumable wins such as wire rope for shovel and various cutting tool offerings for both surface and underground equipment. These orders reflect market share gains that are being driven by product differentiation and incorporating them into our service programs. While we realize some good successes during the quarter with strategic orders, the industry challenges remain. Global growth projections have come down a bit and most commodity markets continue to rebalance. With recent supply curtailments, those are starting to help. During the quarter, we continue to take the necessary actions to reduce cost and position the company for success while now protecting our critical capabilities for future growth markets. We'll continue to take cost out of the business and optimize our global manufacturing and service footprint. We will continue to improve our balance sheet with excess cash generation. We have more opportunities to monetize non-core assets and further structurally reduce trade working capital. While the mining industry continues to face headwinds, we believe we have the right strategies to help our customers weather these challenges. Developing and demonstrating our product superiority and ability to meaningful lower customers operating costs will enable us to win. Supporting our customers during these unprecedented times insures we will be with them as the market recovers. In light of the additional step down in forecasted full year U.S. coal production, combined with business interruption in the Canadian oil sands from the fires, we now expect our sales and adjusted earnings for the year to be at the lower end of our previous guidance range. As it relates to phasing in the back half of the year, we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings to be in line with our second quarter results. These are certainly challenging times, but we continue to prudently manage the business and remain focused on delivering on our commitments to our customers and our shareholders. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Alicia for questions and answers. Alicia? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Ross Gilardi of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ross Gilardi Good morning, guys. Ted Doheny Hi, Ross. Ross Gilardi I had a couple of questions. First of all, the service order number of $515 million means should we look at that as the seasonal peak for the year, or do you expect to sort of muddle through it kind of at the $500 million quarterly run rate for borders on the service side? Ted Doheny Typically, that's a little bit higher than what we would look at, as you've heard from our commentary, we aren't seeing too many bright spots out there, so I think roughly in that $500 million number might be on the high side if we look at the second half of the year. Ross Gilardi Got it. Ted Doheny So a little bit below the Ross Gilardi And is there any way to say what your  so the overall year-on-year service bookings were down 14%, could you say what it looked like ex-U.S. coal? Ted Doheny Probably have to go around the world, Ross, with that for you. I don't know if I have that specifically off the top of my head, but U.S. coal is we highlighted pretty clearly was the major impact. We have some puts and takes around the world, I could probably go around the world with you if that would help, but I don't know what specific number is. Ross Gilardi I was just curious if you think  are you up ex the U.S.? But otherwise we can take it offline afterwards. Ted Doheny Yeah, it's regionally. Jim Sullivan Ross, we did mention in my comments the impact on U.S. coal bookings. It was mostly on the underground side of the business and year-over-year was down 70 million, so you can kind of go from there. Its a big number. Ross Gilardi Yeah, got it. And then last thing I just wanted to ask on India, is this like a secular mechanization trend thats just finally starting to accelerate or are the orders you're getting more of replacement type business and kind of how big is your India business today? Can you remind us of that? Ted Doheny Pretty small. We don't have the exact percentage. But to help you frame it up, yes, it is a structural change for us as the Indian market has just been very, very inefficient, its mostly surface mining. We have quite a few shovels there, but they are 20-30 years old, so that you saw some of the parts business there, but what's changing is they're privatizing the coal blocks. Theyve been working on this for quite some time and the order that we mentioned, which is a pretty significant long wall for us has been in the works for well over five years. So as they privatize these coal blocks, they are looking for the right player. We've been in India for quite some time, so they definitely liked our equipment, they liked our service presence, but it's at  in this order, its not the same size of an Australian or U.S. long wall because we leveraged our China supply in here as well. Give you an example, this long wall instead of having the big continuous miners driving the entry development were actually going to be using our road headers from China. So its not a $100 million long wall, it's below $100 million. It's the same margin, but we expect more of these coal blocks coming over the next few years. We're quite cautious about India. We're very planned, we want to make sure we have the right terms and conditions, the right service mechanism in place, so we think it's upside, but it is a structural change. There's more of this to come. We've been in there with our room and pillar packages as I also highlighted this is now the third one in a quarter, so we're seeing it with the room and pillar underground operation. And on the surface side, what we're excited about is we're recharging the fleet. We're bringing some of our new designs to that existing fleet in selling some pretty nice parts orders to a pretty large fleet of shovels. We're working hard also to potentially turn some of those older equipment  those older shovels into some of our new design. So we think over time India will grow. Will it replace the U.S. in size? No, but India is a significant growth market, and it's all driven by the macroeconomics that the India market needs electricity, and they have a huge poverty issue on electricity there. So we see  its a pretty significant upside in the next five years for us. Ross Gilardi Thank a lot, Ted. Operator We'll go next to Mig Dobre of Robert Baird. Mig Dobre Yes, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I guess maybe going back to U.S. coal and I'm hoping Jim you can help me out here a little bit. So you gave us what I would consider to be some pretty big numbers here, $87 million declines in service revenues, you mentioned service orders being down $70 million year-over-year. If I remember from your prior disclosures, U.S. coal accounted for something like 22% of your fiscal 2015 revenues. So just running that math, it seems to me like U.S. coal is down 50% or thereabouts year-over-year. I'm just trying to understand if I'm thinking about this correctly and what sort of percentage of revenue or bookings at this point does U.S. coal account for?  Jim Sullivan Mig, this is Jim. You're correct with your numbers at the end of last quarter, LTM basis U.S. coal represented about 20% with thermal being about 16%, again LTM basis. As we pull in the second quarter, LTM basis were down to about 18%. Not much change with met coal, that's still around 4% but the thermal coal side has come down to about 14%, so you're correct. The numbers are pretty significant year-over-year down in that segment of the business. Mig Dobre Okay, I appreciate that. And then going back to your guidance here, given that we've got moves of this magnitude, sequentially in the back half of the year, how do you think about U.S. coal? Is it additional deterioration? 2017, you are pretty clear how you're thinking about it. What about the back half? Jim Sullivan Well, clearly the back half is down from what we previously thought because of the production declines that Ted talked about in the market. But again if you look at the first half run rate of production versus the second half, I think everyone expects even if the full year is at that 700 million number that the back half would be up a bit from the first half production was. So down from previous expectation, but we don't see a lot of downside from where we delivered the first half of the year. Now as you know from our discussions, this market is volatile and our customers are reorganizing and that process creates some chunkiness with our business as they secure the support of their constituents and a reorganization process that does have a tendency to slow things down a bit initially, but then once they get the alignment then things pick back up. And we do have customers that are at various stages of that process and so just a bit of caution in terms of the chunkiness of that business but overall if you were to look at the pattern first half versus second half, we wouldn't expect a big change in that segment. Mig Dobre Appreciate it, thanks. Jim Sullivan You bet. Operator We'll go next to Michael Gallo of CL King. Michael Gallo Hi, good morning. I just want to dig in a little bit more on India and the opportunity there, Ted. It would seem that consumptions really been out tripping production by a widening margin over the last five years and it seems like you're more optimistic on this market than I can remember in recent memory. I was wondering if you can frame out whether you see additional increased quotation activity or you think you'll book more systems. I know there is some lumpiness over the next six months to 12 months and whether you can frame out looking out a few years, how big the potential opportunity for Joy might be in India? Thanks. Ted Doheny Okay, well the keyword that you use there was lumpy. We've been working on this particular contract as I mentioned for a number of years and there's more out there as these coal blocks open up. We're pretty selective on the ones we want to go to. We make sure we have the service in place but there's quite a few out there but we hedge India pretty strong. So the activity, if we look at our activity around the world, India is probably the strongest with what we see both on the room and pillar packages, what we see on these long walls. Framing it up though, if we look at this something less than a $100 million on this long wall and room and pillar packages round about $10 million, so we see India over the next five years being definitely in that $0.5 billion opportunity for us and that's what we're driving to. Internally, it's a bigger number but we hedge it back because it takes time. Everything in India takes longer so the quote numbers if we look at our quote logs are actually bigger than that but we think we have a pretty good line of sight to get I'll say multiple long walls and multiple room and pillar packages as well as the surface fleet.  We're going after those shovels as well. We think with what we call our best cost country sourcing strategy leveraging our China supply, but also leveraging some of the local supply opportunities we have in India. So framing it up for you, definitely its $0.5 billion opportunity and we're all over it and it fits into what we do well and I think now that we have that China sourcing opportunity, we can go in there with good margins at the right performance cost solution for the customer, so it's a good opportunity in a really, really tough market, so yes. Michael Gallo Thanks very much, Ted. Operator We'll go next to Steven Fisher of UBS. Steven Fisher Thanks. Good morning. Wonder if you could just give us a little more detail on the oil sands shovel order, how big is it in terms of revenue opportunity, when do you expect delivery of it, would it be another two years like the one you had from 2014 and then is this replacement or expansion? Ted Doheny I'll frame it up. We don't want to give the specifics on it but it's a multiple order less than three, so it's a couple machines going to the oil sands and it's for expansion but it's already planned expansion that's there. These are very, very large facilities basically it's like refinery, so the production plans in place, it's a couple units. We don't frame up the dollar amount but if you took this in the long wall, we're looking at the two of them together north of hundred plus, 120. So roughly frame it up $50 million for the couple of shovels. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, this is tremendous service business because boy they work these things hard. They're in the oil sands so in the summer very loose soil these shovels have to operate on, so very, very wide tracks, very abrasive environment. So it goes through our ground engagement tools literally replace all of the teeth every 48 hours, so very, very demanding application. So as to your question on the timing, this is a planned I think 18 in the next 18 to 24 months so it's scheduled with the other machines as you highlighted we have in the production plan. And by the way as I mentioned the fires, those are still on plan. We had a little bit of a hiccup with the disruption of our team there, but we still believe those that were already on order are still on schedule and no issue with those going forward, so I hope that helps a little color. Steven Fisher Yeah, that's perfect, thank you. And I know you guys are being more strict on past terms with customers. Can you just talk a little bit about how much of your cash flow in the first half of the year was advanced payments and of the 200 to 225 that you expect for the full year, how much do you think of that would be considered advance payments? Ted Doheny We give a lot of detail but we're probably not going to go to that level of detail in terms of the projection Steve but you can look on the cash flow statement on our press release. And if you look at the year-to-date for advanced payments and progress payments that is called out on a line and year-to-date it's minus 6 million. So year-to-date we've generated 160 million of cash from our trade working capital. This is constant currency basis roughly 200 million from the combination of receivables in inventory and we had cash use of about 6 million per advance payments and trade accounts payable, so netting together to 160 million. Just at a high level we would continue to see inventory as a source of cash in the back half of the year, trade accounts receivable not much of a change. We did pull in a lot in the first quarter and that was due to the sequential step down we saw from Q4 2015 to Q1 2016. We were flat in the second quarter and we expect the second half of the year to be approximately flat and then there will be more outflow on advance payments and progress billings, but I'd rather steer clear of an exact number there. Steven Fisher Okay that's helpful, thanks a lot. Ted Doheny You bet. Operator We'll go next to Joe O'Dea of Vertical Research Partners. Joe O'Dea Hi, good morning. First on the higher cost saves that you're targeting for the year, you're saying over 100 million, it sounds like from the carryover that you're targeting for 2017 that that would be more like 130, 135 million of cost saves you're looking at for this year, just want a general sense of whether that's the right way to be thinking about it? Ted Doheny The cost saves this year are going to be less than that. We had said 100 million coming out of the first quarter and we are now saying in excess of 100 million, I wouldn't go 30% higher than where we were. I would go in that 5-10% range. But the actions that we've taken in the second quarter and will continue to take in the back half of the year to position ourselves well for next year are clearly going to have some carryover benefits and we tried to help you out in terms of what we thought that would be in the 40-50 million range. Joe O'Dea Right and thats helpful. And I guess just as you went through the quarter, why these were decided, why you chose to maybe pull these actions forward a little bit or if there were new efforts underway to identify more cost opportunities just to understand you started the year at 85 million and step it up to a 100 and now stepping up even higher, what you did to kind of identify those whether it was previously planned actions or whether this is new stuff that you've gone after? Ted Doheny Well, we're doing everything we can to optimize under the current environment. We're realistic about the business where we're at in the cycle and where its going to go over the next few years. So it's just continued push from us in this tough market. We did see as we talked about the pull-down in terms of U.S. coal production and some of the impacts from the oil sands fires which is really a bit more transitory, but yeah, we are always looking for opportunities to take cost out of the business and we want to do what we can to continue to protect the bottom line. Jim Sullivan Joe, one other piece on that, we're going through the quarters we're trying to be extremely transparent with everyone but also when we're taking action, some of these are significant facilities. So in the last quarter when we shared we were going to take it up to a 100 million that triggered because what we saw specifically as Jim highlighted, what was happening to U.S. coal we had to trigger and pull forward our footprint optimization plan and some of those facilities were significant being in China where we didn't explicitly mention that, those are now been announced underway. And the recent pushing is now over a 100 million, we have better line of sight. We've been through the details, we made the announcement so we see line of sight that we're tracking over that 100 million. And as Jim highlighted it's not to the 130 it's within that 5% to 10% over the hundred, but we have announced them, we have visibility, we know where the plans are, we get the teams in place, tough, tough action but we now have better line of sight to that and these are pretty significant parts of our structure globally. Joe O'Dea Thank you. And then just one more you previously talked about rebuilds that were scheduled for the back half of this year. I think seeing better back activity this year than what you would have had a year ago, just kind of checking to see whether that remains on pace, any changes to some of the anticipated rebuilds that were scheduled for later this year. Jim Sullivan No, it's still the same, what's only different this year is we're tracking every single one. We have the capacity that we're taking capacity offline to get our utilization, so we have some unplanned or not booked I'm sorry rebuilds on the second half of the year we have to go get, but we have pretty good line of sight of that around the world. On the U.S. coal piece, as we highlighted, that 700 million tons that we talked about, the significant reduction in the first half, we sense there could be a pick up on some of that in the second half just because the first half has been down so much but that would be a slight so we see that in the U.S. which is still though we highlighted 18% of our business, it's still a big piece that's important.  The other rebuilds around the world, we did see the stabilization in Australia so we do think we have some pick up on the rebuilds there. South Africa continues to perform well. We have a large fleet there and that one is tied not only to thermal coal and the utility industry that's short but its also tied into the coal to oil which is a big piece of our South African business, so we have a pretty good line of sight on that on the rebuild. And as we highlighted the copper markets, we continue to do well and really, really tough market as well in copper in Latin America. So just going around the world, we see that second half visibility and we're just trying to be careful, it's still a tough market. But we see the line of sight and we still have some work to do to go get though. We don't have it all-in house right now. Joe O'Dea Okay, thanks very much. Operator We'll go next to Lucas Pipes of FBR & Company. Lucas Pipes Hi, good morning, everybody and congrats on a great very good quarter and also the solid bookings. I wanted to follow-up on the bookings side and obviously a good job with oil sands order in India and I wonder what sort of visibility you have as it relates to the sustainability of the bookings, anything kind of that would give you comfort that that's the right ballpark to look at for the second half of the year or maybe even a little bit more than what you just did in Q2? Thank you. Ted Doheny Yes. I have to use the word lumpy there again you know, we try to highlight the lumpiness in the quarter with the oil sands order and the longwall. Looking at the second half, we have prospects that are out there, but in this tough market, we're cautious of what's going, the bookings in the second half of the year. So as far as having a 680 is the new run rate of bookings, that's probably on the high side, getting back in that 500, 550 for the bookings is probably what we're looking at. Not to say that some of these orders could come in. We want to make sure that we highlighted, it's lumpiness that's still going to be out there in front of us. Lucas Pipes Got it, that's helpful, thank you. And then, maybe to go back to the coal side, I'm reading a lot about the restructuring program in China with the reduction of working days consolidation. When you look at what's going on over there do you see overall as an opportunity to maybe take some market share with your technology or should we be thinking about some headwinds just because production is curtailed. How do you think about the developments there? Ted Doheny Im sorry, can you say which area were you looking at first? Lucas Pipes That was in China. Ted Doheny Oh, China, okay, China is tough. As we shared with you the strategy for China is still the same, we're focusing on highly, highly differentiated products for customers who have money and where we get paid. Where we see the market going on our imported product is still for large shares where we have an opportunity to differentiate for some of those huge coal blocks, but it's really the little stuff right now that we're going after. We did in the quarter to get a nice success in China for an armored face conveyor. So that will come in to an existing longwall where we sold the new system, but the imported market is tough. The local market is even tougher. What we're battling to show in China is our localized new products that make a difference. We had a localized continuous miner bolter that we think will change the game. We have customers looking at it. We are bringing references around it, but the market is extremely cash strained right now. So it's going to be a battle in China for awhile. So the success we've had in China in the quarter is just to highlight, the third part of our China strategy is to get our cost base there that wed be and take some of that we call that segment II and segment III product to some of these other growth opportunities around the world and we shipped part of the longwall thats - we will ship part of the longwall going to India from China, as well as the road header. So, China market is just really tough. We are chasing customers where it can pay and have the ability to pay. We're chasing orders where we can differentiate our products and help them lower their cost per ton. So, just tough, tough, tough for us in China right now. Lucas Pipes That's very helpful thank you. Operator We'll go next to Larry Demaria of William Blair. Larry Demaria Hi, good morning, everybody thanks. Ted Doheny Hi, Larry. Larry Demaria Hi. Curious, it sounds like obviously you're winning some of the new business because of price, which is really a function of the lower China cost footprint. So curious on few things, first of all I guess overall price competition what's it like out there and how sustainable is this low cost advantage from what you see in the market. I'm not sure how far ahead of you guys - you guys are ahead of other folks? And then secondly, or thirdly, as far as the portfolio goes, how much are you know being able to source from China say from a couple years ago? Ted Doheny Well Larry let me just correct you, winning it on price or maybe what you said on cost. We are battling extremely hard on product differentiation. So even the oil sands order, just to highlight that one, incredibly competitive. You can imagine in todays market having a shovel opportunity. We went head-to-head against our number one competitor then it went past that we went head-to-head against used equipment; then we had to go head-to-head against China supply. So pricing in todays market is extremely challenging. The reason I'm being clear, I'm not saying we went into discount to get the order. We fought on the differentiator and we actually did time studies and productivity studies in the oil sands that we were able to show a $7 million operating savings which is huge. So, we're battling to show the performance of the product is what we're battling for today to get good margins for this equipment. So, I just want to be really careful that when you say price were not going to cost. Where I mentioned the longwall, where I told you we're bringing in the right cost product using our best cost country sourcing strategy in this case which was China, we looked at what the performance of that longwall was. How many tons per year, tons per month that they're going after and then looking at that with the right cost performance, we were able to leverage our best cost country sourcing supply to meet the order. On that one, we competed with Polish suppliers. So a good margin I just want to be really careful. We're fighting really, really hard for product differentiation and it's a tough market out there. So, I just want to make sure that I was clear on that. To the second part of your question, we're moving the needle on what we're getting out of our China supply. Don't have the percentage on that for you, but that's also part of our cost savings as we're working to see can we get our internal material cost productivity targets. Were leveraging our China team quite a bit and we've been there now for awhile, so we have a pretty good sourcing team there and so we're bringing some pretty good quality components to our facilities around the world. Okay? Larry Demaria Okay that's good, thank you. Ted Doheny Alicia, we can probably have time for one more call. Operator All right we'll go next to Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets. Seth Weber Hi guys, good morning. Ted Doheny Good morning, Seth. Seth Weber Hi. So in some of your prepared comments, and also how you've answered some questions, you both Jim and Ted have referenced trying to find customers in China that will pay or that have money. Can you talk about whats your receivables exposures is looking like in China and if there's been any change to kind of your bad debt experience there? Ted Doheny We're being very selective on the customers that we're going after in that market now. I'll remind you, Seth that we did take a bad debt charge in the fourth quarter of close to $20 million and as we transitioned into FY 2016, we redoubled our focus on making sure that we're dealing with the right customer set. So, I think we're managing it well. If you look at our AR exiting the second quarter, the China domestic receivables would have still been in that low 20% area and our sales are just under 10%. So clearly, that's the market where we have a longer dated receivables. In contrast is the U.S. coal market, which we talked about and we continue to manage down that exposure. Today, again exiting the second quarter, U.S. coal receivables represented about 10% of our total receivables and our sales, we talked about early on an LTM basis are closer to 18%. So those two regions are the push and the pull in terms of the aging of our receivables. Seth Weber Right, okay that's helpful, thank you. And then just lastly I'm trying to just tie together some of your comments about the service bookings in the quarter where they've been trending on an organic basis for the last three or four quarters and your U.S. coal commentary. I mean, do you think at this point it's realistic to think that the service business could be up in 2016? Ted Doheny Up from last year. Seth Weber From a revenue basis, yeah, would you given the bookings trends and your U.S. coal commentary, it sounds like maybe things are stabilizing there in the back half of the year. I'm just - how are you thinking about, sorry go ahead. Ted Doheny No, and I just want to make is sure I understand the question, Seth. As far as 2017 over 2016, I think the market if we look at what we see and look at the same thing, if we look at the CapEx forecast for next year and things are moving to the right and theyre taking the 2017 aggregated CapEx down from our customer base, but what we're looking at is so let's say the core business, the fleet will be challenged. So, we are not giving 2017 guidance, but we think we have an opportunity to drive the initiatives that we should see growth in 2017 if we don't see another step down appreciably over 2016 or 2017. So, if we had the initiatives we get better traction on the consumables we got pretty cool service products out there. We do have stabilization in some of our non-coal markets. We have seen, I didn't talk about this time but maybe next call we'll talk about what's going on with Montabert with the hard rock breakers we see some growth there, but it's going to be initiative driven and it's going to be really tough with the market. We've also seen the share capture, not just with our equipment, but some of the longwalls penetrating, some of our other components. So tough market, long answer for 2017. If we get growth it's because we think we're driving the initiatives. I don't want to forecast the bottom to you is what I'm saying. Seth Weber No, I understand, but just to make sure you're talking about the service business at this point, right? Ted Doheny Correct, yes. Seth Weber Not the total revenue line? Ted Doheny Correct. Seth Weber Okay thank you very much guys, I appreciate it. Ted Doheny Thanks, Seth. Okay, so that's it. I just want to thank everybody for the call and we look forward to talking to all of you next quarter, thank you very much. Alicia, back to you. Operator Thank you, sir.

[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Ross Gilardi of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ross Gilardi Good morning, guys. Ted Doheny Hi, Ross. Ross Gilardi I had a couple of questions. First of all, the service order number of $515 million means should we look at that as the seasonal peak for the year, or do you expect to sort of muddle through it kind of at the $500 million quarterly run rate for borders on the service side? Ted Doheny Typically, that's a little bit higher than what we would look at, as you've heard from our commentary, we aren't seeing too many bright spots out there, so I think roughly in that $500 million number might be on the high side if we look at the second half of the year. Ross Gilardi Got it. Ted Doheny So a little bit below the Ross Gilardi And is there any way to say what your  so the overall year-on-year service bookings were down 14%, could you say what it looked like ex-U.S. coal? Ted Doheny Probably have to go around the world, Ross, with that for you. I don't know if I have that specifically off the top of my head, but U.S. coal is we highlighted pretty clearly was the major impact. We have some puts and takes around the world, I could probably go around the world with you if that would help, but I don't know what specific number is. Ross Gilardi I was just curious if you think  are you up ex the U.S.? But otherwise we can take it offline afterwards. Ted Doheny Yeah, it's regionally. Jim Sullivan Ross, we did mention in my comments the impact on U.S. coal bookings. It was mostly on the underground side of the business and year-over-year was down 70 million, so you can kind of go from there. Its a big number. Ross Gilardi Yeah, got it. And then last thing I just wanted to ask on India, is this like a secular mechanization trend thats just finally starting to accelerate or are the orders you're getting more of replacement type business and kind of how big is your India business today? Can you remind us of that? Ted Doheny Pretty small. We don't have the exact percentage. But to help you frame it up, yes, it is a structural change for us as the Indian market has just been very, very inefficient, its mostly surface mining. We have quite a few shovels there, but they are 20-30 years old, so that you saw some of the parts business there, but what's changing is they're privatizing the coal blocks. Theyve been working on this for quite some time and the order that we mentioned, which is a pretty significant long wall for us has been in the works for well over five years. So as they privatize these coal blocks, they are looking for the right player. We've been in India for quite some time, so they definitely liked our equipment, they liked our service presence, but it's at  in this order, its not the same size of an Australian or U.S. long wall because we leveraged our China supply in here as well. Give you an example, this long wall instead of having the big continuous miners driving the entry development were actually going to be using our road headers from China. So its not a $100 million long wall, it's below $100 million. It's the same margin, but we expect more of these coal blocks coming over the next few years. We're quite cautious about India. We're very planned, we want to make sure we have the right terms and conditions, the right service mechanism in place, so we think it's upside, but it is a structural change. There's more of this to come. We've been in there with our room and pillar packages as I also highlighted this is now the third one in a quarter, so we're seeing it with the room and pillar underground operation. And on the surface side, what we're excited about is we're recharging the fleet. We're bringing some of our new designs to that existing fleet in selling some pretty nice parts orders to a pretty large fleet of shovels. We're working hard also to potentially turn some of those older equipment  those older shovels into some of our new design. So we think over time India will grow. Will it replace the U.S. in size? No, but India is a significant growth market, and it's all driven by the macroeconomics that the India market needs electricity, and they have a huge poverty issue on electricity there. So we see  its a pretty significant upside in the next five years for us. Ross Gilardi Thank a lot, Ted. Operator We'll go next to Mig Dobre of Robert Baird. Mig Dobre Yes, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I guess maybe going back to U.S. coal and I'm hoping Jim you can help me out here a little bit. So you gave us what I would consider to be some pretty big numbers here, $87 million declines in service revenues, you mentioned service orders being down $70 million year-over-year. If I remember from your prior disclosures, U.S. coal accounted for something like 22% of your fiscal 2015 revenues. So just running that math, it seems to me like U.S. coal is down 50% or thereabouts year-over-year. I'm just trying to understand if I'm thinking about this correctly and what sort of percentage of revenue or bookings at this point does U.S. coal account for?  Jim Sullivan Mig, this is Jim. You're correct with your numbers at the end of last quarter, LTM basis U.S. coal represented about 20% with thermal being about 16%, again LTM basis. As we pull in the second quarter, LTM basis were down to about 18%. Not much change with met coal, that's still around 4% but the thermal coal side has come down to about 14%, so you're correct. The numbers are pretty significant year-over-year down in that segment of the business. Mig Dobre Okay, I appreciate that. And then going back to your guidance here, given that we've got moves of this magnitude, sequentially in the back half of the year, how do you think about U.S. coal? Is it additional deterioration? 2017, you are pretty clear how you're thinking about it. What about the back half? Jim Sullivan Well, clearly the back half is down from what we previously thought because of the production declines that Ted talked about in the market. But again if you look at the first half run rate of production versus the second half, I think everyone expects even if the full year is at that 700 million number that the back half would be up a bit from the first half production was. So down from previous expectation, but we don't see a lot of downside from where we delivered the first half of the year. Now as you know from our discussions, this market is volatile and our customers are reorganizing and that process creates some chunkiness with our business as they secure the support of their constituents and a reorganization process that does have a tendency to slow things down a bit initially, but then once they get the alignment then things pick back up. And we do have customers that are at various stages of that process and so just a bit of caution in terms of the chunkiness of that business but overall if you were to look at the pattern first half versus second half, we wouldn't expect a big change in that segment. Mig Dobre Appreciate it, thanks. Jim Sullivan You bet. Operator We'll go next to Michael Gallo of CL King. Michael Gallo Hi, good morning. I just want to dig in a little bit more on India and the opportunity there, Ted. It would seem that consumptions really been out tripping production by a widening margin over the last five years and it seems like you're more optimistic on this market than I can remember in recent memory. I was wondering if you can frame out whether you see additional increased quotation activity or you think you'll book more systems. I know there is some lumpiness over the next six months to 12 months and whether you can frame out looking out a few years, how big the potential opportunity for Joy might be in India? Thanks. Ted Doheny Okay, well the keyword that you use there was lumpy. We've been working on this particular contract as I mentioned for a number of years and there's more out there as these coal blocks open up. We're pretty selective on the ones we want to go to. We make sure we have the service in place but there's quite a few out there but we hedge India pretty strong. So the activity, if we look at our activity around the world, India is probably the strongest with what we see both on the room and pillar packages, what we see on these long walls. Framing it up though, if we look at this something less than a $100 million on this long wall and room and pillar packages round about $10 million, so we see India over the next five years being definitely in that $0.5 billion opportunity for us and that's what we're driving to. Internally, it's a bigger number but we hedge it back because it takes time. Everything in India takes longer so the quote numbers if we look at our quote logs are actually bigger than that but we think we have a pretty good line of sight to get I'll say multiple long walls and multiple room and pillar packages as well as the surface fleet.  We're going after those shovels as well. We think with what we call our best cost country sourcing strategy leveraging our China supply, but also leveraging some of the local supply opportunities we have in India. So framing it up for you, definitely its $0.5 billion opportunity and we're all over it and it fits into what we do well and I think now that we have that China sourcing opportunity, we can go in there with good margins at the right performance cost solution for the customer, so it's a good opportunity in a really, really tough market, so yes. Michael Gallo Thanks very much, Ted. Operator We'll go next to Steven Fisher of UBS. Steven Fisher Thanks. Good morning. Wonder if you could just give us a little more detail on the oil sands shovel order, how big is it in terms of revenue opportunity, when do you expect delivery of it, would it be another two years like the one you had from 2014 and then is this replacement or expansion? Ted Doheny I'll frame it up. We don't want to give the specifics on it but it's a multiple order less than three, so it's a couple machines going to the oil sands and it's for expansion but it's already planned expansion that's there. These are very, very large facilities basically it's like refinery, so the production plans in place, it's a couple units. We don't frame up the dollar amount but if you took this in the long wall, we're looking at the two of them together north of hundred plus, 120. So roughly frame it up $50 million for the couple of shovels. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, this is tremendous service business because boy they work these things hard. They're in the oil sands so in the summer very loose soil these shovels have to operate on, so very, very wide tracks, very abrasive environment. So it goes through our ground engagement tools literally replace all of the teeth every 48 hours, so very, very demanding application. So as to your question on the timing, this is a planned I think 18 in the next 18 to 24 months so it's scheduled with the other machines as you highlighted we have in the production plan. And by the way as I mentioned the fires, those are still on plan. We had a little bit of a hiccup with the disruption of our team there, but we still believe those that were already on order are still on schedule and no issue with those going forward, so I hope that helps a little color. Steven Fisher Yeah, that's perfect, thank you. And I know you guys are being more strict on past terms with customers. Can you just talk a little bit about how much of your cash flow in the first half of the year was advanced payments and of the 200 to 225 that you expect for the full year, how much do you think of that would be considered advance payments? Ted Doheny We give a lot of detail but we're probably not going to go to that level of detail in terms of the projection Steve but you can look on the cash flow statement on our press release. And if you look at the year-to-date for advanced payments and progress payments that is called out on a line and year-to-date it's minus 6 million. So year-to-date we've generated 160 million of cash from our trade working capital. This is constant currency basis roughly 200 million from the combination of receivables in inventory and we had cash use of about 6 million per advance payments and trade accounts payable, so netting together to 160 million. Just at a high level we would continue to see inventory as a source of cash in the back half of the year, trade accounts receivable not much of a change. We did pull in a lot in the first quarter and that was due to the sequential step down we saw from Q4 2015 to Q1 2016. We were flat in the second quarter and we expect the second half of the year to be approximately flat and then there will be more outflow on advance payments and progress billings, but I'd rather steer clear of an exact number there. Steven Fisher Okay that's helpful, thanks a lot. Ted Doheny You bet. Operator We'll go next to Joe O'Dea of Vertical Research Partners. Joe O'Dea Hi, good morning. First on the higher cost saves that you're targeting for the year, you're saying over 100 million, it sounds like from the carryover that you're targeting for 2017 that that would be more like 130, 135 million of cost saves you're looking at for this year, just want a general sense of whether that's the right way to be thinking about it? Ted Doheny The cost saves this year are going to be less than that. We had said 100 million coming out of the first quarter and we are now saying in excess of 100 million, I wouldn't go 30% higher than where we were. I would go in that 5-10% range. But the actions that we've taken in the second quarter and will continue to take in the back half of the year to position ourselves well for next year are clearly going to have some carryover benefits and we tried to help you out in terms of what we thought that would be in the 40-50 million range. Joe O'Dea Right and thats helpful. And I guess just as you went through the quarter, why these were decided, why you chose to maybe pull these actions forward a little bit or if there were new efforts underway to identify more cost opportunities just to understand you started the year at 85 million and step it up to a 100 and now stepping up even higher, what you did to kind of identify those whether it was previously planned actions or whether this is new stuff that you've gone after? Ted Doheny Well, we're doing everything we can to optimize under the current environment. We're realistic about the business where we're at in the cycle and where its going to go over the next few years. So it's just continued push from us in this tough market. We did see as we talked about the pull-down in terms of U.S. coal production and some of the impacts from the oil sands fires which is really a bit more transitory, but yeah, we are always looking for opportunities to take cost out of the business and we want to do what we can to continue to protect the bottom line. Jim Sullivan Joe, one other piece on that, we're going through the quarters we're trying to be extremely transparent with everyone but also when we're taking action, some of these are significant facilities. So in the last quarter when we shared we were going to take it up to a 100 million that triggered because what we saw specifically as Jim highlighted, what was happening to U.S. coal we had to trigger and pull forward our footprint optimization plan and some of those facilities were significant being in China where we didn't explicitly mention that, those are now been announced underway. And the recent pushing is now over a 100 million, we have better line of sight. We've been through the details, we made the announcement so we see line of sight that we're tracking over that 100 million. And as Jim highlighted it's not to the 130 it's within that 5% to 10% over the hundred, but we have announced them, we have visibility, we know where the plans are, we get the teams in place, tough, tough action but we now have better line of sight to that and these are pretty significant parts of our structure globally. Joe O'Dea Thank you. And then just one more you previously talked about rebuilds that were scheduled for the back half of this year. I think seeing better back activity this year than what you would have had a year ago, just kind of checking to see whether that remains on pace, any changes to some of the anticipated rebuilds that were scheduled for later this year. Jim Sullivan No, it's still the same, what's only different this year is we're tracking every single one. We have the capacity that we're taking capacity offline to get our utilization, so we have some unplanned or not booked I'm sorry rebuilds on the second half of the year we have to go get, but we have pretty good line of sight of that around the world. On the U.S. coal piece, as we highlighted, that 700 million tons that we talked about, the significant reduction in the first half, we sense there could be a pick up on some of that in the second half just because the first half has been down so much but that would be a slight so we see that in the U.S. which is still though we highlighted 18% of our business, it's still a big piece that's important.  The other rebuilds around the world, we did see the stabilization in Australia so we do think we have some pick up on the rebuilds there. South Africa continues to perform well. We have a large fleet there and that one is tied not only to thermal coal and the utility industry that's short but its also tied into the coal to oil which is a big piece of our South African business, so we have a pretty good line of sight on that on the rebuild. And as we highlighted the copper markets, we continue to do well and really, really tough market as well in copper in Latin America. So just going around the world, we see that second half visibility and we're just trying to be careful, it's still a tough market. But we see the line of sight and we still have some work to do to go get though. We don't have it all-in house right now. Joe O'Dea Okay, thanks very much. Operator We'll go next to Lucas Pipes of FBR & Company. Lucas Pipes Hi, good morning, everybody and congrats on a great very good quarter and also the solid bookings. I wanted to follow-up on the bookings side and obviously a good job with oil sands order in India and I wonder what sort of visibility you have as it relates to the sustainability of the bookings, anything kind of that would give you comfort that that's the right ballpark to look at for the second half of the year or maybe even a little bit more than what you just did in Q2? Thank you. Ted Doheny Yes. I have to use the word lumpy there again you know, we try to highlight the lumpiness in the quarter with the oil sands order and the longwall. Looking at the second half, we have prospects that are out there, but in this tough market, we're cautious of what's going, the bookings in the second half of the year. So as far as having a 680 is the new run rate of bookings, that's probably on the high side, getting back in that 500, 550 for the bookings is probably what we're looking at. Not to say that some of these orders could come in. We want to make sure that we highlighted, it's lumpiness that's still going to be out there in front of us. Lucas Pipes Got it, that's helpful, thank you. And then, maybe to go back to the coal side, I'm reading a lot about the restructuring program in China with the reduction of working days consolidation. When you look at what's going on over there do you see overall as an opportunity to maybe take some market share with your technology or should we be thinking about some headwinds just because production is curtailed. How do you think about the developments there? Ted Doheny Im sorry, can you say which area were you looking at first? Lucas Pipes That was in China. Ted Doheny Oh, China, okay, China is tough. As we shared with you the strategy for China is still the same, we're focusing on highly, highly differentiated products for customers who have money and where we get paid. Where we see the market going on our imported product is still for large shares where we have an opportunity to differentiate for some of those huge coal blocks, but it's really the little stuff right now that we're going after. We did in the quarter to get a nice success in China for an armored face conveyor. So that will come in to an existing longwall where we sold the new system, but the imported market is tough. The local market is even tougher. What we're battling to show in China is our localized new products that make a difference. We had a localized continuous miner bolter that we think will change the game. We have customers looking at it. We are bringing references around it, but the market is extremely cash strained right now. So it's going to be a battle in China for awhile. So the success we've had in China in the quarter is just to highlight, the third part of our China strategy is to get our cost base there that wed be and take some of that we call that segment II and segment III product to some of these other growth opportunities around the world and we shipped part of the longwall thats - we will ship part of the longwall going to India from China, as well as the road header. So, China market is just really tough. We are chasing customers where it can pay and have the ability to pay. We're chasing orders where we can differentiate our products and help them lower their cost per ton. So, just tough, tough, tough for us in China right now. Lucas Pipes That's very helpful thank you. Operator We'll go next to Larry Demaria of William Blair. Larry Demaria Hi, good morning, everybody thanks. Ted Doheny Hi, Larry. Larry Demaria Hi. Curious, it sounds like obviously you're winning some of the new business because of price, which is really a function of the lower China cost footprint. So curious on few things, first of all I guess overall price competition what's it like out there and how sustainable is this low cost advantage from what you see in the market. I'm not sure how far ahead of you guys - you guys are ahead of other folks? And then secondly, or thirdly, as far as the portfolio goes, how much are you know being able to source from China say from a couple years ago? Ted Doheny Well Larry let me just correct you, winning it on price or maybe what you said on cost. We are battling extremely hard on product differentiation. So even the oil sands order, just to highlight that one, incredibly competitive. You can imagine in todays market having a shovel opportunity. We went head-to-head against our number one competitor then it went past that we went head-to-head against used equipment; then we had to go head-to-head against China supply. So pricing in todays market is extremely challenging. The reason I'm being clear, I'm not saying we went into discount to get the order. We fought on the differentiator and we actually did time studies and productivity studies in the oil sands that we were able to show a $7 million operating savings which is huge. So, we're battling to show the performance of the product is what we're battling for today to get good margins for this equipment. So, I just want to be really careful that when you say price were not going to cost. Where I mentioned the longwall, where I told you we're bringing in the right cost product using our best cost country sourcing strategy in this case which was China, we looked at what the performance of that longwall was. How many tons per year, tons per month that they're going after and then looking at that with the right cost performance, we were able to leverage our best cost country sourcing supply to meet the order. On that one, we competed with Polish suppliers. So a good margin I just want to be really careful. We're fighting really, really hard for product differentiation and it's a tough market out there. So, I just want to make sure that I was clear on that. To the second part of your question, we're moving the needle on what we're getting out of our China supply. Don't have the percentage on that for you, but that's also part of our cost savings as we're working to see can we get our internal material cost productivity targets. Were leveraging our China team quite a bit and we've been there now for awhile, so we have a pretty good sourcing team there and so we're bringing some pretty good quality components to our facilities around the world. Okay? Larry Demaria Okay that's good, thank you. Ted Doheny Alicia, we can probably have time for one more call. Operator All right we'll go next to Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets. Seth Weber Hi guys, good morning. Ted Doheny Good morning, Seth. Seth Weber Hi. So in some of your prepared comments, and also how you've answered some questions, you both Jim and Ted have referenced trying to find customers in China that will pay or that have money. Can you talk about whats your receivables exposures is looking like in China and if there's been any change to kind of your bad debt experience there? Ted Doheny We're being very selective on the customers that we're going after in that market now. I'll remind you, Seth that we did take a bad debt charge in the fourth quarter of close to $20 million and as we transitioned into FY 2016, we redoubled our focus on making sure that we're dealing with the right customer set. So, I think we're managing it well. If you look at our AR exiting the second quarter, the China domestic receivables would have still been in that low 20% area and our sales are just under 10%. So clearly, that's the market where we have a longer dated receivables. In contrast is the U.S. coal market, which we talked about and we continue to manage down that exposure. Today, again exiting the second quarter, U.S. coal receivables represented about 10% of our total receivables and our sales, we talked about early on an LTM basis are closer to 18%. So those two regions are the push and the pull in terms of the aging of our receivables. Seth Weber Right, okay that's helpful, thank you. And then just lastly I'm trying to just tie together some of your comments about the service bookings in the quarter where they've been trending on an organic basis for the last three or four quarters and your U.S. coal commentary. I mean, do you think at this point it's realistic to think that the service business could be up in 2016? Ted Doheny Up from last year. Seth Weber From a revenue basis, yeah, would you given the bookings trends and your U.S. coal commentary, it sounds like maybe things are stabilizing there in the back half of the year. I'm just - how are you thinking about, sorry go ahead. Ted Doheny No, and I just want to make is sure I understand the question, Seth. As far as 2017 over 2016, I think the market if we look at what we see and look at the same thing, if we look at the CapEx forecast for next year and things are moving to the right and theyre taking the 2017 aggregated CapEx down from our customer base, but what we're looking at is so let's say the core business, the fleet will be challenged. So, we are not giving 2017 guidance, but we think we have an opportunity to drive the initiatives that we should see growth in 2017 if we don't see another step down appreciably over 2016 or 2017. So, if we had the initiatives we get better traction on the consumables we got pretty cool service products out there. We do have stabilization in some of our non-coal markets. We have seen, I didn't talk about this time but maybe next call we'll talk about what's going on with Montabert with the hard rock breakers we see some growth there, but it's going to be initiative driven and it's going to be really tough with the market. We've also seen the share capture, not just with our equipment, but some of the longwalls penetrating, some of our other components. So tough market, long answer for 2017. If we get growth it's because we think we're driving the initiatives. I don't want to forecast the bottom to you is what I'm saying. Seth Weber No, I understand, but just to make sure you're talking about the service business at this point, right? Ted Doheny Correct, yes. Seth Weber Not the total revenue line? Ted Doheny Correct. Seth Weber Okay thank you very much guys, I appreciate it. Ted Doheny Thanks, Seth. Okay, so that's it. I just want to thank everybody for the call and we look forward to talking to all of you next quarter, thank you very much. Alicia, back to you. Operator Thank you, sir.

My name is Kelly and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Viavi Solutions Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen only mode. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Bill Ong, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Bill Ong Thank you, Kelly. Welcome to Viavi Solutions' third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. My name is Bill Ong, Head of Investor Relations. Joining me on todays call are Oleg Khaykin, President and CEO, and Amar Maletira, CFO. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements about the Companys financial performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We encourage you to review our most recent SEC filings, particularly the risk factors described in those filings. The forward-looking statements including guidance we provide during this call are valid only as of today. Viavi undertakes no obligation to update these statements. Please also note that unless we state otherwise, all results except revenue are non-GAAP. We reconcile these non-GAAP results to our preliminary GAAP financials, and discuss their usefulness and limitations in todays earnings release. The release plus our supplementary slides, which include historical financial tables are available on our website. Finally, we are recording todays call and well make the recording available by 4:30 P.M. Pacific Time this evening on the website. I would now like to turn the call over to Amar. Amar Maletira Thank you, Bill. Fiscal Q3 Viavi revenue of $196 million met the guidance midpoint. OSP revenue exceeded the guidance range due to better than expected demand in our anti-counterfeiting business, while NSE revenue was below the guidance range. Viavi revenue declined 11.1% year-over-year, as the growth in the OSP business was offset by the decline in NSE. Viavis operating income at $23.4 million declined 10.7% year-over-year. Operating margin of 11.9% was near the guidance midpoint and flat from the prior year despite lower revenue in fiscal Q3. Overall, Viavi's operating expenses declined 10.6% year-over-year or $11.7 million, driven by expense reductions across the board. EPS at $0.09 exceeded our guidance range of $0.06 to $0.08. The upside to the high end of our guidance range of $0.08 was due to some non-operational benefits. Now, moving to our fiscal third quarter 2017 results by business segment. Starting with NSE. NSE revenue at $132.1 million declined 16.6% year-over-year, driven by a 16% decline in the NE segment, and an 18.5% decline in the SE segment. NSE gross margins at 64.5% increased 100 basis points year-over-year. This was due to 540 basis points of improvement in SE's gross margins at 61.7%, partially offset by a modest decline of 30 basis points in NE's gross margins at 65.3%. NSE operating expense in the quarter was $89.6 million. Despite a 10.9% reduction in NSEs operating expenses from a year ago, we still reported a 3.3% operating loss due to the steep decline in NSE revenue.  During the quarter, we executed a previously announced NSE restructuring plan. In Q3 we reduced approximately 6% of our work force, primarily in the SE business segment. The balance of the 10% work force reduction or the remaining 4% will largely occur in our fiscal Q4 or the June quarter. We're currently ahead of schedule to deliver the targeted annualized net OpEx savings of $35 million. Beyond the stated restructuring plan, we also have additional levers to reduce NSE expenses. The total aggregate charges for this restructuring plan, a majority of which is related to severance is approximately $25 million year-to-date with the balance of up to $5 million to be incurred through the rest of the calendar year 2017. NSE achieved a book to bill ratio above one. Turning to OSP; revenue of $63.9 million increased 2.9% from year-ago levels, driven by an better than expected recovery in our anti-counterfeiting business. Gross margin at 57.4% declined 40 basis points due to product mix. Operating margin of 43.5% improved by 110 basis points from last year, reflecting good management of operating expenses.  Now moving to the balance sheet. Our total cash and short-term investments ending balance was approximately $1.45 billion, with total net cash of 345 million. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $17.3 million. During fiscal Q3 we sold 1.3 million Lumentum shares for a net proceed of $62.1 million, with an average selling price of $48.80 per share. Our book cost basis of these shares is approximately $8.57 per share. As a result, we realized on a GAAP only P&L, an accounting gain of approximately $51.2 million. As of the last day of fiscal Q3, we have remaining 0.4 million shares of Lumentum valued at $20.8 million.  We repurchased a total of 5.2 million shares of Viavi stock during the quarter at a cost basis of $9.91 per share, including commissions for a total of $51.9 million. Of the $150 million share buyback program to-date, we have repurchased shares worth approximately $96 million. We will continue to be opportunistic in monetizing our remaining Lumentum position and repurchasing our Viavi stock. In March, we completed our $460 million senior convertible note offering, which included our initial purchases exercising the overallotment option of 60 million. These notes have a 1% interest rate, a conversion price of $13.22 per share, and will mature in march 2024, unless earlier converted or repurchased. Viavi received $451.2 million in net proceeds. We intend to use these net proceeds together with cash on hand for opportunistically refinancing our outstanding 0.6% to 5% senior convertible notes due 2033, as well as for general corporate purposes. Now on to our guidance. We expect fiscal fourth quarter 2017 revenue for Viavi to be in the range of $188 million to $204 million, operating margin at 13% plus or minus 1%, and EPS to be $0.07 to $0.09. We expect NSE revenue to be at $137 million, plus or minus $6 million with operating margin at 1% plus or minus 1%. We expect OSP revenue to be at $59 million, plus or minus $2 million with operating margin at 41% plus or minus 1%. There was no meaningful 3D sensing revenue in fiscal Q3 and we do not expect it in the current fiscal fourth quarter. While we are seeing the expected recovery in OSP's core revenue in second half fiscal 2017, the anti-counterfeiting demand remains cyclical. Our tax expense is expected to be approximately $5 million. We expect other income and expenses to reflect a net expense of approximately $1.5 million and our share count to be approximately 235 million shares. With that I'll turn the call to Oleg. Oleg Khaykin Thank you, Amar. We exceeded our EPS guidance range as all speaking in above expectations due to a stronger than expected anti-counterfeiting demand, and in part offset weaker than expected NSE revenue that was impacted by weaker service provider and enterprise spend. The March quarter is historically challenging for the NE core instrument business. North American service provider spending was seasonably weak and while there was some instrumentation bind taking place, it was at lower rates than historical. That said, our year-to-date core instruments revenue outside the North America was up nicely year-on-year. Fiber instrument sales softened in the quarter as we saw optical spending starting to grow given the significant amount of fiber deployment over the past 12 to 18 months. Customers are assessing their optical deployment needs as they rebalance their supply demand requirements. On the positive trends, cable demand was meaningfully up as customers finally starting to upgrade to DOCSIS 3.1. We expect cable spending trend to follow a rolling wave pattern and take place over multiple quarters. The access business also saw its first sequential revenue uptick in more than the year. Our service providers are beginning to deploy G.Fast copper access technology. We expect the G.Fast technology adoption also to take place over multiple quarters. The data center or enterprise business came in weaker due to a lackluster enterprise customer spending and some order push out. That said, we expect to see a recovery in this business in the fourth quarter, helped by expected seasonally stronger demand in several deals pushed out from Q3. During Q3, we launched a major restructuring of our service enablement business. Major cost and personnel reduction notwithstanding, we are successfully managing a soft landing for this business as we frame it around a smaller, focused profitable and sustainable core business. Moving on to OSP; the anti-counterfeiting business is rebounding stronger than we expected in the second half of 2017. We expect anti-counterfeiting business to continue to follow its historical cyclicality as our customers rebalance their inventories to match market demand. OSP operating margins were better than expected due to higher revenue levels from a year ago. Regarding 3D sensing, we continue to work with our customers to meet their demand requirements and timelines. As we stated in prior earnings calls, we will provide an update on 3D sensing in our fiscal Q4 earning call in mid-August.  In conclusion, I would like to express my thanks to our customers and employees for their continued support of Viavi. I'll now turn over to Bill. Bill Ong Thank you, Oleg. This quarter well be participating at Stifel Technology Investor Conference in San Francisco on June 5th and William Blair's Growth Investor Conference in Chicago on June 14. Kelly, lets begin the question-and-answer session.  Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Hall from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Rod Hall  Oleg, I wanted to come back to you in a few a little bit and just see if you could get any further color on your visibility there. Obviously that whole carrier spending environment has been pretty volatile. And just help us understand how much confidence you got that these deals do you come back in, in Q4. And also may be talk just a little bit about the trajectory of the OpEx there in NSE. Do you expect that trajectory to continue to come down or what should we be modeling there from an OpEx point of view? Then I have one follow up.  Oleg Khaykin Sure thank you Rod. Well I mean as you can imagine -- well, there is really two stories in NSE right. There is North America and then the rest of the world, right? So our primarily downwards push has really been down in the last, I'd say three quarter by fundamentally pull back of spending by North American operators, and significant M&A activity in both cable and telecom space. So as such, we've seen a lot less willingness to spend money, and clearly that impacted our instrumentation sales. Now in terms of the rest of the world, we've had a very nice growth year to date, year-over-year across all our other geographies in both SE as well as NE. So when I look at it, I say okay well, is it market share loss, is just a systemic lower spend? There is clearly different spending pattern emerging between North American operators and the rest of the world.  I guess some of it is in part because there has been significant spending in North America in 2015, 2016 fiscal years though some of them are now working to digest it, but also because of the significant M&A there is kind of hold on discussions to what to spend, how to spend until the companies figure out what they need. Now that said, the biggest impact was spending on instrumentation at the edge, which is accessing cable, and I would say it was really the story -- I will say behind the June, September and December quarters will be finally now seeing [ph] although its been delayed, we expected it to be sooner -- finally we're seeing the upgrade to DOCSIS 3.1 and G.Fast, and thats starting to pick up the spend among the NSE customers. On the enterprise side, we are seeing pretty healthy demand. We have some very significant deals that just got pushed -- it didnt quite make into the March quarter. But generally, I would say the climate was-- spending was weaker than we thought in the past, although we felt our business was doing pretty well. We expect this quarter to be meaningfully better, and we recognize some of those deals that switch into the fourth quarter and seasonally we see really better spend in the June quarter. And the enterprise business, it's -- kind of June quarter and December quarter are the biggest -- especially December quarter are the biggest cyclical spenders. So thats where we are looking at. And within our service enablement business, clearly we have done significant restructuring. We are actually ahead of our schedule in terms of cost take down and we expect to realize most of it by the end of this fiscal quarter with some trickle remaining through end of the year. having a significant amount of turmoil as you can imagine when you a restructuring business in that kind of magnitude. We actually managed a very nice -- a soft landing with our customer base. We avoided major customer push back and actually we think we worked hard, pretty good transition with all of our key accounts on this price and technology. So in that respect I would say if I were to characterize NSE's biggest headwind last quarter, it was really on the instrumentation and North America services providers. Looking at this quarter, we're actually seeing better climate for instruments. For the first time we got actually book to bill ratio above one. And we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue to build over the year as we are seeing growth in recovery in the access and cable demand which is the edge which is where the biggest volumes are. And although we are seeing some slowdown in fiber -- demand is still fairly healthy, but it's no longer growing quarter on quarter as it did before. So that hopefully gives you more color. Rod Hall  And just really quick follow up. Can you just say whether -- give a yes or no answer. Should we expect revenue in fiscal Q1? Is that when we expect revenue to start and then I know you want to give more detail in the next earnings report. Oleg Khaykin You are talking about 3D sensing unit? Rod Hall  Yes. Oleg Khaykin Okay yes, so you are trying to steal my fourth quarter thunder, but yes we are expected to start shipping production in Q1. So we will see some initial revenue, but the way it generally works is we produce the product, we ship them into the hub. Only as the product gets pulled from the hub and passes incoming inspection, the revenue gets recognized. So there is some lag between the shipment of the product and the time you are going to recognize revenue. So we do expect to start shipping production in Q1. How much of the revenue gets recognized, we are not certain at the time, but the ramp will happen -- I'll say between Q1, Q2, and Q3 of next fiscal year. Operator Your next question comes from Dmitry Netis of William Blair. Your line is open. Dmitry Netis Thank you very much guys, nice results and I would say pretty decent guidance given the environment we're in. I have a couple of questions. One I just want to kind get a little clarification on the instrumentation side of the business. Oleg can you, if I were to sort of ask for you to kind of give me a product mix there, if I combine cable and access in one category and then fiber and maybe everything else in another, is that a roughly 50-50 split? Anything you can tell us just to guide -- see the magnitude of the cable access business starting to reaccelerate here for you and how impactful it may be going forward? Oleg Khaykin All right. We dont give the mix but as you can imagine, if you combine cable and access, you could actually say its all access right, the edge -- there is the single biggest bucket because of the volume at the edge. So I dont want to go and start providing the mix but cable and access is a significant chunk of revenue right? Fiber is somewhat smaller than combination of the cable and access, and the rest would be metal. So the biggest, if I would look at the cable and access to say 2 years ago, that was easily over 50% of the revenue right? So there is been significant pull back as customers say hey, why am I going to buy equipment if I'm going to be transitioning to 3.1 DOCSIS and G.Fast while throwing to the mix significant amount of M&A, some slippage on schedules, and that revenue dropped significantly in the past three quarters or so. And just now finally in this fiscal third quarter, we are starting to see a pullback in both of these product lines and volumes starting to increase the DOCSIS 3.1 and G.Fast are trying to ramp.  Dmitry Netis Okay great and my follow up is one for Oleg, one for Amar. I guess on the -- I just want to get some clarity on the data center business. I suppose that's the network instruments business. Continue to kind dive in, can you explain what exactly is happening? I thought that business was starting to pick up for you because of the changes you had made recently, has something else happened there affected it? Number one. Number two is how is the channel doing? If you could comment quickly on the channel program you put in place? Are you still happy with the sales leads that you generate from there. And then lastly to Amar. I just want to pick your brain on a convertible note and see when you think you will be back on the market, maybe buying the old convert out and how you feel about keeping the two converts on the books at the moment for whatever reason? I dont know if its the M&A thoughts you have or is something else. But you'd need to maintain that level of cash on the balance sheet but just give us some plug there. Oleg Khaykin You squeezed in about four questions in one. We will go ahead and do that. On enterprise, actually we still feel very good about that business. We just introduced to you a revamped product platform. Our new organization, our sales force, I think three quarters of it is less than couple of quarters on board. And we are seeing very good traction. So as ugly as the March quarter came in, I actually feel pretty good about this business for several reasons. First, March is usually the weakest quarter because their busiest and biggest quarter is typically in December. But even in this March quarter we saw some -- a lot of I would call first. We actually were getting deals in the seven-digit range that we never were getting in the past. And we won them. So we are now winning some serious type of business. But also with that kind of serious business, if one of those deals slips from quarter-to-quarter, it hurts meaningfully. So I think I would say -- I dont want to make excuses for that business, but clearly as I look at the trajectory and I look at the bookings pipeline that they are building, its all in the right direction. I am not going to hold it against them if they got some bookings relatively late and we just couldnt get it to customer in time. But I think the organization is performing well, the product line doing well and I'm optimistic on that business unit going forward. And this quarter is obviously going to be a good quarter for them. They have some of these yields that slipped coming this quarter plus they have quite a few nice design wins. So they are going to drive -- we expect a nice revenue from them. So I think its a business that's still transition. It's still in turnaround mode, but qualitatively I like all the indicators that I am seeing. And we will give them time to accelerate. Amar Maletira On the convert and what we are doing about it, as you know, we issued a new convert firstly refinance the existing converts, and secondly to give us some flexibility from a capital allocation perspective. So we saw the opportunity, took advantage of very favorable market conditions to lock in a local pond rate at a higher conversion price. Now we do have internal plans here, Dmitry and I won't talk specifically on the timing et cetera, but our internal plans have various options. One is, we want to opportunistically go and buyback the old converts on the conditions that appropriate. We do have certain criteria that we have set upside. Number two, we can call it on the first good it date of August 20, 2018, and when we call it, we have the flexibility to either settle in cash or stock any amount of the stock above the conversion price. And number three is as you can see, we are opportunistically also buying back our shares through existing share buyback program so that if there is a double dilution, we could try and offset the dilution proactively. So you can be assured as we have done in the past with our capital allocation, we have stated capital allocation goals and priorities and we have executed against it. And we will do so even in this case. But it was -- our new converts was essentially to refinance our existing converts and we will do that opportunistically since we still have about 14, 15 months to go. Dmitry Netis And my first question was in consolidation and M&A? Any comment there real quick? Amar Maletira We dont comment on these things. Operator Your next question comes from Patrick Newton of Stifel. Your line is open. Patrick Newton Just wanted to focus on the cyclicality of the OSP business, which you brought up in your prepared remarks. Is a $60 million run rate in the FY'18 for the full year I guess there a realistic quarterly level? And I guess the reason I'm asking, I'm trying to understand if the results and guidance represent kind of a high-water mark for the OSP business from a cyclical perspective or could you still grow from here? Amar Maletira I think I dont want to guide fiscal year '18, but just building on my comment, when we said it will revert back to the cyclical demand, we believe mid-50 to high-50s is the core business. Thats quarterly revenue range that you should be thinking about. Now 3D would be on top of that, but the core business should be mid-50s to high-50s. Patrick Newton Great, thats helpful. And then I guess just looking at the NSE business, I wanted to kind of pick apart the sequential guide. Given the commentary that you had around the NE business benefiting from enterprise push outs and then you also spoke to momentum building for cable and G.Fast. Should we expect that the SE business will decline sequentially in the June quarter, or could be see both sub segments grow? Amar Maletira Well I think thats a very good question. When you look at our guidance for NSE, the NSE revenue guidance calls for a 3.7% sequential growth, so roughly about 4% sequential growth at the midpoint. Now within that, as Oleg mentioned we are seeing some momentum. As you see our book to bill was greater than one. So what we have done is the NE business its projected to actually go up mid-single digit sequentially. On the flip side, the SE restructuring to scale down some of our unprofitable product lines impacts the SE revenues. So SE revenue is declining sequentially, sort of double digits, whereas the NE business is projected to be up mid-single digit.  Patrick Newton And then any color you can give around SE as we look into 2018 given the restructuring? Oleg Khaykin Clearly when you take out the amount of cost we're taking out, our whole thing about SE is first really about quality of revenue rather than quantity. So by taking out the significant cost and shutting down the product lines where dont feel there is a positive upside, we do expect some pull back. Its not a very big pull back from a current run rate and we would prefer to give guidance more when we give 2018 guidance in fourth quarter. But the way I look at it, its actually overall a net major positive. Yes, we're going to lose some low-quality revenue but we're going to have a significant increase in the operating through fall for that business unit, and get it at the very minimum to the break even or profitable. Amar Maletira It's all about profitable revenue, and if you recall Patrick what we mentioned, maybe last call as well as during the Analyst Day, SE as a percentage of the total mix of NSE is around low-20s to high 20% of the total mix of NSE. As we go restructure and make it more profitable, we expect it to be between 15% and 20% by fiscal year '19 and fiscal year '18 should be more towards the 20% as a percentage of the total mix.  Operator Your next question comes from Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is open. Alex Henderson  I just wanted to go back to the breakout NE and SE for a second. So if I take the numbers you just gave, 5% sequential growth in SE and take the network enablement down by double digits, I'm actually coming out with numbers that are below that low end of your band. I was wondering if you could just make sure that you said that correctly or I heard it correctly.  Oleg Khaykin So sequentially you will see our NE business grow mid-single digits within the guidance and SE business -- so you're right, SE business will be mid to high single digit decline, not double digit decline. So you are absolutely right.  Alex Henderson  So I thought you said the NE was going to decline, not the other way around sorry. Oleg Khaykin [Multiple speakers] year-over-year not quarter-on-quarter. Amar Maletira NE is going to grow mid-single digit sequentially. SE is going to decline mid to high single digit sequentially. And the overall revenue growth for SE year-on-year is going to be double digit decline. Alex Henderson  Going back to the business in OSP segment for a second. So you obviously had a pretty good spike in margins there or in revenues there, and I assume that translates a little bit more of a spike in margins that the bottom line. As we go back into the $58 million, $59 million a quarter range from the $64 million here in the March quarter, would we then expect some contraction than the operating margins back towards the 40% range? Amar Maletira I think it will be -- so we always guided between 39% and 41% for the OSP business. And what we believe is given all the operating expense reduction as well as the gross margin focus in that business, we should be more towards the high end of the range, of between 39% and 41%. Oleg Khaykin Probably 40% is the same Amar Maletira 40% is the midpoint, more biased towards the high end. Alex Henderson  So I was just really referring to the -- I know you dont want to give guidance going out, but as you had said mid to upper 50s, and revenues there I assumed thats associating with the midpoint of that 39% to 41% range. Amar Maletira I would say given all the cost work and efficiency work they are doing, it should be more towards the high end. Oleg Khaykin Yes, I think traditionally we have always guided high 40s to low 40s. I think given what the team has done and all the improvements they put in place, we comparably to -- when they run at their steady state for them should be at the higher end, which is 40% 41%. Amar Maletira Thats right. And then once we have 3D coming in, I think that should take the margin rate down, and -- below 40%, but it should be operating profit dollar accretive. Alex Henderson  So just going back to the cost cutting program. So it sounds like there is pretty good slug that came out in the March quarter. You've also got a pretty good slug coming out in the June quarter. So I should be -- just thinking about OpEx declining sequentially, continuing to decline sequentially into the September quarter, is that the right way to think about it? Amar Maletira Yes, thats right. So let me just recap. So when we announced the restructuring last quarter, we baselined the $35 million of net OpEx savings to our Q2 NSE OpEx of $95.7 million, which is a December OpEx of $95.7 million. So we've said, that's baseline versus the baseline we will reduce $35 million of annualized OpEx which is 8.75 million per quarter -- that is the quarterly OpEx reductions. Now we have gone from $95.7 million to 89.6 million in Q3 and in Q4 we should be getting almost 90% or more of that savings. You should definitely expect a sequential reduction from Q3 to Q4, and thats all incorporated in our guidance. Operator Your next question comes from James Kisner from Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst Hey guys David [indiscernible] for James. I just want to clarify; did you guys have any impact on the NSE margins during fiscal Q3 from the restructuring or is this really just a fixed cost absorption which resulted in op income margin you are seeing below what you guys have thought? Amar Maletira We did get benefit from the SE restructuring in our margins in fiscal Q3. But also keep in mind we did have a big impact from a steep decline in revenue. So that steep decline in revenue in the NE business offset the margin improvements in fiscal Q3. So when the revenue comes back up, I think thats going to create a positive operating leverage in the model.  Unidentified Analyst Okay thank you, then just on 3D sensing, without getting in too much detail, it sounds like you guys are very confident that you will start shipping in fiscal 1Q. Is that, I mean if you guys are shipping to the hub, is there a chance at the part, that the filters could then sit in the hub for a potentially another product cycle or how do you guys think about that in terms of when it gets pulled out, and you guys have started recognizing revenue.  Oleg Khaykin So when we had our Analyst Day there was a lot of talk about, everybody talking about 3D and one. We back then said listen, its surely to talk about it. We will talk about it as we get closer to it because all along we knew that we're not going to see hardly any shipments until first quarter of fiscal 2018, right? So we do expect to optionally do start seeing revenue in the Q1, because its a -- you dont ship into a hub unless there is a demand, right? So it's basically the hub is purely there to ensure just in time, make sure that everybody ships the part that they need, and they pull to inspect and they consume. So a lot of the time, and I dont know this particular supply chain. I will obviously learn a lot more once we start shipping. But typically, with these kinds of deals where I had with my other businesses I ran in the past, products dont spend more than a week in the hub. It's always continuously churning of the product.  Unidentified Analyst Okay thats very helpful. So it sounds you guys feel very confident about 3D sensing business moving forward in that timeframe. Oleg Khaykin Yes, you know the thing is, when you look at it in most of the revenue, for most things, once it leaves the factory, you recognize the revenue. In this particular case its a -- you push the revenue recognition line towards incoming inspection acceptance, rather than leaving the back of your factory.  Unidentified Analyst Okay great and just one last quick question for me, did you guys see any increase in the prepayments that you guys first announced, I believe it was three quarters ago now.  Oleg Khaykin Nothing worth commenting.  Operator Your next question comes from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.  Meta Marshall  I just wanted to go into a little bit of the visibility on NSE and just a sense of the timeline between when you might know that the carrier is going to deploy G.Fast or DOCSIS 3.1 or fiber into a certain city, and then kind when you would expect to see that equipment around the new, just that tend to be three months, six months, just a little bit about that timeline. And the second question would just being the prepayment you received last year, where there any restrictions as far as other partners that you could work with or is it unrestricted? Oleg Khaykin So with that, the first question was on NSE. Amar Maletira Timeline of the cabling.. Oleg Khaykin The way we know all the players both on cable and telecom side, and their conversion to the DOCSIS 3.1 or G.Fast right. So we roughly know who is doing it. How are they doing it is really a quarter-to-quarter decision, how they do it. And mean our visibility on it is probably at most three months. So we know it's going to happen. In which sequence and where it happens is really subject to their capital decision on quarterly basis within our service provider accounts. So for example, G.Fast, I mean we have seen -- G.Fast happening already in some U.S. and European accounts, but its -- they are not really just flipping the switch and exchanging everybody. Its more like gradually, like successive ways spread over multiple quarters. But one of the things if you follow the equipment provider out reporting, you see they usually get a big pop in orders within one to two quarters, because those are the things our customers need to do to upgrade their central offices. But once they are upgraded, they can actually rollout new modems at a leisurely pace because all of them are backwards compatible. So the retrofit takes time over a longer period of time than the second central office. And instrumentation is pulled largely at the pace of the conversion of modems. So in that respect we know that it's going to happen. It's not the question of if. It's really a question of when and that is kind of one of these things every quarter they tell us what they are going to do and there is very little long term visibility. So that hopefully answers your first question. And second one no, any prepayments we take does not limit us from working with anybody else. And from our perspective, prepayment is really function of the level of risk in capital or business risk that we are being asked to take by a customer. Clearly the risk is modest within -- fixed within our internal operational guidelines. We dont look for prepayments but if its a significant step up in the capital or production capacity, then we definitely look for a prepayment. Operator Your last question comes from [indiscernible] from Craig Hallum Capital. Your line is open. And the caller has removed himself from the queue. So I'll now turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. Oleg Khaykin Thank you Kelly. This concludes our earnings call for today. And thank you everyone.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Hall from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Rod Hall  Oleg, I wanted to come back to you in a few a little bit and just see if you could get any further color on your visibility there. Obviously that whole carrier spending environment has been pretty volatile. And just help us understand how much confidence you got that these deals do you come back in, in Q4. And also may be talk just a little bit about the trajectory of the OpEx there in NSE. Do you expect that trajectory to continue to come down or what should we be modeling there from an OpEx point of view? Then I have one follow up.  Oleg Khaykin Sure thank you Rod. Well I mean as you can imagine -- well, there is really two stories in NSE right. There is North America and then the rest of the world, right? So our primarily downwards push has really been down in the last, I'd say three quarter by fundamentally pull back of spending by North American operators, and significant M&A activity in both cable and telecom space. So as such, we've seen a lot less willingness to spend money, and clearly that impacted our instrumentation sales. Now in terms of the rest of the world, we've had a very nice growth year to date, year-over-year across all our other geographies in both SE as well as NE. So when I look at it, I say okay well, is it market share loss, is just a systemic lower spend? There is clearly different spending pattern emerging between North American operators and the rest of the world.  I guess some of it is in part because there has been significant spending in North America in 2015, 2016 fiscal years though some of them are now working to digest it, but also because of the significant M&A there is kind of hold on discussions to what to spend, how to spend until the companies figure out what they need. Now that said, the biggest impact was spending on instrumentation at the edge, which is accessing cable, and I would say it was really the story -- I will say behind the June, September and December quarters will be finally now seeing [ph] although its been delayed, we expected it to be sooner -- finally we're seeing the upgrade to DOCSIS 3.1 and G.Fast, and thats starting to pick up the spend among the NSE customers. On the enterprise side, we are seeing pretty healthy demand. We have some very significant deals that just got pushed -- it didnt quite make into the March quarter. But generally, I would say the climate was-- spending was weaker than we thought in the past, although we felt our business was doing pretty well. We expect this quarter to be meaningfully better, and we recognize some of those deals that switch into the fourth quarter and seasonally we see really better spend in the June quarter. And the enterprise business, it's -- kind of June quarter and December quarter are the biggest -- especially December quarter are the biggest cyclical spenders. So thats where we are looking at. And within our service enablement business, clearly we have done significant restructuring. We are actually ahead of our schedule in terms of cost take down and we expect to realize most of it by the end of this fiscal quarter with some trickle remaining through end of the year. having a significant amount of turmoil as you can imagine when you a restructuring business in that kind of magnitude. We actually managed a very nice -- a soft landing with our customer base. We avoided major customer push back and actually we think we worked hard, pretty good transition with all of our key accounts on this price and technology. So in that respect I would say if I were to characterize NSE's biggest headwind last quarter, it was really on the instrumentation and North America services providers. Looking at this quarter, we're actually seeing better climate for instruments. For the first time we got actually book to bill ratio above one. And we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue to build over the year as we are seeing growth in recovery in the access and cable demand which is the edge which is where the biggest volumes are. And although we are seeing some slowdown in fiber -- demand is still fairly healthy, but it's no longer growing quarter on quarter as it did before. So that hopefully gives you more color. Rod Hall  And just really quick follow up. Can you just say whether -- give a yes or no answer. Should we expect revenue in fiscal Q1? Is that when we expect revenue to start and then I know you want to give more detail in the next earnings report. Oleg Khaykin You are talking about 3D sensing unit? Rod Hall  Yes.

Amar Maletira I think I dont want to guide fiscal year '18, but just building on my comment, when we said it will revert back to the cyclical demand, we believe mid-50 to high-50s is the core business. Thats quarterly revenue range that you should be thinking about. Now 3D would be on top of that, but the core business should be mid-50s to high-50s. Patrick Newton Great, thats helpful. And then I guess just looking at the NSE business, I wanted to kind of pick apart the sequential guide. Given the commentary that you had around the NE business benefiting from enterprise push outs and then you also spoke to momentum building for cable and G.Fast. Should we expect that the SE business will decline sequentially in the June quarter, or could be see both sub segments grow? Amar Maletira Well I think thats a very good question. When you look at our guidance for NSE, the NSE revenue guidance calls for a 3.7% sequential growth, so roughly about 4% sequential growth at the midpoint. Now within that, as Oleg mentioned we are seeing some momentum. As you see our book to bill was greater than one. So what we have done is the NE business its projected to actually go up mid-single digit sequentially. On the flip side, the SE restructuring to scale down some of our unprofitable product lines impacts the SE revenues. So SE revenue is declining sequentially, sort of double digits, whereas the NE business is projected to be up mid-single digit.  Patrick Newton And then any color you can give around SE as we look into 2018 given the restructuring? Oleg Khaykin Clearly when you take out the amount of cost we're taking out, our whole thing about SE is first really about quality of revenue rather than quantity. So by taking out the significant cost and shutting down the product lines where dont feel there is a positive upside, we do expect some pull back. Its not a very big pull back from a current run rate and we would prefer to give guidance more when we give 2018 guidance in fourth quarter. But the way I look at it, its actually overall a net major positive. Yes, we're going to lose some low-quality revenue but we're going to have a significant increase in the operating through fall for that business unit, and get it at the very minimum to the break even or profitable. Amar Maletira It's all about profitable revenue, and if you recall Patrick what we mentioned, maybe last call as well as during the Analyst Day, SE as a percentage of the total mix of NSE is around low-20s to high 20% of the total mix of NSE. As we go restructure and make it more profitable, we expect it to be between 15% and 20% by fiscal year '19 and fiscal year '18 should be more towards the 20% as a percentage of the total mix.  Operator Your next question comes from Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is open. Alex Henderson  I just wanted to go back to the breakout NE and SE for a second. So if I take the numbers you just gave, 5% sequential growth in SE and take the network enablement down by double digits, I'm actually coming out with numbers that are below that low end of your band. I was wondering if you could just make sure that you said that correctly or I heard it correctly.  Oleg Khaykin So sequentially you will see our NE business grow mid-single digits within the guidance and SE business -- so you're right, SE business will be mid to high single digit decline, not double digit decline. So you are absolutely right.  Alex Henderson  So I thought you said the NE was going to decline, not the other way around sorry. Oleg Khaykin [Multiple speakers] year-over-year not quarter-on-quarter. Amar Maletira NE is going to grow mid-single digit sequentially. SE is going to decline mid to high single digit sequentially. And the overall revenue growth for SE year-on-year is going to be double digit decline. Alex Henderson  Going back to the business in OSP segment for a second. So you obviously had a pretty good spike in margins there or in revenues there, and I assume that translates a little bit more of a spike in margins that the bottom line. As we go back into the $58 million, $59 million a quarter range from the $64 million here in the March quarter, would we then expect some contraction than the operating margins back towards the 40% range? Amar Maletira I think it will be -- so we always guided between 39% and 41% for the OSP business. And what we believe is given all the operating expense reduction as well as the gross margin focus in that business, we should be more towards the high end of the range, of between 39% and 41%. Oleg Khaykin Probably 40% is the same Amar Maletira 40% is the midpoint, more biased towards the high end. Alex Henderson  So I was just really referring to the -- I know you dont want to give guidance going out, but as you had said mid to upper 50s, and revenues there I assumed thats associating with the midpoint of that 39% to 41% range. Amar Maletira I would say given all the cost work and efficiency work they are doing, it should be more towards the high end. Oleg Khaykin Yes, I think traditionally we have always guided high 40s to low 40s. I think given what the team has done and all the improvements they put in place, we comparably to -- when they run at their steady state for them should be at the higher end, which is 40% 41%. Amar Maletira Thats right. And then once we have 3D coming in, I think that should take the margin rate down, and -- below 40%, but it should be operating profit dollar accretive. Alex Henderson  So just going back to the cost cutting program. So it sounds like there is pretty good slug that came out in the March quarter. You've also got a pretty good slug coming out in the June quarter. So I should be -- just thinking about OpEx declining sequentially, continuing to decline sequentially into the September quarter, is that the right way to think about it? Amar Maletira Yes, thats right. So let me just recap. So when we announced the restructuring last quarter, we baselined the $35 million of net OpEx savings to our Q2 NSE OpEx of $95.7 million, which is a December OpEx of $95.7 million. So we've said, that's baseline versus the baseline we will reduce $35 million of annualized OpEx which is 8.75 million per quarter -- that is the quarterly OpEx reductions. Now we have gone from $95.7 million to 89.6 million in Q3 and in Q4 we should be getting almost 90% or more of that savings. You should definitely expect a sequential reduction from Q3 to Q4, and thats all incorporated in our guidance. Operator Your next question comes from James Kisner from Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst Hey guys David [indiscernible] for James. I just want to clarify; did you guys have any impact on the NSE margins during fiscal Q3 from the restructuring or is this really just a fixed cost absorption which resulted in op income margin you are seeing below what you guys have thought? Amar Maletira We did get benefit from the SE restructuring in our margins in fiscal Q3. But also keep in mind we did have a big impact from a steep decline in revenue. So that steep decline in revenue in the NE business offset the margin improvements in fiscal Q3. So when the revenue comes back up, I think thats going to create a positive operating leverage in the model.  Unidentified Analyst Okay thank you, then just on 3D sensing, without getting in too much detail, it sounds like you guys are very confident that you will start shipping in fiscal 1Q. Is that, I mean if you guys are shipping to the hub, is there a chance at the part, that the filters could then sit in the hub for a potentially another product cycle or how do you guys think about that in terms of when it gets pulled out, and you guys have started recognizing revenue.  Oleg Khaykin So when we had our Analyst Day there was a lot of talk about, everybody talking about 3D and one. We back then said listen, its surely to talk about it. We will talk about it as we get closer to it because all along we knew that we're not going to see hardly any shipments until first quarter of fiscal 2018, right? So we do expect to optionally do start seeing revenue in the Q1, because its a -- you dont ship into a hub unless there is a demand, right? So it's basically the hub is purely there to ensure just in time, make sure that everybody ships the part that they need, and they pull to inspect and they consume. So a lot of the time, and I dont know this particular supply chain. I will obviously learn a lot more once we start shipping. But typically, with these kinds of deals where I had with my other businesses I ran in the past, products dont spend more than a week in the hub. It's always continuously churning of the product.  Unidentified Analyst Okay thats very helpful. So it sounds you guys feel very confident about 3D sensing business moving forward in that timeframe. Oleg Khaykin Yes, you know the thing is, when you look at it in most of the revenue, for most things, once it leaves the factory, you recognize the revenue. In this particular case its a -- you push the revenue recognition line towards incoming inspection acceptance, rather than leaving the back of your factory.  Unidentified Analyst Okay great and just one last quick question for me, did you guys see any increase in the prepayments that you guys first announced, I believe it was three quarters ago now.  Oleg Khaykin Nothing worth commenting.  Operator Your next question comes from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.  Meta Marshall  I just wanted to go into a little bit of the visibility on NSE and just a sense of the timeline between when you might know that the carrier is going to deploy G.Fast or DOCSIS 3.1 or fiber into a certain city, and then kind when you would expect to see that equipment around the new, just that tend to be three months, six months, just a little bit about that timeline. And the second question would just being the prepayment you received last year, where there any restrictions as far as other partners that you could work with or is it unrestricted? Oleg Khaykin So with that, the first question was on NSE. Amar Maletira Timeline of the cabling.. Oleg Khaykin The way we know all the players both on cable and telecom side, and their conversion to the DOCSIS 3.1 or G.Fast right. So we roughly know who is doing it. How are they doing it is really a quarter-to-quarter decision, how they do it. And mean our visibility on it is probably at most three months. So we know it's going to happen. In which sequence and where it happens is really subject to their capital decision on quarterly basis within our service provider accounts. So for example, G.Fast, I mean we have seen -- G.Fast happening already in some U.S. and European accounts, but its -- they are not really just flipping the switch and exchanging everybody. Its more like gradually, like successive ways spread over multiple quarters. But one of the things if you follow the equipment provider out reporting, you see they usually get a big pop in orders within one to two quarters, because those are the things our customers need to do to upgrade their central offices. But once they are upgraded, they can actually rollout new modems at a leisurely pace because all of them are backwards compatible. So the retrofit takes time over a longer period of time than the second central office. And instrumentation is pulled largely at the pace of the conversion of modems. So in that respect we know that it's going to happen. It's not the question of if. It's really a question of when and that is kind of one of these things every quarter they tell us what they are going to do and there is very little long term visibility. So that hopefully answers your first question. And second one no, any prepayments we take does not limit us from working with anybody else. And from our perspective, prepayment is really function of the level of risk in capital or business risk that we are being asked to take by a customer. Clearly the risk is modest within -- fixed within our internal operational guidelines. We dont look for prepayments but if its a significant step up in the capital or production capacity, then we definitely look for a prepayment. Operator Your last question comes from [indiscernible] from Craig Hallum Capital. Your line is open. And the caller has removed himself from the queue. So I'll now turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. Oleg Khaykin Thank you Kelly. This concludes our earnings call for today. And thank you everyone.

(NASDAQ: LAMR ) Q1 2017 Earnings Call May 04, 2017 9:00 am ET Executives Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Keith Istre - Lamar Advertising Co. Analysts Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC David W. Miller - Loop Capital Markets LLC Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Maria Ripps - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Operator Excuse me, everyone. We now have Sean Reilly and Keith Istre in conference. Please be aware that each of your line is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of the company's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. In the course of this discussion, Lamar may make forward-looking statements regarding the company, including statements about its future financial performance, strategic goals, plans, and objectives, including with respect to the amount and timing of any distributions to stockholders. All forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties, and contingencies, many of which are beyond Lamar's control, and which may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. Lamar has identified important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this call in the company's first quarter 2017 earnings release, and its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated or supplemented by its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Lamar refers you to those documents. Lamar's first quarter 2017 earnings release, which contains information required by Regulation G regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures, was furnished to the SEC on a Form 8-K this morning and is available on the Investors section of Lamar's website, www.lamar.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Sean Reilly. Mr. Reilly, you may begin. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Thanks, Katy. And welcome, all, to Lamar's Q1 earnings call. As I mentioned in the release, the tone of business is improving. Pacings for Q2 are stronger than Q1 results. I would describe our expectations for Q2 acquisition-adjusted growth as up 2-ish. In addition, we expect expense growth to moderate to more customary levels as the year progresses. We also expect maintenance CapEx to come in at plus or minus $40 million. We are consequently maintaining our previous guidance for 2017 AFFO per share. Keith will give you more detail on the unusual Q1 expense items and the timing of maintenance CapEx that affected Q1 AFFO, after which I will touch on the usual operating metrics followed by Q&A. Keith? Keith Istre - Lamar Advertising Co. Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everybody. There were a couple of expenses in the first quarter of 2017 that were not in Q1 that contributed to our expense growth in the quarter. I'll just walk through them briefly. First of all, legal fees at corporate were up $600,000 over last year's first quarter. On our airport division, the revenue sharing increased $800,000 in Q1 over Q1 of last year. And we had an increase in workmen's comp claims of $1.1 million that we did not have last year. Workmen's comp, of course, is, at times, the luck of the draw, accidents happen. And as much as we try to control that through our safety program, sometimes bad things happen. Anyway, that's kind of a recap on the expenses. Maintenance CapEx, you saw, we came in at about $9.5 million versus $6.5 million last year. Maintenance CapEx, as it is growth CapEx, is a timing thing. It doesn't mean that we're on track to spend more this year than last year because we were up approximately $3 million in the first quarter. $1 million of that was IT hardware that we had planned for. That was spent in the first quarter. It was equipment that we needed to replace old equipment in our IT shop. So that was a one-time expense that won't be reoccurring. But as Sean said, we're looking at a run rate of $40 million for the year. Sean? Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Great. Thanks, Keith. Hitting a couple of the operating metrics. Digital same-board revenue increased 1% in Q1 of 2017 over Q1 of 2016. Our national, local sales mix in Q1 of 2017 was, we were 79% local, 21% national. And as we mentioned on our call three months ago, our national was actually a little stronger in Q1. Q1 national was up approximately 5%, local was down approximately 1%. And again, as we said three months ago, we don't expect the year to play out that way. Looking forward through the end of the year, it looks like local and national should make roughly equal contributions to our pro forma growth by the time we close out the year. I'm going to spend a little more time on the verticals just because that kind of color seems to be of interest, given the way ad spend is playing out so far in 2017. Our largest category of business is service. That was up 10% in Q1 this year over last year. Healthcare was down 5% Q1 this year under Q1 of last year. A little color on that. We continue to believe that the political uncertainty around the ACA is causing our healthcare customers to be a little bit cautious in their ad spend. Retail was up 3% in Q1. Amusement, entertainment and sports was up 11% in Q1. Automotive was down 1% in Q1. Education, another vertical that has struggled of late, was down 9% in Q1. And telecom, which represents 3% of our business, it's last of our top 10 verticals, was up 23% in Q1. That, again, was a little bit of an anomaly in timing and probably resulted in that outperformance for us in national. So, with that color on the verticals, Katy, let's open it up for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you, sir. Our first question will come from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Sean, you have completely different trends in national than pretty much anyone we've heard so far. So can you just talk about what's driving national? I realize that it's a small part of the business, but it's the reason why you're up. And then, the second question I have is, you keep sharing about a little more confidence in the second half of the year in terms of the ad trends. What's your visibility into the second half of the year at this point, without giving us official guidance? Does it seem to be accelerating? Thanks. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Sure. So, yeah, we look a little bit different than our counterparts, Clear and Outfront. And in visiting with John Miller, our Head of National Sales, about where ours came from, it pretty much confirms what they are seeing in the top five DMAs. We're down, for example, in Chicago and New York, but we're up in national and middle markets. So I think it's an anomaly, driven by where national clients are putting their business. They're buying a little deeper, and they're bypassing some of the major metros. In terms of verticals, it was pretty clear. Telecom was a major part of that. So, Verizon and AT&T were spending pretty big, again, in those DMAs 10 through 75, let's call it. I think we also got a lift in those same DMAs from beverage. Coca-Cola came in pretty good for us. On the downside, we took a little hit in the beer category. But when you added it all up, I think it was a function of where they were buying, where they were putting their ad spend, not so much a function of how much they were spending. As we look at the back half of the year and what remains to be sold through 2017, let me sort of relate it to our AFFO guidance, because what we're assuming are not really heroic things. For us to hit the bottom of our AFFO range, we need to have pro forma revenue growth of 2%-and-some-change, by the time we close out 2017. We need to make sure expenses don't get away from us. We need expense growth in that same range of 2%-and-some-change. And then, we need maintenance CapEx to come in at plus or minus $40 million. And that's sort of the simple recipe to get us to our guidance. And those things appear to us, at all the data points we're looking at, to be doable. So we're cautiously maintaining our guidance and we think that 2017 is still intact. Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Can I just ask one follow-up? Are you taking share in your market from any other media? Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. I believe we are. It's not big numbers, Marci. I think you can look at what's going on with other media and the numbers they're reporting. And clearly, they're losing share. Most of that is going to the Googles and Facebooks of the world. But because we're growing in the face of a shrinking ad pie for traditional media, by definition, we're taking a little bit of share. Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from David Miller of Loop Capital Markets. David W. Miller - Loop Capital Markets LLC Yeah. Hey, guys. Sean, nice to see you guys maintain your guidance. Just wanted to ask about acquisitions for a second. The balance sheet looks like it's just in absolutely perfect shape. Net debt-to-EBITDA can't really be any more perfect than it already is. It feels to me like you guys have integrated the Clear Channel acquisition from, not this past January, but the January prior, pretty well. How do you feel about tuck-in deals going forward, just given that the balance sheet looks like there's capacity to do deals? Thanks a lot. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Yeah. Thanks, David. I think, on the tuck-in acquisition front, this is going to kind of be a steady-as-she-goes here. As you know, when you take a look at our free cash flow after everything, after all CapEx, after interest, after the distribution, we have a little more than $100 million left over at the end of the day. David W. Miller - Loop Capital Markets LLC Yes. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. It feels to us like that's about what we'll deploy this year, absent something bigger coming up. Just kind of feels like a sort of steady-as-she-goes tuck-in year for 2017. David W. Miller - Loop Capital Markets LLC Okay, wonderful. Thank you very much. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Yeah. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. I just had a broader question on your national/local mix. Is that more a function of just the location of your facings? Or is it a particular way you sort of array your sales force to go after sort of easier dollars in the local market? Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Yeah. Thanks, Jason. It's the former. I mean, if you look at our footprint, 80% of our sales come from markets that are outside the top 20 DMAs. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Yeah. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. And in the world of middle-market media, in general, and middle-market outdoor in particular, the sales mix in places like Baton Rouge and Tallahassee and Little Rock, and places that look and sound like that tends to be in that sort of 85%, 15% range; 15% nationally, 85% local. And consequently, we do have a much larger local sales force than our colleagues. We've got about 960 account executives that touch those local customers every day. So I would say it's mostly a function of where we are and somewhat a function of our sales tactics and very large local sales force. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. That's helpful. Thank you. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Yeah. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Maria Ripps - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning. This is Maria Ripps on for Ben. Sean, any color you could share with us on pricing versus occupancy? Yesterday, your competitor called out lower occupancy as a driver of weakness. I wonder if you could comment on what you're seeing on your side. Thank you. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Well, the first quarter went great. So being up 1.3%, you're slicing it pretty thin on what drove that. I would say, as a general comment, that today Lamar's platform is at normalized occupancy. And historically, normalized occupancy for our bulletin product, which is our largest product, is around low-80s percent occupancy on an annualized basis. And for our poster product, it's sort of low 70s annualized occupancy, and we're there. So anything we're picking up now to us feels like driving rates. And so I would say, it's coming from rate. And to the extent we're able to hit our goals for 2017, it's going to have to come from rate. Maria Ripps - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Operator At this time, I am showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Sean Riley for closing remarks. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Well, thank you all for listening in. We look forward to visiting with you in three months' time to talk about how the second quarter went. Thanks again. Operator Thank you.

So we're cautiously maintaining our guidance and we think that 2017 is still intact. Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Can I just ask one follow-up? Are you taking share in your market from any other media? Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. I believe we are. It's not big numbers, Marci. I think you can look at what's going on with other media and the numbers they're reporting. And clearly, they're losing share. Most of that is going to the Googles and Facebooks of the world. But because we're growing in the face of a shrinking ad pie for traditional media, by definition, we're taking a little bit of share. Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from David Miller of Loop Capital Markets. David W. Miller - Loop Capital Markets LLC Yeah. Hey, guys. Sean, nice to see you guys maintain your guidance. Just wanted to ask about acquisitions for a second. The balance sheet looks like it's just in absolutely perfect shape. Net debt-to-EBITDA can't really be any more perfect than it already is. It feels to me like you guys have integrated the Clear Channel acquisition from, not this past January, but the January prior, pretty well. How do you feel about tuck-in deals going forward, just given that the balance sheet looks like there's capacity to do deals? Thanks a lot. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Yeah. Thanks, David. I think, on the tuck-in acquisition front, this is going to kind of be a steady-as-she-goes here. As you know, when you take a look at our free cash flow after everything, after all CapEx, after interest, after the distribution, we have a little more than $100 million left over at the end of the day. David W. Miller - Loop Capital Markets LLC Yes. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. It feels to us like that's about what we'll deploy this year, absent something bigger coming up. Just kind of feels like a sort of steady-as-she-goes tuck-in year for 2017. David W. Miller - Loop Capital Markets LLC Okay, wonderful. Thank you very much. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Yeah. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. I just had a broader question on your national/local mix. Is that more a function of just the location of your facings? Or is it a particular way you sort of array your sales force to go after sort of easier dollars in the local market? Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Yeah. Thanks, Jason. It's the former. I mean, if you look at our footprint, 80% of our sales come from markets that are outside the top 20 DMAs. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Yeah. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. And in the world of middle-market media, in general, and middle-market outdoor in particular, the sales mix in places like Baton Rouge and Tallahassee and Little Rock, and places that look and sound like that tends to be in that sort of 85%, 15% range; 15% nationally, 85% local. And consequently, we do have a much larger local sales force than our colleagues. We've got about 960 account executives that touch those local customers every day. So I would say it's mostly a function of where we are and somewhat a function of our sales tactics and very large local sales force. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. That's helpful. Thank you. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Yeah. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Maria Ripps - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning. This is Maria Ripps on for Ben. Sean, any color you could share with us on pricing versus occupancy? Yesterday, your competitor called out lower occupancy as a driver of weakness. I wonder if you could comment on what you're seeing on your side. Thank you. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Well, the first quarter went great. So being up 1.3%, you're slicing it pretty thin on what drove that. I would say, as a general comment, that today Lamar's platform is at normalized occupancy. And historically, normalized occupancy for our bulletin product, which is our largest product, is around low-80s percent occupancy on an annualized basis. And for our poster product, it's sort of low 70s annualized occupancy, and we're there. So anything we're picking up now to us feels like driving rates. And so I would say, it's coming from rate. And to the extent we're able to hit our goals for 2017, it's going to have to come from rate. Maria Ripps - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Operator At this time, I am showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Sean Riley for closing remarks. Sean Eugene Reilly - Lamar Advertising Co. Well, thank you all for listening in. We look forward to visiting with you in three months' time to talk about how the second quarter went. Thanks again. Operator Thank you.

My name is Karen and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Kraft Heinz Company\'s First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin. Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hello everyone, and thanks for joining our business update for the first quarter of 2017. With me today are Bernardo Hees, our CEO, Paulo Basilio our CFO, and George Zoghbi, the Chief Operating Officer of our U.S. Commercial Business. During our remarks, we\'ll make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We\'ll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for, and should be read together with, GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation available on our website. Now, let\'s turn to slide 2 and I\'ll hand it over to Bernardo. Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon everyone. From an overall perspective, I will start by repeating what I said in today\'s press release. While our top line results reflect a slow start to the year, we remain on track with the key initiatives that can drive another year of sustainable organic growth for The Kraft Heinz Company. There is no doubt that the U.S. consumption was softer than expected. As you know, the shift in merchandizing windows such as Easter was expected, however other largely Canada-related factors caused our overall consumer takeaway to be weaker than anticipated. George will discuss these in more detail. In addition, results in Canada also held back organic growth in Q1. This was driven by go-to market agreements with key retailers being made much later this year than in past years. And this was largely due to our choice to not sign into significant price or reenter requests that have come about in the Canadian retail market. As a result, we lost frequency and depth of promotional activity during the quarter. We also choose to delay several innovation launches from March to April. In the end, however, we are confident that the sacrifice we made in sales will lead to a resumption of profitable growth for both Kraft Heinz and for our retail partners. Another area that makes me confident for organic growth in the year to go is the solid returns we are seeing from our Big Bets that are already in the marketplace and the fact that the rest of our 2017 pipeline is on track. I\'m not going to get into the specific initiatives that have not hit the market yet, but what we saw in Q1 was a very healthy contribution from both Year 2 Big Bets and the new-to-the-world initiatives. This included accelerated consumption in Mac & Cheese and frozen meals, from products like Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese and Devour frozen meals that you have seen in the United States. Further gains from Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise across Europe, Brazil and Australia, the growth of Planters in China, the launch of Heinz Seriously Good Sauces and No Salt, No Sugar Added Heinz Beans in the UK, just to name a few. Importantly, the investment we made are driving the solid organic growth trends we\'re now seeing in both Europe and the Rest of the World markets. In short, our strategy of prioritizing fewer, bigger, and bolder bets is paying off. Underpinning all of this, we remain on track with our cost savings initiatives and the pace of savings is coming in very much as expected so far this year. Cumulative savings from our Integration Program are approximately $1.3 billion and we continue to generate savings from ZBB and supply chain initiatives in all our zones outside of North America. Lastly, but just as important, in March, we strengthened our vision for Growing a Better World by unveiling new goals for sustainable sourcing and animal welfare. This includes a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water, and waste across our manufacturing network by 15% over the next five years. We also committed to purchase 100% palm oil and derivatives from suppliers certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. And we implemented a zero-tolerance policy among suppliers for willful acts of animal abuse or neglect. Finally, our commitment to fighting global hunger is even more aggressive and I\'m proud to say that by the year 2021, Kraft Heinz will donate one billion meals to families in need. That\'s a broad overview of where we stand after the first quarter of 2017. Overall, a soft start to the year financially, but on track for another year of profitable organic growth. So, let\'s turn to slide three to review the details of our Q1 financial results. As it relates to total company sales, there are two things to highlight. First, we had solid price realization in our Rest of the World market, particularly Latin America, to offset higher local input costs as well as in the United States. These gains were partially offset by promotional timing, primarily in Canada and Europe. Second, for the reasons I noted earlier, we saw volume/mix declines in North America. And these more than offset the solid and encouraging gains in the Rest of the World and Europe markets from condiments and sauces as well as the Big Bets highlighted. Net EBITDA, quite simple, our first quarter results were held back by a combination of the volume/mix declines in North America and the business investments to support our growth agenda in the Rest of the World markets. And these more than offset the benefit of ongoing cost savings and initiatives in North America and Europe. That said, we expect this to improve in the second half of the year. As adjusted EPS however, we continued to see strong growth mainly driven by the refinancing of the preferred stock. Going forward, we expect a combination of profitable top-line growth and EBITDA to again become the main drivers of the EPS growth for the full year. Now, I will hand it over to George and Paulo to highlight our performance in each reporting segment and what to expect in each area going forward. George? George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you, Bernardo, and good afternoon, everyone. Let\'s turn to slide four and our performance in the United States. There is no questioning the slow start to 2017 with greater than expected declines in January and February (8:40) forecast Heinz and the food industry in general. However, we saw marked improvement as the quarter progressed. And we feel good about the early read of Easter trading and the balance of the year, especially the second half. Let\'s start with the two areas that have presented headwinds to us in Q1 versus prior year. The first includes several calendar changes versus the prior year. As we highlighted on our Q4 call, we think the shift in our merchandising windows versus last year, driven by Easter timing and the impact on measured-channel consumption, as well as our market share where we typically over-index during that period. We also experienced one less day in the quarter due to comparisons with Leap Year in 2016, as well as a delay in tax returns from February last year to March this year. That impacted families that claim charge tax credit. Importantly, these families are a big, core component of the Kraft Heinz consumer base. Together, these changes in the calendar versus last year drove more than half of the 3.6% decline in measured-channel category growth and market share you can see in the chart on the right. The second factor is distribution losses of certain less profitable products in measured-channel, primarily club that affected our consumption numbers in certain cheese and meat categories. Beyond that, the combination of our non-measured channel performance and other trade-related impacts essentially offset one another. On our last call, I also mentioned that we exited the year with some of our Q4 shipments needing to be worked off in January. While this did, in fact, occur, it was partially offset by some shipments related to retailer demand for early Easter builds in certain categories, like cream cheese. Going forward, however, I do feel good about our chances of driving sequential improvement in organic growth from Q1 to Q2, and more importantly, from Q2 through the second half of the year. As a start, we\'ve already seen more favorable consumption trends in both March and April. Also, our Big Bets that are now in the market are driving consumption gains, including double-digit growth in frozen entrees after years of decline behind the successful introductions of Devour and SmartMade brands. We also had strong growth in our mac and cheese portfolio from renovation and innovation last year, as well as ongoing innovation-led growth in Lunchables. And we have more to come, including new ways to enjoy Philly with the launch of Philadelphia Cheesecake Cups, along with Bagel Chips and Cream Cheese Dips, which have had strong initial consumer response. The launch of Capri Sun Sport and Cracker Barrel Oven Baked Mac & Cheese, as well as the renovation of our Oscar Mayer hotdog line with simpler ingredients, no nitrites or nitrates, no artificial preservatives, no by-product and no change in the price. Importantly, as we begin to complete key modernization projects within our footprint activity and remove a self-imposed restriction on introducing new products in our meat business, we will start to increase both innovation and renovation activities to improve our performance in challenged categories, particularly at the back half of the year. And beginning in Q2, you are going to start to see us better leverage Kraft Heinz scale at retail. This will come in the form of increased in-store activity with several scale events in Q2, including Easter, Memorial Day and Feed Your Family, Feed The World, scale event we launched just last week as part of our fight to end the global hunger that Bernardo mentioned earlier. With that, I\'ll turn it over to Paulo. Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on slide 5 and our U.S. financials. I think George covered off the key macro drivers. In the end, we saw favorable pricing primarily in cheese that was more than offset by the volume/mix decline from consumption weakness across categories. Foodservice, cheese, meats and nuts were the categories most affected and they offset ongoing solid gains from Lunchables, frozen meals, and macaroni & cheese. Moving to EBITDA, we had incremental Integration savings, just less than $100 million. Note that in Q1, the pace of net savings versus the prior year was consistent with our expectations and we do expect that pace to pick up more in the second half of the year. In the first quarter however, the incremental savings together with pricing were more than offset by both the decline in volume/mix and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable key commodity costs in coffee and bacon. Although I would note that, versus last year, adjusted EBITDA was down only 1.4%, considering we were up against significant key commodity costs favorability in Q1 last year. Let\'s turn to slide 6 and Canada. Bernardo mentioned, Canada\'s Q1 results versus the prior year were significantly impacted by later-than-usual go-to-market agreements with key retailers. As a result (16:03) was a double-digit decline in volume/mix from a combination of reduced in-store activity and a related decline in shipments. At EBITDA, we had a slightly greater percentage decline than what we saw in organic net sales, reflecting the volume/mix decline and change to promotional levels versus the prior year. That being said, I think there are three important factors to consider as we move forward. First, we had significantly favorable pricing relative to local input costs within Q1 EBITDA last year. Second, despite the headwinds seen in this Q1, Canada\'s adjusted EBITDA growth is still in the double-digits on a two-year basis. And third, we are confident that the new go-to-market agreements we\'ve reached in Canada will lead to a resumption of run rate trends in growth and profit margins for the balance of the year. That brings us to Europe on slide 7 where we saw sequential improvement in overall organic growth, including top-line growth in the UK. Strong currency headwinds continued to be a factor in reported results and net pricing declined due to timing of promotional activity, primarily in UK and Italy. Volume/mix growth was driven by gains in UK condiments and sauces and this was partially offset by weakness in Italy infant nutrition as well as soup and beverage in Netherlands. Importantly, the ongoing stable consumption growth in the UK gives us the confidence that the business is on the right path, and that our investments with retailers in the second half of last year are now paying off. At adjusted EBITDA, we had solid constant currency gains from strong cost favorability, mainly manufacturing savings that more than offset unfavorable input costs in local currency driven by transactional currency headwinds. Going forward in Europe, while we expect further improvement to our performance in the marketplace and across geographies, we expect Q2 organic top line and EBITDA to be held back by two factors: one, is shipments phasing versus the prior year where some July shipments were pulled into June last year; the second is the likelihood of unfavorable product costs as we will continue to face transactional foreign exchange headwinds within our supply chain in the near-term. Finally, let\'s look at our Rest of the World segment on slide 8 where results were consistent with expectations we laid out on our last call. Specifically, our plan for 2017 called for us to go after growth opportunities aggressively and would include significant incremental investments in marketing, go-to-market capabilities and product development that would hold back margins. And Q1 reflected the first stage of this plan. At volume/mix, we had positive on base performance in both China and from condiments and sauces in Latin America. We also had favorable shipments related to the timing of Ramadan in Indonesia that were offset by actions we took to realign our distributor network in several countries and mainly affected our exports business. In the end, we are encouraged by seeing our investments paying off, from condiments and sauces across Latin America, and on a more local basis, a strong organic growth in China, India, Korea, and the Middle East and Africa. At EBITDA, the strong contribution from volume/mix growth was offset by two factors: one, significant commercial investments in marketing and sales to drive top-line growth in our EMEA region; and two, higher input costs in local currency, particularly affecting our business in India, Egypt and Nigeria. Looking forward, while we expect our investments to continue as a headwind to EBITDA through the second quarter, we also expect organic sales growth to accelerate from Q1 levels as the year progresses. That concludes our review of Q1 results, which brings us to our outlook for the remainder of the year. To begin, there is no doubt that the headwinds we\'ve highlighted before will remain, from highly competitive retail markets to persistent foreign exchange headwinds, especially in Europe here in Q2. But these factors are likely to affect everybody in our industry, not just Kraft Heinz. That said, we are expecting profitable organic sales growth to ramp up as the year progresses, especially in the second half. Why do we believe this? First, as George noted, we have a much stronger retail calendar in the U.S. for the balance of the year, beginning with better retail events in Q2. Second, we expect and have already being seeing our restoration of normal go-to-market activity in Canada, including our innovation and marketing agendas in light of having completed all agreements with key retailers. And third, we expect the positive investment-driven consumption trends in Europe, Latin America and Asia, Middle East and Africa to continue. At the profit line, we still expect the progression of our 2017 results to reflect aggressive up-front investment in growth and favorable commodity trends to be followed by a step-up in cost savings in the second half of the year. We are on track to deliver the $1.7 billion in cumulative Integration Program savings, net of inflation and business investments in North America by end of 2017. We do, however, have significant work ahead of us in order to deliver our plan. We must continue to execute our footprint related manufacturing line start-ups, which are well underway. We have an extensive pipeline of Big Bets innovations in whitespace in Q2 and throughout the second half of the year. And we will keep our focus on our defined strategy of investing, in innovation, marketing, and go-to-market capabilities as we ramp up the savings and efficiencies within our business. In the end, we continue to expect 2017 will be another year of sustainable profitable growth for The Kraft Heinz Company and another significant step forward in realizing our potential. Thank you. And now, we\'d be happy to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. A quick one and if you said this on the call I had a little trouble with some of the technology, I couldn\'t hear all of it so I apologize. But you talked in the past, I think, about maybe a little bit of a headwind early in the year from temporarily shifting some production as you closed some plants. I\'m just trying to get a sense if this affected your gross margin at all in the period? Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Ken. Hi, this is Paulo. So, I don\'t remember we mentioning it during the call, but in terms of the gross margin, which is pretty much flat year-over-year, it\'s kind of encouraging to us given the commodity headwind that we had this quarter comparing to the prior year\'s first quarter. And also the geographic mix that we have this year with the decline of the higher margin business in North America. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then my follow-up is more generally there\'s been a lot of media stories lately about retail price "wars" right, people talking about Walmart and Amazon going to war with each other and pricing coming down and those customers of yours I guess "asking" companies like Kraft to help along with that process. I\'m not seeing as much of that as maybe the media is making of it, but I\'m curious if you can give your perspective on really what\'s happening in the  and I\'m really talking U.S. retail environment right now. Are some of your customers, without naming any names, getting much more aggressive? Or is it more business as usual in terms of the pressures you\'re feeling in terms of pricing and so forth? George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Ken. This is George. The price competition among retailers is not like something new. And, as you know, it becomes usually a major focus every time you see a new entrant or a new format in the market, which happens that we are seeing both now. Of course, we\'d have to be mindful of the impact on us, particularly the one that we watch for the most is the equity, the impact on the equity of our brands, because we have certain expectation where we position our brands. So our approach to this will continue to be data-driven and discipline in deciding where and when to invest. So sometimes we go along and we make investments, some other times we go dark. At all times, however, we continue to be using a data-driven disciplined approach. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thanks so much. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you, Ken. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard from Bernstein. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Good evening, everyone. Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. Good evening, Alexia. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC So in the wake of the Unilever proposal from a couple of months ago, we\'ve heard concerns from some investors that your approach to reducing costs may cut into muscle and that in turn could make it harder for you to execute additional deals going forward. I guess the fear is that the board\'s a potential target. Companies wouldn\'t want their legacy to be signed to a company that could then somehow damage what they\'ve been building up over the decades. And so in this matter I think perception could be more important than reality. It\'s probably not going to be enough simply to tell us that you don\'t cut too far. So in that context, do you agree that you may have an image problem with potential acquisition targets and what can you do to overcome that? And then I have a follow-up. Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Alexia. Here\'s Bernardo. Thanks for the question. Look, I think, like you said, we need to separate what\'s perception and what are facts, right. And so if you think about our culture and what it\'s all about, it\'s actually quite simple and very consistent over decades. It\'s all about ownership, meritocracy, high performance, (28:11) brands, and dreaming big. It\'s all about those five things. And I truly believe those five things are applicable in many companies and many segments and so on. So through this culture we have, and so I don\'t think it will be more difficult or easier to do any other transaction. About the perception, and again I think you pointed well, it\'s a little different story, right, because when people think about cost cutting and so on, we\'re much more in line to get efficient to fuel and invest behind profitable growth. That\'s what we really do, right. Our selling expenditure is going up, our working dollar is going up, our go-to-market capability are going up because those are things we believe for the long run can build profitable growth like we\'re here for. So, in a sense, you may be right there is a perception problem or not. That\'s not for us to judge. What I can say that the values we have, those five things I just mentioned, we truly believe can be applicable in many companies and many segments. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you very much for that. And just as a really quick follow up. Can you quantify how much the timing shift of Easter affected your volumes this time? George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you, Alexia. This is George here. So, look, we shared that with you at the last quarter that the Easter shift for us would be about 1% to 1.5%. However, we shipped, as stated earlier, around 40% of that in this quarter. So it wouldn\'t have the big impact. If you want to get an idea where the underlying performance for the quarter would have been, so if you take out all the one-offs or the calendar effects, consumption really for our category would have been trending at minus 1.2% to minus 1.5%. So I think that\'s a good starting point for you to look at as you move forward, and then you overlay the full impact of our 2017 programs, which will be realized in the second half of the year. So you will see sequential improvement as the year progresses. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you very much. I\'ll pass it on. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. You\'re welcome. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about your negotiating kind of approach with retailers because I think you also mentioned that you lost some distribution in club stores in cheese and meat, and I wanted to know what were the circumstances for that. And tying in with what\'s happened in Canada, are you satisfied that you\'ve got what you wanted in those negotiations with Canadian retailers? Did you have to hold off in order to maintain price? And was that the main objective, which eventually you got? Thank you. Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Rob. It\'s Bernardo. In respect to Canada, I think it\'s a very fair question given our weak performance in the quarter, right. Yes, we are satisfied with the agreements we reached of which the five agreements were a top client that\'s about 80% of our sales in the beginning of March. And the fact that took us a little longer to achieve those agreements will affect. Especially the inventory and activities we had in January and February that\'s reflected in the results we are all seeing, right. Given what you\'re seeing now in April and May, we\'re already seeing the level of events and inventory coming back to normal and the planning looking at second half is a much stronger one. So we truly believe you\'re going to see sequentially better results as we move in the country. Before moving to the U.S., I think it is important to say that we didn\'t believe at that time in January when we had agreements, we\'ll work in a win-win situation with our partners, the retailers, discussions about, between consumption and shipment, the level of profitability and price points in the market. All these make us pause and say, \'hey, it\'s better to delay a little bit the agreement, but get the right spot to have a win-win situation, what we believe we have moving forward. Again, it was not without pain like we\'re seeing the results I just describe it, but we are confident that the performance will be improving from now on. George, can you say to the U.S., please? George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Sure. Sure. In the U.S. in Q1, look, we lost some distribution for certain retail items, namely when I speak about there is the cultured dairy, some cottage cheese and items and sour cream, and a little bit of natural slices that you could see in the Nielsen data. This is part of normal course of doing business. After a range review, you win some, you lose some. So for us, it\'s not a major one-off event. However, what I wanted to say, in general, our view is the following: we will not sacrifice the long term for short-term gain. That we will not do. No way we will do that. It is but against our principles. And, as I said, we are driven by consumer insight translated into data that helps satisfy consumer needs and/or retailers and the categories are better off. And that is the approach that we take as we have our discussions with our trade partners. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. Thank you. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you, Rob. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Excuse me. Good afternoon, everyone. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Bryan. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Just two questions for me. First one, I guess a more broad one. One of the questions that I think we\'ve certainly fielded more recently and even tonight is just company\'s at a point where the cost  I think the perception is the cost savings are close to fully identified and the revenues are declining and there\'s deleveraging, and it sort of underscores this notion that maybe the business  that the whole model is broken that it\'s not sustainable. So, Bernardo, can you sort of talk to that? How do you respond to that sort of theory? Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Bryan. Yes. Look, I strongly disagree with this statement. And you can see it, actually our model has been working for many, many, many years, decades and so. And if you look at the facts and data, you\'re going to see growing organic rates pretty much in line with average with our peers. But with the profitability level we have today allows us to invest strongly behind our brands and product quality. So with that in mind, our strategy really continue to be focusing on creating profitable growth within the company to really four things: first, Big Bets innovation with bolder and stronger product development; second, achieving a higher share of voice with more working media dollars behind our brands; third, investing behind our go-to-market capabilities, touching the shelves in a much more structured way; and fourth, achieving the operational efficiencies, so we can support and invest behind growth. Those are the four things we have been doing since the merger and the things we will continue to build moving forward. So I strongly disagree with this statement. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you for that. And I guess just as a follow-up, Paulo, can you remind us, in the first quarter last year, the tailwind from commodities, if I remember correctly, were like $75 million or $80 million benefit to EBITDA or EBITDA growth in the quarter, and this year I think it\'s actually a little bit of inflation. So can you just sort of remind us of what the benefit was and what the headwind is this quarter in terms of what that bridge was? Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Sure. So if you think about  just let me step back to give more color on the main impacts we had in the quarter. So pretty much our North America EBITDA declined around $40 million, $45 million. The main impact we had was driven by volume mix. And this impact offset the savings initiatives around the $100 million that we have, additional savings, and the pricing we got in the quarter. So pretty much we had the commodity headwinds we faced this quarter being really responsible of the fact that the EBITDA decline. Prior year, in the same quarter, we had a much bigger favorability than that, almost twice this size if you go back to Q1 2016. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. All right. Thank you. Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hey, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. A question on cash flow. Your cash balance ended a lot lower than we thought this quarter. Looks like a lot of working capital leakage. Is this timing oriented? What exactly drove that? Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. No. Yes. So, yes, you\'re right. I think the majority of the cash declines we had was pretty much driven by typical seasonal working capital. Q1 is a quarter that we normally lose a lot of working capital due to seasonality in that. And on top of that, we had inventory increase to prepare because we are preparing for all the footprint activities we are going to execute during the year. So the majority of this is just the timing and we expect to recover in the following quarters. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. Good to hear. And then turning attention outside of the U.S., can you give us a sense of the magnitude of reinvestment in the Rest of the World? Because, jeez, the EBITDA decline on prior-year EBITDA declines for the Rest of the World and Europe combined from a headline perspective is discouraging to see. Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. I think when I see that  just we start. We\'re still seeing that and we\'ve said that before that we would have had investments in the Rest of the World business. The growth is coming and we expect the growth even to ramp up going forward. And I think to better answer the questions, we\'re still seeing the margin there is around 20% being representative of the margin that we\'re going to see in this unit going forward. Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. And, Jason, just to add on the commercial side, like we said before, a lot of the growth are coming really from two venues, right? One is whitespace and so penetrating new categories and establish ourselves like cheese in the Middle East, cheese in Russia; Kraft sauces in Europe, Australia, New Zealand; the nuts business in China and U.K.; Mac & Cheese in Latin America and UK. So you have the core  and not only the whitespace, you have also the core that\'s pretty much the beans and soup in New Zealand and Australia, and condiments and sauces almost everywhere. It\'s still growing strongly on the Rest of the World. So we will continue to see us investing behind and supporting this growth. So, looking at that, it\'s very in line what you have been saying we will be doing for the rest of the year. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. Very good. Thank you for the answers. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel Nicolaus. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi. Good evening. I just had... Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Chris. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi. Two questions for you as well. First off would just be you\'ve outlined some areas of reinvestment for the business in 2017. I saw it noted for the Rest of the World. I just want to get a sense of how those phase through the year. And then will that spread across to the other divisions as well? Or is Rest of the World where most of that quote-unquote reinvestment is occurring? Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Yeah. So it\'s pretty much what I was saying. So we expect these investments happening in the first half of the year in Rest of the World. And we expect this pay off and start seeing better margins going back to the normal margins of the business in the second half of the year. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. That\'s the second stage in that we\'re seeing those investments. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. And then again, to be clear, mostly that\'s all in Rest of the World, right? Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Yes. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. And then just a second question for you. You\'ve talked before about your global brands and the focus on your global brands. And I know certainly you had a weaker sales performance in the U.S. so that certainly would have affected their performance. But do those global brands gain share or can you give any kind of sort of metrics around how those brands performed in the quarter? Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Chris. That\'s very much in line with what we said about the restructure plan to create the three global brands and platforms right behind Kraft, Heinz and Planters. It\'s too early stage, but I think in most part of the countries, we wanted to penetrate on 2017. We already created supply chain and that\'s exactly the whitespace I was talking about early on when you talk about we\'re starting to penetrate on cheese, we\'re starting to grow on nuts, UK, China, and now going to Continental Europe, Mac & Cheese in Brazil and UK and so on. So those brands are growing in line with our expectations for the year and it\'s starting to accelerate as much as we can. That being said, given the size of the business, and so on, the magnitude they have is still not significant, for example, to offset our performance we had in the United States and Canada. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Thank you for the time. Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. You\'re welcome. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc. Good evening. Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Good evening. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc. I guess, first one would be the bid for Unilever was interesting on many levels, but maybe no more so than it was considered sort of a growthier asset than some of the others than you\'ve done, given the emerging market exposure, the household and personal care exposure and such. So, I guess, more generally, my question really is when you think about synergies of a transaction, can they be enough almost at any level, I guess, to fully compensate maybe for a set of brands or assets that maybe might be in more of a structural decline? In other words, how do you balance those two: the synergy capture versus maybe long-term structural decline in a set of brands? Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Andrew. This is Paulo. So, to think about  the way that we think about our M&A framework, which hasn\'t changed since the beginning, and the framework is pretty much that we want to own brands that we\'d be happy owning these brands for the long run, brands with strong equity, strong relative market share, brands that can travel. But we also analyze a lot how the business operates, the go-to-market of the business, and more important than that, how the business operates better, how they would operate better, how they grow fast being together. Okay? And, of course, doing this analysis, we take everything into consideration, including all the synergies that we have, all the options that we have in terms of getting a better performance. And, again, everything that you said is always to improve our portfolio, right, when we have this type of framework. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. And more important and also very important is that we\'re always going to be very, very disciplined on price. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc. Got you. Thank you for that. And then I think you mentioned cost savings incremental of about $100 million in the quarter. Am I correct in assuming pretty much all of that is carry-over saves from last year? And I know you\'ve said truly incremental cost saves are more back-half loaded this year. So, I guess, my question is, were there any incremental cost saves this quarter and/or how do you expect the truly new incremental cost saves to ramp throughout the year? Is it primarily second half versus first half? Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Andrew. So, it\'s Paulo again. So when we\'re entering the second year of integration, it\'s much better to track for cumulative savings than trying to track a run-rate, given the structure of our savings that is net of inflation and net of investment. So we ended the prior year at $1.2 billion cumulative savings. We are ending this first quarter at $1.2 billion level and we said that and we\'re still in the path to get to $1.7 billion. So, out of the $500 million that we expect to deliver this year additional, we delivered $100 million in the first quarter. And again, we still have $400 million to deliver going forward in the next three quarters. And again, you\'re right that we said that we expect additional savings  the majority of the savings to be in the second half. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC Thanks very much. I guess, a big picture question. I know you\'ve answered a lot of questions about the model existentially. As you look back over the past six months, are there any particular costs you could identify that you\'ve reduced in the dramatic cost reductions you\'ve made that had a meaningful impact this quarter that if you had it to do over again, you wouldn\'t have done? That\'d be my first question. And, I guess, my second question would be what are you seeing in developing markets, Rest of World right now that makes you want to accelerate your investment behind those particular businesses that you mentioned earlier? Thank you. Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Jon. The answer to your first question is, quite frankly, no. The places we wanted to see increase cost that was selling and marketing, we did. Sometimes we ask ourselves on the things that have been working, and George talked about like the renovation of the Mac & Cheese, the hot dog campaign we\'re starting now in the United States, the Philadelphia Cheesecake, the Heinz Seriously Good in Europe, and the Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise in Brazil and Australia, Planters in China, Planters in Russia. If we should not have grown even more. That\'s something we ask. But that being said, there was absolutely no efficiencies or something that took over the capacities of the company to generate what, the things I said before, to focus on Big Bets, to focus on go-to market capability, to grow our share of voice behind our brands, and so on. So it\'s a no. On the second part of your question about why we believe we can accelerate the growth on the Rest of the World, because we still want to penetrate in most parts of those markets, right, we see outside of the business in countries like China, Russia, Brazil, Eastern Europe, Middle East, Indonesia, even developed countries like Japan, and so it\'s still  we can\'t be much bigger through our core categories that you already operate in whitespace, as I mentioned. So we are confident in our capacity through the global brands and the local juries (50:58) we have to generate profitable growth. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic from SIG. Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Thank you. Two questions. The first one is regarding divestitures. When I look at your cousins at Anheuser-Busch, they\'ve divested assets worth almost $30 billion from the SABMiller transaction. I realize that in their case they started with a lot more leverage, you don\'t have necessarily that pressure. But the complexity that you have inherited from all these two transactions would make you think that you would want to be more focused a little bit and exit some categories. I mean, you have this baby food business in Italy, for example, and I could mention a host of other products. So just give us a sense of what should we expect? And what is the reason why you haven\'t tried to focus your portfolio more? You would think that that would help in terms of your ability to ramp up the cost savings target. That\'s the first question. And the second one is more just going back to Unilever. The way I would like to ask the question is when you acquired Kraft Foods Group, you said that you were building a global food and beverage powerhouse. But now that apparently was going to include soap and shampoos. So do you want to update us in terms of what your vision is? I mean, should we assume that someday you could own a tobacco company, a restaurant, or something else? What can you comment on that, please? Thank you. Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. So hi, Pablo. This is Paulo. So, on the first question  and let me start from there. So, the first question was about... Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. The divestitures. Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Yes. So according to divestiture of the brands, today we feel comfortable with the brands and the capital that you operate. We think we have scale and we operate well there. Again, as soon as if we decide to divest any categories or any brand in any specific geography, we will communicate this properly to the market. So related to the Unilever potential transaction, we really believe that as I said in the M&A framework it\'s kind of  again, if you go back here in terms of only consumer brands, brands with a strong market share, brands that can travel, similar go-to-market, similar operation, I think at the end of the day that these two segments of the consumer product goods are very similar and that\'s the reason why you see also many companies operating brands for consumers, sometimes food, sometimes personal care, sometimes healthcare. Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Right. Thank you. And just if I can squeeze one follow-up. So also in this idea of complexity, at the moment, you have center of the aisle categories, you have refrigerated categories obviously with cheese and hams, you don\'t have much snacks. But can you talk about in terms of the many parts of the supermarket that you\'re in, I guess, you\'re trying to be in everything and at the same time, it\'s not just warehouse delivery, but it could DSD. Or is there a certain  or should we assume that structurally within the supermarket, you still want to be mostly center of the aisle and refrigerated is more ancillary because you inherited because of the Kraft deal? Thanks. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Pablo, this is George here. Just to confirm a few things, one, our entire model is DC. So we do not have any DSD in the United States. However, we\'ve taken a very large number of categories. Including categories in the fresh aisle, we have a business. I don\'t know if you\'re aware, but we sell in the deli specialty cheeses and under the Churny Company we have some very good business there. We sell in the dairy refrigerated aisle as well as deli both in processed meat as well as the center of store and in the snack aisle under Planters. We feel very good about our portfolio and we allocated portfolio role to each category and brand as part of our long-term strategic plan. So while we have a diversified number of categories and brands, we do not treat them all the same. We have a different role and that role would dictate the level of investment, the new product introduction, and the support that we give to these brands. And that we see as a competitive advantage to be able to utilize in the marketplace. Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Understood. That\'s very helpful. Thank you. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you. Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. If we could take one more question, that would be great. Operator Certainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thanks, everyone. If I could just squeeze in two as well. The first, some of the renovation you talked about in certain areas of the business like Oscar Mayer increasingly now seems like a necessity for bringing momentum back to those categories and responding to consumer shifts. So can you talk about the feasibility of doing that in a cost neutral way in the early stages? Or is it going to take some additional levers like managing price pack architecture or making upfront investments until you get the benefit of strong volume leverage to make that a margin neutral proposition? Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. Okay. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thanks, Matt. This is George here. It\'s a very good question. As a matter of fact, we like the renovation a lot more than innovation because the payback is a lot faster; in some areas, it\'s almost immediate. And you mentioned some of the good ones like Oscar Mayer. And Oscar Mayer, as you know, about 18 months ago, we started transforming part of the range to Oscar Mayer Natural. That\'s approaching about $100 million business now, and it will be a lot larger. We did similar things in Mac & Cheese last year when we removed artificial ingredients from Mac & Cheese, and we\'re very, very happy with the performance, we\'re growing share in the Mac & Cheese category at the back of renovation and innovation. Couple years ago, we did that on Philadelphia and you see our share and our growth there, similarly when we did that on Kraft Singles, we\'re still growing share on Kraft Singles. In all of them, we actually catered our campaign and our communication to reflect that. So while we did not change our communication strategy, we had very, very good growth rate both in term of absolute and market share and faster payback on all those things. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks, George. And then if I could ask you one follow-up as well. Just coming back to the update you provided on the U.S. You highlighted an expectation of better execution in the second quarter. Is that just sort of related function of having a fuller merchandising calendar? Or are there specific execution issues or tactical actions you wish you had sort of acted otherwise on during Q1 that you would see shifting going forward? George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Yeah Good questions, both actually. One, there is a natural shift in the merchandising calendar. One of them is Easter, and the second one, we introduced a scale program that I talked about in my remarks. So that is new or incremental to what we did in prior years. So that is as far as the promotional calendar is concerned. And the third one, we restricted ourselves from promoting Oscar Mayer and meats for quite some time and while we were going through our footprint project. That restriction has been lifted now and we are in full support of the brand. So you\'re going to see good improvement in both the cold cuts areas and other parts of the meat segment. So the combination of both is going to improve the trends that you see in the market. As a matter of fact, if you look at the very recent trend, they\'re very different from January and February  much, much improved. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Great. Thanks, again. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thanks, Matt. Operator Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Jakubik for any closing comments. Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thanks, everybody, for joining us this evening. For anybody within the analyst community has follow-up questions, I\'ll be around as well as Andy Larkin to take your questions. And for anybody in the media, Michael Mullen will be here to take your calls as well. So thanks very much for joining us and have a good evening. Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you. Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\'s conference.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Operator Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. A quick one and if you said this on the call I had a little trouble with some of the technology, I couldn\'t hear all of it so I apologize. But you talked in the past, I think, about maybe a little bit of a headwind early in the year from temporarily shifting some production as you closed some plants. I\'m just trying to get a sense if this affected your gross margin at all in the period? Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Ken. Hi, this is Paulo. So, I don\'t remember we mentioning it during the call, but in terms of the gross margin, which is pretty much flat year-over-year, it\'s kind of encouraging to us given the commodity headwind that we had this quarter comparing to the prior year\'s first quarter. And also the geographic mix that we have this year with the decline of the higher margin business in North America. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then my follow-up is more generally there\'s been a lot of media stories lately about retail price "wars" right, people talking about Walmart and Amazon going to war with each other and pricing coming down and those customers of yours I guess "asking" companies like Kraft to help along with that process. I\'m not seeing as much of that as maybe the media is making of it, but I\'m curious if you can give your perspective on really what\'s happening in the  and I\'m really talking U.S. retail environment right now. Are some of your customers, without naming any names, getting much more aggressive? Or is it more business as usual in terms of the pressures you\'re feeling in terms of pricing and so forth? George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Ken. This is George. The price competition among retailers is not like something new. And, as you know, it becomes usually a major focus every time you see a new entrant or a new format in the market, which happens that we are seeing both now. Of course, we\'d have to be mindful of the impact on us, particularly the one that we watch for the most is the equity, the impact on the equity of our brands, because we have certain expectation where we position our brands. So our approach to this will continue to be data-driven and discipline in deciding where and when to invest. So sometimes we go along and we make investments, some other times we go dark. At all times, however, we continue to be using a data-driven disciplined approach. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thanks so much. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you, Ken. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard from Bernstein. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Good evening, everyone. Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. Good evening, Alexia. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC So in the wake of the Unilever proposal from a couple of months ago, we\'ve heard concerns from some investors that your approach to reducing costs may cut into muscle and that in turn could make it harder for you to execute additional deals going forward. I guess the fear is that the board\'s a potential target. Companies wouldn\'t want their legacy to be signed to a company that could then somehow damage what they\'ve been building up over the decades. And so in this matter I think perception could be more important than reality. It\'s probably not going to be enough simply to tell us that you don\'t cut too far. So in that context, do you agree that you may have an image problem with potential acquisition targets and what can you do to overcome that? And then I have a follow-up. Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Alexia. Here\'s Bernardo. Thanks for the question. Look, I think, like you said, we need to separate what\'s perception and what are facts, right. And so if you think about our culture and what it\'s all about, it\'s actually quite simple and very consistent over decades. It\'s all about ownership, meritocracy, high performance, (28:11) brands, and dreaming big. It\'s all about those five things. And I truly believe those five things are applicable in many companies and many segments and so on. So through this culture we have, and so I don\'t think it will be more difficult or easier to do any other transaction. About the perception, and again I think you pointed well, it\'s a little different story, right, because when people think about cost cutting and so on, we\'re much more in line to get efficient to fuel and invest behind profitable growth. That\'s what we really do, right. Our selling expenditure is going up, our working dollar is going up, our go-to-market capability are going up because those are things we believe for the long run can build profitable growth like we\'re here for. So, in a sense, you may be right there is a perception problem or not. That\'s not for us to judge. What I can say that the values we have, those five things I just mentioned, we truly believe can be applicable in many companies and many segments. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you very much for that. And just as a really quick follow up. Can you quantify how much the timing shift of Easter affected your volumes this time? George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you, Alexia. This is George here. So, look, we shared that with you at the last quarter that the Easter shift for us would be about 1% to 1.5%. However, we shipped, as stated earlier, around 40% of that in this quarter. So it wouldn\'t have the big impact. If you want to get an idea where the underlying performance for the quarter would have been, so if you take out all the one-offs or the calendar effects, consumption really for our category would have been trending at minus 1.2% to minus 1.5%. So I think that\'s a good starting point for you to look at as you move forward, and then you overlay the full impact of our 2017 programs, which will be realized in the second half of the year. So you will see sequential improvement as the year progresses. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you very much. I\'ll pass it on. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. You\'re welcome. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about your negotiating kind of approach with retailers because I think you also mentioned that you lost some distribution in club stores in cheese and meat, and I wanted to know what were the circumstances for that. And tying in with what\'s happened in Canada, are you satisfied that you\'ve got what you wanted in those negotiations with Canadian retailers? Did you have to hold off in order to maintain price? And was that the main objective, which eventually you got? Thank you. Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Rob. It\'s Bernardo. In respect to Canada, I think it\'s a very fair question given our weak performance in the quarter, right. Yes, we are satisfied with the agreements we reached of which the five agreements were a top client that\'s about 80% of our sales in the beginning of March. And the fact that took us a little longer to achieve those agreements will affect. Especially the inventory and activities we had in January and February that\'s reflected in the results we are all seeing, right. Given what you\'re seeing now in April and May, we\'re already seeing the level of events and inventory coming back to normal and the planning looking at second half is a much stronger one. So we truly believe you\'re going to see sequentially better results as we move in the country. Before moving to the U.S., I think it is important to say that we didn\'t believe at that time in January when we had agreements, we\'ll work in a win-win situation with our partners, the retailers, discussions about, between consumption and shipment, the level of profitability and price points in the market. All these make us pause and say, \'hey, it\'s better to delay a little bit the agreement, but get the right spot to have a win-win situation, what we believe we have moving forward. Again, it was not without pain like we\'re seeing the results I just describe it, but we are confident that the performance will be improving from now on. George, can you say to the U.S., please? George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Sure. Sure. In the U.S. in Q1, look, we lost some distribution for certain retail items, namely when I speak about there is the cultured dairy, some cottage cheese and items and sour cream, and a little bit of natural slices that you could see in the Nielsen data. This is part of normal course of doing business. After a range review, you win some, you lose some. So for us, it\'s not a major one-off event. However, what I wanted to say, in general, our view is the following: we will not sacrifice the long term for short-term gain. That we will not do. No way we will do that. It is but against our principles. And, as I said, we are driven by consumer insight translated into data that helps satisfy consumer needs and/or retailers and the categories are better off. And that is the approach that we take as we have our discussions with our trade partners. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. Thank you. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you, Rob. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Excuse me. Good afternoon, everyone. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Bryan. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Just two questions for me. First one, I guess a more broad one. One of the questions that I think we\'ve certainly fielded more recently and even tonight is just company\'s at a point where the cost  I think the perception is the cost savings are close to fully identified and the revenues are declining and there\'s deleveraging, and it sort of underscores this notion that maybe the business  that the whole model is broken that it\'s not sustainable. So, Bernardo, can you sort of talk to that? How do you respond to that sort of theory? Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Bryan. Yes. Look, I strongly disagree with this statement. And you can see it, actually our model has been working for many, many, many years, decades and so. And if you look at the facts and data, you\'re going to see growing organic rates pretty much in line with average with our peers. But with the profitability level we have today allows us to invest strongly behind our brands and product quality. So with that in mind, our strategy really continue to be focusing on creating profitable growth within the company to really four things: first, Big Bets innovation with bolder and stronger product development; second, achieving a higher share of voice with more working media dollars behind our brands; third, investing behind our go-to-market capabilities, touching the shelves in a much more structured way; and fourth, achieving the operational efficiencies, so we can support and invest behind growth. Those are the four things we have been doing since the merger and the things we will continue to build moving forward. So I strongly disagree with this statement. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you for that. And I guess just as a follow-up, Paulo, can you remind us, in the first quarter last year, the tailwind from commodities, if I remember correctly, were like $75 million or $80 million benefit to EBITDA or EBITDA growth in the quarter, and this year I think it\'s actually a little bit of inflation. So can you just sort of remind us of what the benefit was and what the headwind is this quarter in terms of what that bridge was? Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Sure. So if you think about  just let me step back to give more color on the main impacts we had in the quarter. So pretty much our North America EBITDA declined around $40 million, $45 million. The main impact we had was driven by volume mix. And this impact offset the savings initiatives around the $100 million that we have, additional savings, and the pricing we got in the quarter. So pretty much we had the commodity headwinds we faced this quarter being really responsible of the fact that the EBITDA decline. Prior year, in the same quarter, we had a much bigger favorability than that, almost twice this size if you go back to Q1 2016. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. All right. Thank you. Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hey, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. A question on cash flow. Your cash balance ended a lot lower than we thought this quarter. Looks like a lot of working capital leakage. Is this timing oriented? What exactly drove that? Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. No. Yes. So, yes, you\'re right. I think the majority of the cash declines we had was pretty much driven by typical seasonal working capital. Q1 is a quarter that we normally lose a lot of working capital due to seasonality in that. And on top of that, we had inventory increase to prepare because we are preparing for all the footprint activities we are going to execute during the year. So the majority of this is just the timing and we expect to recover in the following quarters. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. Good to hear. And then turning attention outside of the U.S., can you give us a sense of the magnitude of reinvestment in the Rest of the World? Because, jeez, the EBITDA decline on prior-year EBITDA declines for the Rest of the World and Europe combined from a headline perspective is discouraging to see. Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. I think when I see that  just we start. We\'re still seeing that and we\'ve said that before that we would have had investments in the Rest of the World business. The growth is coming and we expect the growth even to ramp up going forward. And I think to better answer the questions, we\'re still seeing the margin there is around 20% being representative of the margin that we\'re going to see in this unit going forward. Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. And, Jason, just to add on the commercial side, like we said before, a lot of the growth are coming really from two venues, right? One is whitespace and so penetrating new categories and establish ourselves like cheese in the Middle East, cheese in Russia; Kraft sauces in Europe, Australia, New Zealand; the nuts business in China and U.K.; Mac & Cheese in Latin America and UK. So you have the core  and not only the whitespace, you have also the core that\'s pretty much the beans and soup in New Zealand and Australia, and condiments and sauces almost everywhere. It\'s still growing strongly on the Rest of the World. So we will continue to see us investing behind and supporting this growth. So, looking at that, it\'s very in line what you have been saying we will be doing for the rest of the year. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. Very good. Thank you for the answers. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel Nicolaus. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi. Good evening. I just had... Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Chris. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi. Two questions for you as well. First off would just be you\'ve outlined some areas of reinvestment for the business in 2017. I saw it noted for the Rest of the World. I just want to get a sense of how those phase through the year. And then will that spread across to the other divisions as well? Or is Rest of the World where most of that quote-unquote reinvestment is occurring? Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Yeah. So it\'s pretty much what I was saying. So we expect these investments happening in the first half of the year in Rest of the World. And we expect this pay off and start seeing better margins going back to the normal margins of the business in the second half of the year. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. That\'s the second stage in that we\'re seeing those investments. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. And then again, to be clear, mostly that\'s all in Rest of the World, right? Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Yes. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. And then just a second question for you. You\'ve talked before about your global brands and the focus on your global brands. And I know certainly you had a weaker sales performance in the U.S. so that certainly would have affected their performance. But do those global brands gain share or can you give any kind of sort of metrics around how those brands performed in the quarter? Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Chris. That\'s very much in line with what we said about the restructure plan to create the three global brands and platforms right behind Kraft, Heinz and Planters. It\'s too early stage, but I think in most part of the countries, we wanted to penetrate on 2017. We already created supply chain and that\'s exactly the whitespace I was talking about early on when you talk about we\'re starting to penetrate on cheese, we\'re starting to grow on nuts, UK, China, and now going to Continental Europe, Mac & Cheese in Brazil and UK and so on. So those brands are growing in line with our expectations for the year and it\'s starting to accelerate as much as we can. That being said, given the size of the business, and so on, the magnitude they have is still not significant, for example, to offset our performance we had in the United States and Canada. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Thank you for the time. Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. You\'re welcome. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc. Good evening. Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Good evening. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc. I guess, first one would be the bid for Unilever was interesting on many levels, but maybe no more so than it was considered sort of a growthier asset than some of the others than you\'ve done, given the emerging market exposure, the household and personal care exposure and such. So, I guess, more generally, my question really is when you think about synergies of a transaction, can they be enough almost at any level, I guess, to fully compensate maybe for a set of brands or assets that maybe might be in more of a structural decline? In other words, how do you balance those two: the synergy capture versus maybe long-term structural decline in a set of brands? Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Andrew. This is Paulo. So, to think about  the way that we think about our M&A framework, which hasn\'t changed since the beginning, and the framework is pretty much that we want to own brands that we\'d be happy owning these brands for the long run, brands with strong equity, strong relative market share, brands that can travel. But we also analyze a lot how the business operates, the go-to-market of the business, and more important than that, how the business operates better, how they would operate better, how they grow fast being together. Okay? And, of course, doing this analysis, we take everything into consideration, including all the synergies that we have, all the options that we have in terms of getting a better performance. And, again, everything that you said is always to improve our portfolio, right, when we have this type of framework. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. And more important and also very important is that we\'re always going to be very, very disciplined on price. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc. Got you. Thank you for that. And then I think you mentioned cost savings incremental of about $100 million in the quarter. Am I correct in assuming pretty much all of that is carry-over saves from last year? And I know you\'ve said truly incremental cost saves are more back-half loaded this year. So, I guess, my question is, were there any incremental cost saves this quarter and/or how do you expect the truly new incremental cost saves to ramp throughout the year? Is it primarily second half versus first half? Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Andrew. So, it\'s Paulo again. So when we\'re entering the second year of integration, it\'s much better to track for cumulative savings than trying to track a run-rate, given the structure of our savings that is net of inflation and net of investment. So we ended the prior year at $1.2 billion cumulative savings. We are ending this first quarter at $1.2 billion level and we said that and we\'re still in the path to get to $1.7 billion. So, out of the $500 million that we expect to deliver this year additional, we delivered $100 million in the first quarter. And again, we still have $400 million to deliver going forward in the next three quarters. And again, you\'re right that we said that we expect additional savings  the majority of the savings to be in the second half. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC Thanks very much. I guess, a big picture question. I know you\'ve answered a lot of questions about the model existentially. As you look back over the past six months, are there any particular costs you could identify that you\'ve reduced in the dramatic cost reductions you\'ve made that had a meaningful impact this quarter that if you had it to do over again, you wouldn\'t have done? That\'d be my first question. And, I guess, my second question would be what are you seeing in developing markets, Rest of World right now that makes you want to accelerate your investment behind those particular businesses that you mentioned earlier? Thank you. Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Hi, Jon. The answer to your first question is, quite frankly, no. The places we wanted to see increase cost that was selling and marketing, we did. Sometimes we ask ourselves on the things that have been working, and George talked about like the renovation of the Mac & Cheese, the hot dog campaign we\'re starting now in the United States, the Philadelphia Cheesecake, the Heinz Seriously Good in Europe, and the Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise in Brazil and Australia, Planters in China, Planters in Russia. If we should not have grown even more. That\'s something we ask. But that being said, there was absolutely no efficiencies or something that took over the capacities of the company to generate what, the things I said before, to focus on Big Bets, to focus on go-to market capability, to grow our share of voice behind our brands, and so on. So it\'s a no. On the second part of your question about why we believe we can accelerate the growth on the Rest of the World, because we still want to penetrate in most parts of those markets, right, we see outside of the business in countries like China, Russia, Brazil, Eastern Europe, Middle East, Indonesia, even developed countries like Japan, and so it\'s still  we can\'t be much bigger through our core categories that you already operate in whitespace, as I mentioned. So we are confident in our capacity through the global brands and the local juries (50:58) we have to generate profitable growth. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic from SIG. Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Thank you. Two questions. The first one is regarding divestitures. When I look at your cousins at Anheuser-Busch, they\'ve divested assets worth almost $30 billion from the SABMiller transaction. I realize that in their case they started with a lot more leverage, you don\'t have necessarily that pressure. But the complexity that you have inherited from all these two transactions would make you think that you would want to be more focused a little bit and exit some categories. I mean, you have this baby food business in Italy, for example, and I could mention a host of other products. So just give us a sense of what should we expect? And what is the reason why you haven\'t tried to focus your portfolio more? You would think that that would help in terms of your ability to ramp up the cost savings target. That\'s the first question. And the second one is more just going back to Unilever. The way I would like to ask the question is when you acquired Kraft Foods Group, you said that you were building a global food and beverage powerhouse. But now that apparently was going to include soap and shampoos. So do you want to update us in terms of what your vision is? I mean, should we assume that someday you could own a tobacco company, a restaurant, or something else? What can you comment on that, please? Thank you. Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. So hi, Pablo. This is Paulo. So, on the first question  and let me start from there. So, the first question was about... Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. The divestitures. Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Yes. So according to divestiture of the brands, today we feel comfortable with the brands and the capital that you operate. We think we have scale and we operate well there. Again, as soon as if we decide to divest any categories or any brand in any specific geography, we will communicate this properly to the market. So related to the Unilever potential transaction, we really believe that as I said in the M&A framework it\'s kind of  again, if you go back here in terms of only consumer brands, brands with a strong market share, brands that can travel, similar go-to-market, similar operation, I think at the end of the day that these two segments of the consumer product goods are very similar and that\'s the reason why you see also many companies operating brands for consumers, sometimes food, sometimes personal care, sometimes healthcare. Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Right. Thank you. And just if I can squeeze one follow-up. So also in this idea of complexity, at the moment, you have center of the aisle categories, you have refrigerated categories obviously with cheese and hams, you don\'t have much snacks. But can you talk about in terms of the many parts of the supermarket that you\'re in, I guess, you\'re trying to be in everything and at the same time, it\'s not just warehouse delivery, but it could DSD. Or is there a certain  or should we assume that structurally within the supermarket, you still want to be mostly center of the aisle and refrigerated is more ancillary because you inherited because of the Kraft deal? Thanks. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Pablo, this is George here. Just to confirm a few things, one, our entire model is DC. So we do not have any DSD in the United States. However, we\'ve taken a very large number of categories. Including categories in the fresh aisle, we have a business. I don\'t know if you\'re aware, but we sell in the deli specialty cheeses and under the Churny Company we have some very good business there. We sell in the dairy refrigerated aisle as well as deli both in processed meat as well as the center of store and in the snack aisle under Planters. We feel very good about our portfolio and we allocated portfolio role to each category and brand as part of our long-term strategic plan. So while we have a diversified number of categories and brands, we do not treat them all the same. We have a different role and that role would dictate the level of investment, the new product introduction, and the support that we give to these brands. And that we see as a competitive advantage to be able to utilize in the marketplace. Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Understood. That\'s very helpful. Thank you. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you. Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. If we could take one more question, that would be great. Operator Certainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thanks, everyone. If I could just squeeze in two as well. The first, some of the renovation you talked about in certain areas of the business like Oscar Mayer increasingly now seems like a necessity for bringing momentum back to those categories and responding to consumer shifts. So can you talk about the feasibility of doing that in a cost neutral way in the early stages? Or is it going to take some additional levers like managing price pack architecture or making upfront investments until you get the benefit of strong volume leverage to make that a margin neutral proposition? Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. Okay. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thanks, Matt. This is George here. It\'s a very good question. As a matter of fact, we like the renovation a lot more than innovation because the payback is a lot faster; in some areas, it\'s almost immediate. And you mentioned some of the good ones like Oscar Mayer. And Oscar Mayer, as you know, about 18 months ago, we started transforming part of the range to Oscar Mayer Natural. That\'s approaching about $100 million business now, and it will be a lot larger. We did similar things in Mac & Cheese last year when we removed artificial ingredients from Mac & Cheese, and we\'re very, very happy with the performance, we\'re growing share in the Mac & Cheese category at the back of renovation and innovation. Couple years ago, we did that on Philadelphia and you see our share and our growth there, similarly when we did that on Kraft Singles, we\'re still growing share on Kraft Singles. In all of them, we actually catered our campaign and our communication to reflect that. So while we did not change our communication strategy, we had very, very good growth rate both in term of absolute and market share and faster payback on all those things. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks, George. And then if I could ask you one follow-up as well. Just coming back to the update you provided on the U.S. You highlighted an expectation of better execution in the second quarter. Is that just sort of related function of having a fuller merchandising calendar? Or are there specific execution issues or tactical actions you wish you had sort of acted otherwise on during Q1 that you would see shifting going forward? George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Yeah Good questions, both actually. One, there is a natural shift in the merchandising calendar. One of them is Easter, and the second one, we introduced a scale program that I talked about in my remarks. So that is new or incremental to what we did in prior years. So that is as far as the promotional calendar is concerned. And the third one, we restricted ourselves from promoting Oscar Mayer and meats for quite some time and while we were going through our footprint project. That restriction has been lifted now and we are in full support of the brand. So you\'re going to see good improvement in both the cold cuts areas and other parts of the meat segment. So the combination of both is going to improve the trends that you see in the market. As a matter of fact, if you look at the very recent trend, they\'re very different from January and February  much, much improved. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Great. Thanks, again. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thanks, Matt. Operator Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Jakubik for any closing comments. Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thanks, everybody, for joining us this evening. For anybody within the analyst community has follow-up questions, I\'ll be around as well as Andy Larkin to take your questions. And for anybody in the media, Michael Mullen will be here to take your calls as well. So thanks very much for joining us and have a good evening. Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you. Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you. George Zoghbi - The Kraft Heinz Co. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\'s conference.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Fries. Mike Fries Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone to Part 1 of our Q1 Investor call for Liberty Global. The next hour or so we will be focusing on our European operations for Liberty Global Group shareholders and then as a reminder, right after this call we will be rolling into a similar call for LiLAC shareholders, which of course you are all welcome to join even if dont own shares yet. I have got a lot of folks on this call today and weve got a lot to talk about. So, I will do a quick overview of the results and Charlie Bracken will drill down into the financials briefly and then we will get right into your questions. We are both speaking from slides today. So I hope you have been access those. There is quite a bit of information that we are going to be covering, always easier if you have those in front on you. Now I am going to begin on Slide 4, with some key European highlights. There is good news in this quarter, but as you will see, we have work to do in a number of areas, which we will talk about. Ill start with a positive, which is that we continue to experience accelerated subscriber growth with a 40% increase in quarterly RGU additions in Q1 versus last year. The major driver of that growth was Virgin Media in the UK, which represented a 163,000 or two-thirds of our 244,000 new RGUs thats the best quarterly result for Virgin since we bought the business four years ago. We will talk quite a bit about the UK on this call, on both in prepared remarks and I suspect in Q&A. I will just say upfront that we remain highly confident in this market, which has delivered an average of 6% annual OCF growth, since 2013 under our management and has a great runway of opportunity. We are tackling our recent operations and commercial challenges head-on as we always do. The project lighting reboot is underway with a new team and a new reporting structure and we have already seen improvements in churn and ARPU, with new bundles and marketing plans. As you have surmised, some of those challenges contributed to financial results that did not meet our expectations and trust me, Im not happy about it and neither is anyone else from Liberty on this call. Rebased revenue and OCF growth came in at 2% and 4%, respectively, impacted by softer ARPUs and RGU growth than we had forecasted, and the mobile business across our two largest markets was negative year-over-year. That didn't help. You can see the revenue growth broken down by product in the right-hand side of the slide. Our core fixed residential business was up 2%, which was lower than expected, as subscriber growth was offset by lower ARPUs, mostly in the U.K., and B2B had a great quarter, with 9% revenue growth in the back of a robust and rapidly growing SOHO and SME sector that we support with faster and faster broadband speeds and better products and increasingly mobile. And mobile itself, across the group, was down 5%. We had a good quarter on postpaid mobile adds of 90,000, but prepaid losses, the effect of split contracts, lower usage in some markets, and importantly, regulatory headwinds conspired to drive ARPU and revenue down. Now more in the mobile business in just a second. It's still very early days in the Dutch JV with Vodafone in the face of some challenging mobile market conditions. We hit the ground running with a converged offer to existing Ziggo subs, who are also Vodafone customers, and the response so far has been very good. And then soon, we'll start marketing to Ziggo fixed line subs who use someone else's mobile product, and that's about three-quarters of the Ziggo fixed base. So we've got a deep pond to fish in when we launch a targeted quad-play product later this year. Good news is the Ziggo fixed line B2C and B2B business continued its turnaround, with 11,000 broadband net adds and stable revenue. And as the JV establishes a longer track record, you can bet we'll keep you posted on how things are going. Lastly, we're updating our guidance for the full year on this call. First of all, we're confirming P&E guidance of 29% to 31% of revenue and expect to be closer to the low end of that figure, and we're confirming our adjusted free cash flow forecast, which calls for 1.5 billion for the full year. On OCF, however, we're now targeting around 5% rebased growth for the full year, reflecting lower ARPUs and customer volumes, primarily at Virgin Media and the mobile headwinds I described. Listen, from our point of view, we are building and growing this company for the long term. So this is a bump in the road, by no means a detour or direction change, and the growth outlook continues to look very good to us. Now we just need to keep blocking and tackling, as we'll talk about on this call. And while it's not on this page, we bought $1 billion of our own stock in the first quarter, which leaves us with $2 billion available for the remainder of the year. We'll see how things unfold, but you should expect us to be aggressive buyers as and when appropriate. The next couple of slides, we'll dive into three business lines: fixed residential, B2B and mobile. Now beginning with the fixed residential business on Slide 5, and the left-hand side of the chart shows subscriber growth for Q1 in each of the last three years. And I've already hit some of these points, but the first quarter net adds were up threefold from 2015 and 40% from last year, mainly driven by the U.K., but also supported by stronger first quarters in Germany over the last two years. One additional factor has been consistent improvement in our video retention. You can see that on the slide from a loss of over 100,000 in Q1 last year to just 15,000 in this past quarter. We added 46,000 new videos subs in the U.K. in the first three months of the year, supported by new bundles, the launch of our 4K-enabled Virgin TV V6 box, and also marketing, of course, in our new build territories, but pretty much all of our markets are doing better year-over-year. And with now 40% of our video base on some version of our advanced digital platform with access to our go services and multi-device capabilities, we expect that trend to continue.  You'll see that broadband additions were up 6% at 154,000, and over half of those over were from Virgin, which had its best broadband quarter since we bought the business. Customer ARPU on the right-hand side of the page, however, is more of a mixed story. On the positive front, both Germany and Belgium delivered good growth with a 4% bump in ARPU per customer in the first quarter in each case, driven roughly 50% by price increases and 50% by net volume or bundling growth. And just so you know, we've now taken price increases in nine countries through the end of April. On the other hand, Switzerland and Austria, or as we call it, CHAT, that region saw ARPU erosion of 1% in the first quarter. I think it's important to point out that most of the price increases have not yet hit in Switzerland since over 70% of them just kicked in last month, but we did experience some pressure on top line as a result of tier mix, discounting, and to a lesser extent, VoD usage. And the game plan in Switzerland and Austria is straightforward. We're planning a refresh of our Connect & Play portfolio. We launched a new mobile product in April, with unlimited voice and increased data buckets, up to 10 gig. And we're preparing for the launch of our new sports channel, called MySports, in the third quarter, which will include exclusive content, like ice hockey, think Ziggo Sports. And we'll talk about U.K. ARPU again in a few slides. You see it here. The punchline is that while price increases and headwinds were just as we expected them to be, we pushed a bit too hard on discounts and not hard enough on tier mix, which led to ARPU growth of just 1%. More on that in a moment. Slide 6 lays out the other key growth drivers for us: B2B, mobile, and of course, Liberty GO and our OpEx efficiencies. Beginning on the left-hand side, B2B is a good news story all the way around with another strong quarter of 9% revenue growth, mainly driven by SOHO and SME, where growth is 30%-plus. All markets are performing well. And with new SOHO bundles in the U.K., Switzerland and Belgium that are promoting 300 megabit speeds, new products, and as well as mobile where we can. As I alluded to a moment ago, the mobile business itself, however, is more challenging right now. There are good explanations for the recent negative performance. In the U.K., it's largely a handset revenue issue as we grow total usage, but account separately for devices which should lessen going forward, and Charlie might explain that. And Belgium has been impacted by the new requirement to register prepaid SIMs. So while quad-play WIGO product continues to penetrate well, and postpaid growth is good, the prepaid losses were larger. In both the U.K. and Belgium, I think it's important to point out, we have not yet reaped any of the material benefits we're anticipating from network migrations. In the U.K., that means moving to a full MVNO with our new 4G pricing, and in Belgium, it means moving Telenet subs over to the base network. So there are big synergies in product innovations around the corner. The rest of our markets in mobile are chugging along actually with very substantial growth, albeit off small bases. And then lastly, we are tracking right on target with our operating efficiency plans. Indirect costs in the first quarter were flat year-over-year despite higher sales volumes, the additional costs associated with our new build activities, et cetera, and we expect this trend to continue through 2018, supported by centralized functions like T&I, and greater scale benefits in procurement and other Centers of Excellence. In my view, we have hit the mark on our indirect cost structure, and there is more to come. I'm going to finish with two slides on Virgin Media, then hand it to Charlie. Now Tom Mockridge and Balan Nair are both on the line. So in the interest of time, I'm going to hit the high points on the U.K. and then we can dig deeper on whatever you'd like to talk about during Q&A. I'm starting on Slide 7 with a Project Lightning update. I'm not going to repeat what you've already reviewed in the 8-K that we filed in late March. That 8-K was precipitated by our discovery of irregularities in the reporting of the completion status of certain premises in the fourth quarter by a small group of local managers. We're happy to dig into the why during Q&A, but most of it comes down to a few people, and a few key program elements, which faltered as the pace ramped up. It's that simple. I'd much rather focus on what we've done to reshape and restructure the project in preparation for a long-term acceleration and construction over the coming quarters. That includes, most importantly, a new leadership team and a new operating model, with oversight of the construction program, moving to Balan Nair and his central T&I network division, in addition to installing new management, adding resources and expertise from our other European operations and bringing in more consolidated and sophisticated project rigor. Balan and Tom are focused on 3 major initiatives. The first is to ensure that our 31 construction partners who are managing over 800 bill crews are better supported and have greater transparency around build schedules so they can scale up with us. This was a weakness with the prior team, and with a more collaborative approach, our suppliers tell us they are confident they can double and triple construction levels. The second priority is to better align way leaves and permits with network planning and resource allocation, so there are fewer delays. It sounds simple, yes, but it requires a much more sophisticated level of support, as you accelerate the quantity of projects and the pace of construction. And third, the group is working much more closely with local authorities, who need to be involved with us and aware of our plans and their communities much farther in advance, so we don't end up with construction delays. Now I think it's important to remember, with all that said, that a lot of things have gone very right so far. In 24 months, we've managed hundreds of bill projects in dozens of cities, and delivered nearly 670,000 new homes, 130,000 new customers and over 300,000 new RGUs. But even more importantly, the fundamental economics of the program have not changed and remain, in our view, compelling. We are still targeting 4 million premises by project completion, although to be conservative, that completion date is likely to be pushed out a bit from 2019, albeit with the benefit of extending the strong growth that results from that build. And the key drivers of our returns, this is important, mainly, bill cost, penetration rates and run rate ARPUs are on track to deliver the sort of return on investment we have been anticipating. Charlie will dig into the phasing of cash flows but this is still the best use of capital we have in front of us. Now as I mentioned, Virgin has delivered steady and consistent growth for three straight years and we're confident that the investments we're making in products, video platforms, broadband speed, and network expansion will ensure we're able to continue growing at that pace and even higher for years to come. And you can see the early impact of these investments on Slide 8, my last slide, beginning with subscriber growth on the left-hand side. Both customer and RGU growth are clearly accelerating in Virgin Media. RGU net adds in the first quarter in purple there were up 70%, with about a third of that growth coming from Lightning homes and the balance from our existing footprint. That means we are winning hearts and minds of U.K. consumers with great products, like the new V6 box, which is a much higher NPS among video subs, like new broadband bundles of 200 and 300 megabits speeds, which are 2x to 4x faster than BDSL. As you can see in the middle of the chart, however, revenue growth was mixed at Virgin. Mobile revenue was down 9%, impacted primarily by how we account for airtime in handsets, what we call our Freestyle product, which should taper off in the second half of the year. B2B was up 5%, with SOHO and SME growing leaps and bounds, while the larger wholesale enterprise business was up 1.4% and the core residential cable business grew 3%, with good volume growth, as I just discussed, but that was offset by lower ARPU. Now we break the residential ARPU down in the U.K. on the right-hand side of the slide with an illustrative bridge for the last 12 months. We start with ARPU of just under 50 pounds a year ago, the two green boxes show our price increases, big uplift, and the headwinds that we anticipated, like voice usage, and all of those were just in line with expectations, right in line. The challenge is the three red boxes, where discounts and customer tier mix over the last 12 months have negatively impacted ARPU more than we anticipated. Now both of these reflect the competitive market we operate in, for sure, and the uptick in churn we saw at the end of last year and the early part of this year as a result of things that really are inside our control, like the price increases we took in the promotions. The good news is that we've already course-corrected here, and are seeing better results. Our new bill bundle as of April reflect meaningfully lower discounts. Triple play sales in the first quarter were 63% of the total sales, versus 47% in the prior year, and then, finally, we're enhancing our customer segmentation and retention tools, more closely linking price rises to product and service enhancements. Doing the things that we know matter, the little things. But perhaps, the most significant change we've made was moving Dana Strong into the business as President and COO about 6 weeks ago, and she's now in charge of all consumer operations. Dana, as you know, is a longtime Liberty executive. I've worked with her for 20-plus years, with deep operating expertise and a strong familiarity with both the U.K. and Irish markets, given her prior roles with the company. She's a fantastic addition to Tom's team and has already made an impact. So summing it all up, we are accelerating volume growth in our fixed consumer cable business, with a renewed focus on ARPUs, retention and tier mix, principally in the U.K. and Switzerland. That's going to bear fruit throughout the rest of the year and beyond. Our B2B business is right on track with 9% to 10% top line growth. Mobile I described as being in transition, as we fight some sector headwinds that are impacting all mobile players, at least, for now. But we continue to execute synergies and prepare to launch the real quad-play benefits that we're shooting for. OpEx is stable, and providing a lift to OCF growth.  And the new build program on the continent is on track, while we quickly, and I think aggressively, retool Project Lightning in the U.K. which had already delivered, actually as of April, 700,000 new premises and will now scale up with more certainty and predictability. And then lastly, we are investing in our own story. We have 2 billion left to purchase this year. We purchased 1 billion of stock in the first quarter. You should expect us to be aggressive on that.  Charlie, over to you. Charlie Bracken Thanks Mike. So turning to Slide 10. We present the Q1 financial results for the Liberty Global Group. Now two quick reminders before I start. First of all, our results include BASE in Belgium from a year-over-year gross perspective as of February 11, 2016. And secondly, Ziggo's not at all consolidated in our financial results, effective from the beginning of 2017 as well. So for the purposes of computing rebased growth rates, we've also excluded Ziggo from our prior year results, while including the estimated prior year revenue from the framework services agreement with the Dutch JV. Kicking off with revenue in the top left chart, we reported $3.5 billion of revenue in Q1 2017, which is a 2% rebased increase over Q1 2016. Meanwhile, our rebased OCF grew 4.1% to $1.6 billion in Q1, as softer OCF growth of Virgin Media was partially offset by stronger OCF growth at Telenet. Now I'm going to provide a bit more color on our country results in a minute, but let me turn to our capital spend. This increased to 25% of revenue in Q1, totaling $884 million. In terms of breaking down our property and equipment additions, one-third of the additions in Q1 were related to CPE, which includes the incremental spend for the Connect Box, which is the next-gen TV boxes, with the balance in our other categories of new build and upgrade, capacity baseline and product enablers. For the full-year, we expect our property and equipment additions to be at the lower end of our guidance range of 29% to 31% of revenue. Moving to the bottom left. Our adjusted free cash flow was negative $333 million during Q1, and this is in line with our phasing expectations. When comparing our adjusted free cash flow from Q1 2016, keep in mind that Ziggo's positive adjusted free cash flow is included in the prior year, but obviously, excluded this year. Going forward, we expect to receive distributions from the Vodafone-Ziggo JV that we will include in our adjusted free cash flow. And with respect to our 2017 adjusted free cash flow guidance, we still expect to deliver $1.5 billion or so this year. Our European balance sheet remains solid with total third party debt and capital leases of $38 billion, of which 90% is due in 2021 or beyond, and we had cash and cash equivalents of just over $2 billion at the end of Q1. After excluding the $2.2 billion of debt, backed by shares that we hold in ITV, Sumitomo and Lionsgate, our consolidated adjusted gross and net leverage ratios were 5.3x and 5x at quarter end.  Net leverage was up sequentially from 4.8x at the end of 2016, mainly related to lower absolute OCF in Q1 versus Q4, which we annualized in our calc, and it's a phenomenon that we've experienced last year as well. For certain refinancing activities during the quarter, our average tenure remained at 7.5 years, and our blended fully-swapped borrowing cost was 4.6% at March 31, 2017. With regard to our $3 billion buyback program this year, we were very active during the first quarter, and bought back approximately $1 billion of stock, and of course, we plan on buying the remaining $2 billion by year-end. On the left-hand side of Slide 11, we present the Q1 financial performance of our European operations. Starting with the U.K. and Ireland, Virgin Media reported rebased revenue and OCF growth of only 2% and 1%, respectively. Now Mike's already covered Virgin's two-key top line issues, which were the lower customer ARPU growth, and the mobile revenue decline in the U.K. At the OCF level, 2% rebased revenue growth was partially offset by slightly higher direct expenses, but Virgin's 70% gross margin in Q1 2017 was in line with our expectations. On the indirect cost front, expenses were up year-over-year, largely due to our investments in sales and marketing, mainly related to our version TV V6, Virgin Fibre and Virgin Mobile campaigns. Now it's not on the slide, but sequentially, Virgin Media's reported OCF declined by GBP 60 million due to three factors: a 12.5 million-pound decline in seasonal revenue, including mobile handsets, TV usage and advertising; a GBP 24 million increase in marketing costs related to the phasing of our brand marketing campaigns; and thirdly, increases in staff, programming and network costs. With regard to Project Lightning, I want to expand on what Mike already mentioned in his earlier comments regarding the reboot of the program. The new build is slowing in the near term, as the new management team takes over. Despite this near-term slowdown, as we entered the year, we didn't expect Project Lightning to contribute much to Virgin Media's OCF during 2017, given the subscriber acquisition and marketing costs that we incurred in the new footprint. We expect to begin seeing a more meaningful OCF contribution from Project Lightning, starting in 2018, with increasing benefits in subsequent years. Although we are behind in our previous expectations for the pace of the build, it's important to note that we continue to believe that Lightning will deliver sustainable growth and attractive returns over the medium term. And of course, we'll provide you with an update on the project in Q2. As an aside, we are moving away from providing annual forecasts of our new build and upgrade activities for all of our markets. Now turning back to operations in Continental Europe on this left-hand side of the page, in Belgium, Telenet's revenue growth was impacted by mobile headwinds, as expected, but they delivered robust rebased OCF growth of 8%. This was partly driven by $6 million favorable adjustment to recognize expected VAT recoveries in Q1 2017. Unitymedia in Germany delivered solid 6% rebased revenue growth in the quarter, primarily higher staff-related costs and higher direct costs, largely due to increased mobile handset sales contributed modestly lower rebased OCF growth of 5%. And turning to Switzerland and Austria, where the competitive landscape has intensified, we reported a rebased revenue contraction of 1%, and have a slightly negative OCF in Q1. Now revenue was negatively impacted by adverse trends in subscriber volumes and a slight decline in ARPU per customer. But the rebased OCF result benefited from indirect cost controls and lower SG&A expense that more than offset the revenue decline. And then finally, our CEE segment started the year well, with 5% rebased revenue growth, but delivered slightly lower rebased OCF growth of 4%, mainly due to higher content costs. So turning to Slide 12 and the conclusion. To sum up, we reported very good volume growth and solid B2B results. Our indirect costs were flat as a percentage of revenue in Q1, and are expected to remain that way for the remainder of the year, which we still expect will support higher OCF growth in the second half of 2017. And while we're disappointed to have to lower our OCF guidance so early in the year, we remain convinced of a much better growth profile in the not-too-distant future. As something of a silver lining, we bought $1 billion of stock in Q1, and expect to repurchase $2 billion more before the end of the year. And with that, operator, we're ready to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Ben Swinburne Thank you, good morning guys. Mike, when you think about the new team you put in place on Lightning. What are the things that you're expecting them to be able to execute on for the remainder of this year? So give us a sense to help us track sort of their performance as you guys have reset expectations here. And maybe you could put into context also how much of the ARPU pressure and sort of tier mix, you think, was competitive versus sort of execution based on sort of what the call centers were doing or what policies they had in place, if there's any way to quantify how much you chalk up to the competitive dynamics in the U.K. versus some of the things you think you guys can do better? Mike Fries Sure. Thanks, Ben. And Balan and Tom are on, so I'll let the chime in here. On Lightning, it's all the things I described just a moment ago in my remarks, which is mostly coordinating with our build teams and our local communities, but also getting the planning, the engineering and the design and the construction to sync up appropriately. So it sounds simple. You might say, what the heck happened? And the truth is that the business was doing well, and we were building at a pretty reasonable clip. It's really when we decided or not decided, but planned to increase the pace of builds that these sorts of issues arose or that they became discovered by us, I would say. And things to look for are just the clip - the pace at which we're building. It's going to take some time for us to get all the right people, processes in line and lined up, so it's not going to be an immediate bump in the build project, but this is a massive investment and a massive construction program. So it's more important for us to retool, reboot and get it right for the next three years than to worry too much about quarterly adds. I mean, I know it's an important metric for you and for others, how many homes have you built, what's the penetration rate. Those are things we'll continue to report. I'm much more concerned and much more focused on the next three years and the next three months. And I feel really good about the change we've made. I think Balan and his team have stepped in immediately and effectively. And Tom, of course, remains in charge of all of the business as a whole. But I think it's a good partnership and one that we think will bear fruit. Balan or Tom, do you want to add to the Lightning point at all? Balan Nair I think just to build on what you said Mike, we are retooling the whole organization as well, a lot of the processes, the work flows, and we are doing, I think a really good job working with our construction partners as well and we are feeling pretty good about where its headed and it will take a little to retool the whole organization there, but we are feeling pretty good about where this is going to go. Ben Swinburne And just as a quick follow-up, are you guys changing the construction partners that you have or are you happy these are the same folks you have been working with some of the getting and one thing out of your control Mike is sort of the municipalities and how they are helping or not helping, I know that is lot of a red tape, so how are you feeling about that? Mike Fries Well, they're not out of our control. They're squarely in our control if we manage the process properly, which we were doing in the limited amount of construction that we've been conducting here in the last 24 months. But as we ramp up construction, we had to be and need to be much more proactive, much more thoughtful, much more engaged. And with those organizations and those local municipalities and that's exactly what Balan and Tom are focused on now. You guys want to add to that, please? Balan Nair We are going to be using a lot of the same construction partners. We are being a lot more clear with them on the allocation of activities to each one of them. We'll be adding maybe one or two to it. And one of our key managing directors here, Rob Evans, is working a lot closer with the local authorities as well to clean up some of the previous changes that we've had and issues. And I think our partners would say that the relationship is getting stronger, and the guidance to them around the jobs are getting a lot more clearer. Mike Fries Tom, you want to speak to the ARPU tier mix issue? Tom Mockridge Yes, Mike. Thank you. To be direct, I think we can tag it on the team as our execution wasn't good enough. I think people are aware that we took two price rises last year. We saw an opportunity late last year, particularly our competitors have done this in the past. And frankly, the second price rise is just proving a bit too aggressive that has driven churn and spin down over and above our expectation. Now of course, there's competition out there, and this market is always competitive. But I think, in this case, there were internal issues with the double price rise. At the same time, problems emerged, so those living in the U.K. might be aware on our Compass box, the historic TiVo box we've had in the marketplace that we deployed. The functionality of the box slowed up. That's now been addressed with the help of Balan and the T&I group, but that was clearly a point of friction with our customer base. And we had network congestion, as we're adding customers and adding Lightning, and we had to overcome that, and we're progressively overcoming that. So, I think there were issues within our agreement that exacerbated what was a natural market reaction. Ben Swinburne Thank you guys for your answer. Operator And we will take our next question from Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal. Jeff Wlodarczak Good morning. I was hoping you could provide additional color on your previous post 2017 EBITDA guidance and the wake of the move to 5%, do you still anticipate being able to get to the high single digits and then I have a follow-up. Mike Fries Yes, Jeff. I think in our minds, that range is achievable. What we've learned is saying it means nothing. I mean, I think, as you would know, you know us well, we have historically set aggressive internal targets. That's how we manage our business. That's how we manage each other. The difference and then, perhaps, the mistake we've made is we started talking about those targets. And in the end, we appreciate guidance is important for those who follow the stock, and it's important for a number of reasons. And as you've taken on ambitious programs, like Project Lightning and things of that nature and Liberty GO, you're inclined you want to give transparency and visibility to the things that you're doing and the things that you're trying to achieve, which we did. And I mean, the punchline is we believe that range is achievable. We prefer to perform and get there, then talk about it. Certainly, all of the things that we're doing in our minds allow us to get to that point much more effectively, much more predictably in a much more competent way. The truth is that Q1, here, which we appreciate is a welcome disclosure for those. It was a bump in the road, not a change in direction or detour. And we've discussed what the reasons are and what the issues are, and we've made appropriate changes to personnel and management, where needed, and we're off to the races. So, I think the answer is yes. We think it's achievable, but we're going to start focusing a lot less on guiding folks, and a lot more just on getting our business done, if that makes sense to you. Jeff Wlodarczak Fair enough and then if could you could provide more color on Switzerland, you know as the market is beginning more competitive, it is fully penetrated, is there any danger that markets return to the Netherlands and in your opinion is that a market you think the reason you will be able to generate EBITDA growth over the medium or long-term? Mike Fries Eric's on. I'll let him chime in. My personal view is no. It's not - it doesn't have the same characteristics of the Netherlands, and the biggest difference is the main telecom actor itself. Swisscom, I would describe as, of course, competitive, effective and aggressive, but highly rational, focused on certain market share approach, and maintaining balance in that market. So all the things that we're doing we believe will continue to have the benefits in the second half of the year, principally changing the Connect & Play portfolio, launching more aggressive mobile products. We've got a sports channel coming out.  So I think, no, it doesn't appear to us to be that kind of market, but we have a lot of work to do to keep the growth engine moving there. We had a good fourth quarter. First quarter, not as good as we'd like, but we haven't yet seen price increases kick in there. That just happened in April. We haven't launched the new portfolio yet. That's happening shortly. We haven't launched the new sports channel yet. We've just launched the mobile bundle. So it's still early days in terms of how we're responding to market pressure. It would have been more of in the receiving mode in the first quarter. Eric, do you want to add something to that? Eric Tveter No. I mean, I think, Mike, you touched on all the major points. I think the market is rational. We've seen our competitors in Q1, in particular, really go aggressive on promotions, Sunrise with free TV and Swisscom with 50% to 75% deep, deep promotions, and you've seen it in the Swisscom results. They had one of their worst quarters in history, minus 5% in sequential quarter, and I think approaching minus 3% on prior year quarter. So I think that the remaining part of the year will improve because the price increase, going effective in April, April 1. One other point, the tier mix in Q4, we saw more at the low end of the Connect & Play bundles, and we've improved the acquisition ARPU from 71 in Q4 up to 81 in Q1. And the new portfolio coming into play in May will also improve volume, we believe, as well as the ARPU through the rest of the year. Jeff Wlodarczak Thank you. Operator And well take our next question from Simon Weeden with Citi. Simon Weeden Thank you. Just on the guidance, I had a question relating to the status of your midterm OCF guidance that you gave last quarter, whether you're reiterating that or putting that on in the filing for later in the year perhaps. And on the same sort of theme, the 15-month penetration level through Lightning seems to be declining a bit, so I wondered how that makes you think about your longer-term penetration ambition toward the new build areas. Thank you. Mike Fries I just answered the guidance question, which was we believe we can achieve that range, but we're focused on execution not conversation. Do you want to, Tom, discuss the penetration ranges? Tom Mockridge Yes. Look, I think the penetration charges we've shown, we've adapted from the previous earnings releases. We are now showing our net penetrations, so I think that's better understood. I think the 15-month period you see there is a moving base as a greater number of premises built move into that 15 month or 15-month period, as we've obviously progressed for the build. And if we go to - and so that will move the base around, I think, in particular, this case, it's pulled in some homes in a relatively lesser demographic, but still good building penetration. And if we look at the quarterly penetration rates from the premises built into sales in 2015, two of those quarters were already comfortably above 30%. So, I think we see that trend line of the penetration continuing towards our target. Simon Weeden Okay, thank you. Operator And we will take the next question from Michael Bishop with Goldman Sachs. Michael Bishop Yes, thanks. Just 2 questions. Firstly, maybe stand back on Project Lightning, and think about the comments you made around the potential returns still being very attractive. I just wanted to dig a bit deeper to see whether those potential returns are now lower because of some of the issues you've had, but also the recent Ofcom decision to regulate BT's fiber. Potentially, if you take slightly longer to deliver Project Lightning, then BT might be further along with G.fast in those areas as well. And then secondly, just digging deeper onto some of the comments you made around the second quarter in the U.K. being better with the new offers. It seems like you're giving the mid-tier bundles more value with higher speeds. So I was just wondering how this is improving the mix. Thanks very much. Mike Fries On Project Lightning, when we calculate returns on an investment of this size and that requires this much capital, of course we are looking at over a period of time, and when you spend the money is when the clock starts ticking. So remember if we are not building as many homes in a quarter as somebody thought we should build, we might have originally hoped to build for us we are spending less capital. So the clock starts ticking when you spend the capital. You can imagine that we are discussing that there will be free cash flow impacts if you don't spend that much capital, positive impact. So the returns from our point of view are a function of when you spend that capital, how much in fact it costs you to achieve the construction of a certain number of premises and then there are two of penetration rates you can achieve over a reasonable period of time. As we look at the project the pace of the build does not impact the overall return because as we slow down pace if we were to do that, we spend less capital. So the returns in our minds are the same, even if you flex those returns what you can expect that we do regularly, if you reduce ARPU, if you reduce penetration rates by certain amounts, the returns are still incredibly good, and still support investment, I'm not giving you specifics, except to say that there is room in this particular project to achieve great return on capital even if you flex some of those assumptions and some of the execution we have been already achieving. In terms of the competitive environment, we don't believe that the Ofcom announcements or BT's approach to G.fast materially impact our ability to achieve the overall project objectives. Clearly, I can't predict the future, how quickly will they roll out their networks, what will happen to pricing. But based on what we understand today and based on the fact that there is flexibility in the assumption that you can make that still support investment in the project, it's not going to change our position or quite frankly, how confident we are in continuing to spend the capital. You want to hit the Q2 issue, Tom? Tom Mockridge In Q2, in terms of the offers, we're seeing continued good sales. Early days, obviously, and we are seeing a moderation in churn from what we had in Q1, and of course, the period when we had the price rise. I think we had pulled back a bit on the discounts, as we discussed earlier, so we're trying to address that issue. But broadly, we are positive about the immediate growth prospects. Operator All right. And then we will take our next question from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Vijay Jayant Thanks. So Mike, based on your comments, it looks like it's an execution blip in the U.K. But one of the questions we keep getting, given your guidance over the last couple of years and what the performance has been, is that there is a structural difference in Europe in terms of customers not really willing to pay for much faster speeds or really willing to pay up for more advanced video products. And this mix shift that we're seeing is, despite your admission that maybe an execution could be more structure-related. Can you just help us sort of differentiate between those two because you're implying that this is sort of a road bump, and then that things are going to get better, so that will be really helpful. And second, obviously, every time there's a headline about ITV, Liberty Global's name comes up as a potential buyer. Obviously, you can't talk about M&A, but just strategically owning advertising assets in the U.K. and any synergies or strategic advantage of having that, can you sort of help us think through that? Mike Fries Sure. It's a good question, and on the first one and the second one. On the execution point, I think as Tom mentioned, and as we've tried to be clear, all of the things that have occurred are explainable, and they're explainable principally by decisions or action or inaction that we have taken or teams working for us have taken. In the case of Project Lightning, we've identified those issues. We've rectified those issues. We've put new leadership and management in place that we have confidence in can turn those particular problems around, and we are now sort of at a new level of execution, and time will tell, we'll have to prove to you that that's the case. But in terms of Project Lightning, it's on us, as Tom said. And when you look at the penetration rates we're achieving, the ARPUs we're achieving, the build costs that we're achieving, this was merely a matter of blocking and tackling on the construction end of the project. And now I feel like with Balan's support and the team from Europe diving in, we've got the right sort of folks working on that. In terms of the other matters, and what Tom referenced around the hangover from Q4, the manner in which we dealt with customer churn in Q1 and the competitive factors in Q1, those are decisions we make. But we are in a competitive business, don't get me wrong. We are in a competitive business, but we rely on the teams on the ground and Tom's team and his marketing team and his customer operations team to make decisions quickly on the fly around retention, around pricing and discounts, and we've been doing this a long time, decades. So sometimes, you get it right. Sometimes, you don't get it right. And I think in the first quarter, we didn't get it right in the sense that we were probably a bit too aggressive on volume, and since then, we've learned what those particular problems were. We've rectified those as well. We put new management in. I think Dana is going to be an extremely positive influence on how we're managing end-to-end customer relationships and customer operations. Now back to your main question, is there something structural about Europe? I don't think so. I mean, remember, two or three important things. First of all, in Europe, we're starting from $30, $40, $50 ARPUs, not $150. And in our minds, this has been a major and important narrative and thesis for our business. We believe we have customer ARPU growth ahead of us, and we've shown you that. Even though we only grew 1% in the U.K., we're growing ARPUs 4% in not some of other bigger markets, and historically, in that range, 2% to 3% to 4%. So it's our view that we have incredible products to sell our consumers. We have great relationships with those consumers, and we're in the business of getting more products into the home. And so far, we've been able to do that. So, I don't believe there's something structural happening in Europe. I wouldn't say the same thing about the mobile business. I think what's happening in Europe in the mobile business is not only structural, it's global, and you're witnessing that here in the U.S. as well as. The mobile business is clearly one that can come under pressure relatively quickly, and it's not always in your control how and when those moments occur. And in the case of a couple of our markets, in particular, Holland, and even the U.K. and sometimes even Belgium, you have to react to competition, and you have to be quick and on your feet, but it's a very highly competitive market and highly competitive product. What we haven't yet seen are the real advantages that come from combining fixed and mobile. We haven't seen the real synergies that come in a place like Holland or Belgium from putting those two businesses together, and we've only just started becoming aggressive on mobile in the U.K. now that we have a new 4G deal and better pricing from BT. So we're still sort of, I would say, at the starting gate when it comes to quad-play in these markets. We've inherited some challenging mobile businesses in their own right, but we haven't yet converged them to the point where we can start showing you the benefits of quad-play. So that's why I described, the mobile business for us in slightly a transition phase. In terms of ITV, there's no change in our posture on that business. We think Adam Crozier was a great CEO. His departure, pending departure doesn't change our view one way or the other. We are not in a position at this point to say anything about ITV. It's not a transaction we're working on. I think that should be clear to you. But in the end, content is not unimportant to us. I mean, it is important to us over the time. Look at what we're doing in Switzerland with the sports channel. Look at the success of Ziggo Sport. We'll talk more about the success we're having in Belgium and Ireland with our free-to-air assets. But we're also smart, we think, managers of capital. If ITV was trading at a much lower multiple, it might be interesting. Where it's trading today and the premium required, it's not interesting. So, I think you need to, hopefully, trust us that we are going to try to make decisions in terms of capital allocation that reflect a desire to create accretive combinations, not dilutive combinations, despite what we might think as strategic opportunity here or there. So that's the position of ITV, which is really no change at all at this point. Vijay Jayant Thanks so much. Mike Fries Yes. Operator We will take our next question from Ulrich Rathe with Jefferies. Ulrich Rathe Thanks very much. And I'd like to ask Tom a question on the U.K., first of all, if that's all right. You just sort of described the first quarter as a bit of an execution blip, trying to contain the churn on the price rise. Just wondering, have you changed tactics compared to what you've used in the past in the first quarter? And is there really an alternative rollout, an alternative scenario that would have led to a much better outcome? In other words, is it really the execution of the churn mitigation in the first quarter that's the issue or is it the price rise in the fourth quarter and the way that has been executing that's at the heart of the issue? And that then leads into my sort of additional question. How much room do you really see in the U.K. to continue the price inflation? I mean there's major consumer advisor organizations out there that provide you with haggling scripts. They publish success rates for the different operators, and it just sounds as if the environment, given the price inflation over the years, has become such that it's increasingly more difficult to push these things through. So those would be my two questions, please. Thank you. Tom Mockridge Well, a couple of points there. I think the - clearly, the change was we took an early price rise, having taken two price rises in 2016. That was the big change we took. In hindsight, that's proven to be too aggressive. And as I said, we had the - in conjunction with that, service issues, which were impactful, which have been fundamentally correct, but were impactful. I think, going forward, yes, there are things to do different. We have increased the top speed for consumers here to 300 meg. We're actually selling at a minimum speed, 100 meg. We're progressively rolling out the new Liberty Global Group EOS box, which we have branded as V6, and the NPS performance of that box is just incredibly positive compared to our historic Compass box, and we are progressively improving on our TV upgrades. It's been a long project, and frankly, behind where we had hoped it to be in terms of additional VoD and additional capability. So the product continues to improve and as we pass through some of these jobs. All these things do give us a degree of confidence in terms of what we're offering the customer. I think the point you made about our customer base digitizing is completely true, and I think we had a job in front of us to make sure we keep pace with our customers.  We have investments in place now. We're rolling out a new contact center system, right across our contact centers to give our call center operators a better ability to make the best offer and making retention offers, and using the digital knowledge we have in our own business to help them make positive decisions for the business and for our customers. So, I think it's a whole range of those things, which come together. And in the medium-term, going forward, we're going to continue to offer increased value to our customers if we're going to expect to get modest, but worthwhile rental increases going forward. So we'll be focused on all of those things. Ulrich Rathe Thank you. Operator And we will take our next question from Steven Malcom with Arete Research. Steven Malcom Good morning guys. I had a couple of questions. First of all, just some Lightning-related questions, I just wanted to get your sense of what you thought current broadband penetration in the Lightning footprint is, and also what you think churn is and where you think that has to get to, to get your 40%. Because for now, the numbers, it looks to me like churn would have to double to get enough gross adds to get up to the sort of 40%. And then just a question on the central cost, I think at the Q - at the full year results, Mike, you said that the -sort of bringing in the service charges from Ziggo would depress OCF growth by a couple of hundred basis points. In Q1, it seems to add 100 basis points. Was that just phasing, and how should we think about the impact of those service charges from VodafoneZiggo to the rest of the year? Thanks a lot. Mike Fries Yes, the impact of the service charges, and I'll let Jason or Charlie chime in here, have been rebased. So what we've assumed is when you look at - when we show our growth rates year-over-year in OCF, we assume we received those service charges in the prior year as well. There might be some changes here or there in terms of how much we are, in fact, receiving, but we aren't benefiting from those service charges or those framework agreement payments. They're essentially in both quarters, this quarter and in the prior year quarter on a pro forma basis. But Tom, you want to hit the Lightning point? Tom Mockridge Yes. I think on that point, we're finding typically the penetration of broadband in the new build areas is not atypical to the rest of the U.K. So it's 80%-plus, maybe fractionally low because there's been less competitive intensity in those areas, but all those people in these Lightning areas are today serviced by BT in one form or the other, so either BT directly or by Openreach. And therefore, they're all limited to a maximum product of 76 meg. But yes, we have to turn them out from existing supply. There's no question about that, and that often they are in contract and they want their contract to come through. And they might be buying other services, particularly TV, so we got to turn out the bundle. I think we are proving we can turn them out. If you compare it with marketing again, it's - you've got to have the negotiations. You've got to offer more product. I think we are showing we can get those penetrations and offer them a better service at the same time. Steven Malcom Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator And we will take our final question today from Jonathan Dann with Royal Bank of Canada. Jonathan Dann Hi there, if I - basically on convergence that ratios are relatively low even in the UK, is the take away that you're expecting sort of the attachment great of mobile to broadband and TV to go up across the markets? Mike Fries Well, it's early days for us. Well, a lot of market - a lot of companies but certainly early days for us if you're talking about fixed mobile convergence penetration rates. I mean, we're averaging about 14% in Europe. Some markets are higher. The U.K. is about 20. Belgium is in the 30s if you include the Telenet business, as well as the BASE business. And I think Holland starts out, lies somewhere in the 20% range, 20%-plus range. So it's early days in terms of products in overlap of fixed to mobile customers. But the magic happens when in a place like Belgium, you start to converge, not just the customer accounts, but the actual products and services you sell.  We haven't really done that anywhere else yet. I mean, in Holland, we simply are offering three or four different benefits to overlapping customers to keep them happy and sticky. We haven't yet launched a true quad-play product where data bundles and unlimited voice bundles and services are truly converged. We have done that in Belgium with WIGO, and we've got - going on 200,000 subs there, almost 190,000 subs, I think. And that has become a very sticky, very attractive product, where - it's where we all need to head in terms of making this particular investment in mobile payoff. The payoff, of course, is reduced churn in the fixed business. The payoff is additional margin, and the payoff is having your finger on that connectivity pulse, so that you're always able to understand where your customers are, what their needs are, what their data consumption is, and you can monetize that across multiple platforms. That's where we're going, but we are - it is a little bit of a wake-up call in mobile business, as you all know, because I'm guessing most of you are investors in the mobile business. It's not an easy business. There's a reason why we haven't bought mobile assets everywhere in Europe because I think that, that business is still in transition, and the mobile sector itself is still in transition, and we'll pick our spot. In the meantime, our MVNO deals give us the ability to compete, create stickiness and churn reduction without, in most cases, a massive investment. So, we're all in it, but we're also, as we've told you all along, very opportunistic and taking a one-size-does-not-fit-all approach to mobility in Europe. Does that answer your question? Jonathan Dann It does, yes. Mike Fries Okay, great. Mike Fries All right. Well, thanks, everybody. Appreciate you being on the call today and hearing us out. Clearly, as I said earlier, and I think as Tom mentioned too, the ball is in our court here. We take it on the chin, and it wasn't the best quarter. But having delivered, I don't know, 46 straight quarters of growth, we know we're not going to be perfect in every particular operating period, but I have confidence in the team. On this call, I also, especially given the changes we've made to management in some of the core areas in the U.K. and so leave it to us. We're focused on growth. We're incented around growth, and we have high optimism and confidence so that we can achieve that growth, and we look forward to showing you that through the rest of the year. Thanks for being on the call. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Liberty Global's first quarter 2017 investor call for its European operations.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Ben Swinburne Thank you, good morning guys. Mike, when you think about the new team you put in place on Lightning. What are the things that you're expecting them to be able to execute on for the remainder of this year? So give us a sense to help us track sort of their performance as you guys have reset expectations here. And maybe you could put into context also how much of the ARPU pressure and sort of tier mix, you think, was competitive versus sort of execution based on sort of what the call centers were doing or what policies they had in place, if there's any way to quantify how much you chalk up to the competitive dynamics in the U.K. versus some of the things you think you guys can do better? Mike Fries Sure. Thanks, Ben. And Balan and Tom are on, so I'll let the chime in here. On Lightning, it's all the things I described just a moment ago in my remarks, which is mostly coordinating with our build teams and our local communities, but also getting the planning, the engineering and the design and the construction to sync up appropriately. So it sounds simple. You might say, what the heck happened? And the truth is that the business was doing well, and we were building at a pretty reasonable clip. It's really when we decided or not decided, but planned to increase the pace of builds that these sorts of issues arose or that they became discovered by us, I would say. And things to look for are just the clip - the pace at which we're building. It's going to take some time for us to get all the right people, processes in line and lined up, so it's not going to be an immediate bump in the build project, but this is a massive investment and a massive construction program. So it's more important for us to retool, reboot and get it right for the next three years than to worry too much about quarterly adds. I mean, I know it's an important metric for you and for others, how many homes have you built, what's the penetration rate. Those are things we'll continue to report. I'm much more concerned and much more focused on the next three years and the next three months. And I feel really good about the change we've made. I think Balan and his team have stepped in immediately and effectively. And Tom, of course, remains in charge of all of the business as a whole. But I think it's a good partnership and one that we think will bear fruit. Balan or Tom, do you want to add to the Lightning point at all? Balan Nair I think just to build on what you said Mike, we are retooling the whole organization as well, a lot of the processes, the work flows, and we are doing, I think a really good job working with our construction partners as well and we are feeling pretty good about where its headed and it will take a little to retool the whole organization there, but we are feeling pretty good about where this is going to go. Ben Swinburne And just as a quick follow-up, are you guys changing the construction partners that you have or are you happy these are the same folks you have been working with some of the getting and one thing out of your control Mike is sort of the municipalities and how they are helping or not helping, I know that is lot of a red tape, so how are you feeling about that? Mike Fries Well, they're not out of our control. They're squarely in our control if we manage the process properly, which we were doing in the limited amount of construction that we've been conducting here in the last 24 months. But as we ramp up construction, we had to be and need to be much more proactive, much more thoughtful, much more engaged. And with those organizations and those local municipalities and that's exactly what Balan and Tom are focused on now. You guys want to add to that, please? Balan Nair We are going to be using a lot of the same construction partners. We are being a lot more clear with them on the allocation of activities to each one of them. We'll be adding maybe one or two to it. And one of our key managing directors here, Rob Evans, is working a lot closer with the local authorities as well to clean up some of the previous changes that we've had and issues. And I think our partners would say that the relationship is getting stronger, and the guidance to them around the jobs are getting a lot more clearer. Mike Fries Tom, you want to speak to the ARPU tier mix issue? Tom Mockridge Yes, Mike. Thank you. To be direct, I think we can tag it on the team as our execution wasn't good enough. I think people are aware that we took two price rises last year. We saw an opportunity late last year, particularly our competitors have done this in the past. And frankly, the second price rise is just proving a bit too aggressive that has driven churn and spin down over and above our expectation. Now of course, there's competition out there, and this market is always competitive. But I think, in this case, there were internal issues with the double price rise. At the same time, problems emerged, so those living in the U.K. might be aware on our Compass box, the historic TiVo box we've had in the marketplace that we deployed. The functionality of the box slowed up. That's now been addressed with the help of Balan and the T&I group, but that was clearly a point of friction with our customer base. And we had network congestion, as we're adding customers and adding Lightning, and we had to overcome that, and we're progressively overcoming that. So, I think there were issues within our agreement that exacerbated what was a natural market reaction. Ben Swinburne Thank you guys for your answer. Operator And we will take our next question from Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal. Jeff Wlodarczak Good morning. I was hoping you could provide additional color on your previous post 2017 EBITDA guidance and the wake of the move to 5%, do you still anticipate being able to get to the high single digits and then I have a follow-up. Mike Fries Yes, Jeff. I think in our minds, that range is achievable. What we've learned is saying it means nothing. I mean, I think, as you would know, you know us well, we have historically set aggressive internal targets. That's how we manage our business. That's how we manage each other. The difference and then, perhaps, the mistake we've made is we started talking about those targets. And in the end, we appreciate guidance is important for those who follow the stock, and it's important for a number of reasons. And as you've taken on ambitious programs, like Project Lightning and things of that nature and Liberty GO, you're inclined you want to give transparency and visibility to the things that you're doing and the things that you're trying to achieve, which we did. And I mean, the punchline is we believe that range is achievable. We prefer to perform and get there, then talk about it. Certainly, all of the things that we're doing in our minds allow us to get to that point much more effectively, much more predictably in a much more competent way. The truth is that Q1, here, which we appreciate is a welcome disclosure for those. It was a bump in the road, not a change in direction or detour. And we've discussed what the reasons are and what the issues are, and we've made appropriate changes to personnel and management, where needed, and we're off to the races. So, I think the answer is yes. We think it's achievable, but we're going to start focusing a lot less on guiding folks, and a lot more just on getting our business done, if that makes sense to you. Jeff Wlodarczak Fair enough and then if could you could provide more color on Switzerland, you know as the market is beginning more competitive, it is fully penetrated, is there any danger that markets return to the Netherlands and in your opinion is that a market you think the reason you will be able to generate EBITDA growth over the medium or long-term? Mike Fries Eric's on. I'll let him chime in. My personal view is no. It's not - it doesn't have the same characteristics of the Netherlands, and the biggest difference is the main telecom actor itself. Swisscom, I would describe as, of course, competitive, effective and aggressive, but highly rational, focused on certain market share approach, and maintaining balance in that market. So all the things that we're doing we believe will continue to have the benefits in the second half of the year, principally changing the Connect & Play portfolio, launching more aggressive mobile products. We've got a sports channel coming out.  So I think, no, it doesn't appear to us to be that kind of market, but we have a lot of work to do to keep the growth engine moving there. We had a good fourth quarter. First quarter, not as good as we'd like, but we haven't yet seen price increases kick in there. That just happened in April. We haven't launched the new portfolio yet. That's happening shortly. We haven't launched the new sports channel yet. We've just launched the mobile bundle. So it's still early days in terms of how we're responding to market pressure. It would have been more of in the receiving mode in the first quarter. Eric, do you want to add something to that? Eric Tveter No. I mean, I think, Mike, you touched on all the major points. I think the market is rational. We've seen our competitors in Q1, in particular, really go aggressive on promotions, Sunrise with free TV and Swisscom with 50% to 75% deep, deep promotions, and you've seen it in the Swisscom results. They had one of their worst quarters in history, minus 5% in sequential quarter, and I think approaching minus 3% on prior year quarter. So I think that the remaining part of the year will improve because the price increase, going effective in April, April 1. One other point, the tier mix in Q4, we saw more at the low end of the Connect & Play bundles, and we've improved the acquisition ARPU from 71 in Q4 up to 81 in Q1. And the new portfolio coming into play in May will also improve volume, we believe, as well as the ARPU through the rest of the year. Jeff Wlodarczak Thank you. Operator And well take our next question from Simon Weeden with Citi. Simon Weeden Thank you. Just on the guidance, I had a question relating to the status of your midterm OCF guidance that you gave last quarter, whether you're reiterating that or putting that on in the filing for later in the year perhaps. And on the same sort of theme, the 15-month penetration level through Lightning seems to be declining a bit, so I wondered how that makes you think about your longer-term penetration ambition toward the new build areas. Thank you. Mike Fries I just answered the guidance question, which was we believe we can achieve that range, but we're focused on execution not conversation. Do you want to, Tom, discuss the penetration ranges? Tom Mockridge Yes. Look, I think the penetration charges we've shown, we've adapted from the previous earnings releases. We are now showing our net penetrations, so I think that's better understood. I think the 15-month period you see there is a moving base as a greater number of premises built move into that 15 month or 15-month period, as we've obviously progressed for the build. And if we go to - and so that will move the base around, I think, in particular, this case, it's pulled in some homes in a relatively lesser demographic, but still good building penetration. And if we look at the quarterly penetration rates from the premises built into sales in 2015, two of those quarters were already comfortably above 30%. So, I think we see that trend line of the penetration continuing towards our target. Simon Weeden Okay, thank you. Operator And we will take the next question from Michael Bishop with Goldman Sachs. Michael Bishop Yes, thanks. Just 2 questions. Firstly, maybe stand back on Project Lightning, and think about the comments you made around the potential returns still being very attractive. I just wanted to dig a bit deeper to see whether those potential returns are now lower because of some of the issues you've had, but also the recent Ofcom decision to regulate BT's fiber. Potentially, if you take slightly longer to deliver Project Lightning, then BT might be further along with G.fast in those areas as well. And then secondly, just digging deeper onto some of the comments you made around the second quarter in the U.K. being better with the new offers. It seems like you're giving the mid-tier bundles more value with higher speeds. So I was just wondering how this is improving the mix. Thanks very much. Mike Fries On Project Lightning, when we calculate returns on an investment of this size and that requires this much capital, of course we are looking at over a period of time, and when you spend the money is when the clock starts ticking. So remember if we are not building as many homes in a quarter as somebody thought we should build, we might have originally hoped to build for us we are spending less capital. So the clock starts ticking when you spend the capital. You can imagine that we are discussing that there will be free cash flow impacts if you don't spend that much capital, positive impact. So the returns from our point of view are a function of when you spend that capital, how much in fact it costs you to achieve the construction of a certain number of premises and then there are two of penetration rates you can achieve over a reasonable period of time. As we look at the project the pace of the build does not impact the overall return because as we slow down pace if we were to do that, we spend less capital. So the returns in our minds are the same, even if you flex those returns what you can expect that we do regularly, if you reduce ARPU, if you reduce penetration rates by certain amounts, the returns are still incredibly good, and still support investment, I'm not giving you specifics, except to say that there is room in this particular project to achieve great return on capital even if you flex some of those assumptions and some of the execution we have been already achieving. In terms of the competitive environment, we don't believe that the Ofcom announcements or BT's approach to G.fast materially impact our ability to achieve the overall project objectives. Clearly, I can't predict the future, how quickly will they roll out their networks, what will happen to pricing. But based on what we understand today and based on the fact that there is flexibility in the assumption that you can make that still support investment in the project, it's not going to change our position or quite frankly, how confident we are in continuing to spend the capital. You want to hit the Q2 issue, Tom? Tom Mockridge In Q2, in terms of the offers, we're seeing continued good sales. Early days, obviously, and we are seeing a moderation in churn from what we had in Q1, and of course, the period when we had the price rise. I think we had pulled back a bit on the discounts, as we discussed earlier, so we're trying to address that issue. But broadly, we are positive about the immediate growth prospects. Operator All right. And then we will take our next question from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Vijay Jayant Thanks. So Mike, based on your comments, it looks like it's an execution blip in the U.K. But one of the questions we keep getting, given your guidance over the last couple of years and what the performance has been, is that there is a structural difference in Europe in terms of customers not really willing to pay for much faster speeds or really willing to pay up for more advanced video products. And this mix shift that we're seeing is, despite your admission that maybe an execution could be more structure-related. Can you just help us sort of differentiate between those two because you're implying that this is sort of a road bump, and then that things are going to get better, so that will be really helpful. And second, obviously, every time there's a headline about ITV, Liberty Global's name comes up as a potential buyer. Obviously, you can't talk about M&A, but just strategically owning advertising assets in the U.K. and any synergies or strategic advantage of having that, can you sort of help us think through that? Mike Fries Sure. It's a good question, and on the first one and the second one. On the execution point, I think as Tom mentioned, and as we've tried to be clear, all of the things that have occurred are explainable, and they're explainable principally by decisions or action or inaction that we have taken or teams working for us have taken. In the case of Project Lightning, we've identified those issues. We've rectified those issues. We've put new leadership and management in place that we have confidence in can turn those particular problems around, and we are now sort of at a new level of execution, and time will tell, we'll have to prove to you that that's the case. But in terms of Project Lightning, it's on us, as Tom said. And when you look at the penetration rates we're achieving, the ARPUs we're achieving, the build costs that we're achieving, this was merely a matter of blocking and tackling on the construction end of the project. And now I feel like with Balan's support and the team from Europe diving in, we've got the right sort of folks working on that. In terms of the other matters, and what Tom referenced around the hangover from Q4, the manner in which we dealt with customer churn in Q1 and the competitive factors in Q1, those are decisions we make. But we are in a competitive business, don't get me wrong. We are in a competitive business, but we rely on the teams on the ground and Tom's team and his marketing team and his customer operations team to make decisions quickly on the fly around retention, around pricing and discounts, and we've been doing this a long time, decades. So sometimes, you get it right. Sometimes, you don't get it right. And I think in the first quarter, we didn't get it right in the sense that we were probably a bit too aggressive on volume, and since then, we've learned what those particular problems were. We've rectified those as well. We put new management in. I think Dana is going to be an extremely positive influence on how we're managing end-to-end customer relationships and customer operations. Now back to your main question, is there something structural about Europe? I don't think so. I mean, remember, two or three important things. First of all, in Europe, we're starting from $30, $40, $50 ARPUs, not $150. And in our minds, this has been a major and important narrative and thesis for our business. We believe we have customer ARPU growth ahead of us, and we've shown you that. Even though we only grew 1% in the U.K., we're growing ARPUs 4% in not some of other bigger markets, and historically, in that range, 2% to 3% to 4%. So it's our view that we have incredible products to sell our consumers. We have great relationships with those consumers, and we're in the business of getting more products into the home. And so far, we've been able to do that. So, I don't believe there's something structural happening in Europe. I wouldn't say the same thing about the mobile business. I think what's happening in Europe in the mobile business is not only structural, it's global, and you're witnessing that here in the U.S. as well as. The mobile business is clearly one that can come under pressure relatively quickly, and it's not always in your control how and when those moments occur. And in the case of a couple of our markets, in particular, Holland, and even the U.K. and sometimes even Belgium, you have to react to competition, and you have to be quick and on your feet, but it's a very highly competitive market and highly competitive product. What we haven't yet seen are the real advantages that come from combining fixed and mobile. We haven't seen the real synergies that come in a place like Holland or Belgium from putting those two businesses together, and we've only just started becoming aggressive on mobile in the U.K. now that we have a new 4G deal and better pricing from BT. So we're still sort of, I would say, at the starting gate when it comes to quad-play in these markets. We've inherited some challenging mobile businesses in their own right, but we haven't yet converged them to the point where we can start showing you the benefits of quad-play. So that's why I described, the mobile business for us in slightly a transition phase. In terms of ITV, there's no change in our posture on that business. We think Adam Crozier was a great CEO. His departure, pending departure doesn't change our view one way or the other. We are not in a position at this point to say anything about ITV. It's not a transaction we're working on. I think that should be clear to you. But in the end, content is not unimportant to us. I mean, it is important to us over the time. Look at what we're doing in Switzerland with the sports channel. Look at the success of Ziggo Sport. We'll talk more about the success we're having in Belgium and Ireland with our free-to-air assets. But we're also smart, we think, managers of capital. If ITV was trading at a much lower multiple, it might be interesting. Where it's trading today and the premium required, it's not interesting. So, I think you need to, hopefully, trust us that we are going to try to make decisions in terms of capital allocation that reflect a desire to create accretive combinations, not dilutive combinations, despite what we might think as strategic opportunity here or there. So that's the position of ITV, which is really no change at all at this point. Vijay Jayant Thanks so much. Mike Fries Yes. Operator We will take our next question from Ulrich Rathe with Jefferies. Ulrich Rathe Thanks very much. And I'd like to ask Tom a question on the U.K., first of all, if that's all right. You just sort of described the first quarter as a bit of an execution blip, trying to contain the churn on the price rise. Just wondering, have you changed tactics compared to what you've used in the past in the first quarter? And is there really an alternative rollout, an alternative scenario that would have led to a much better outcome? In other words, is it really the execution of the churn mitigation in the first quarter that's the issue or is it the price rise in the fourth quarter and the way that has been executing that's at the heart of the issue? And that then leads into my sort of additional question. How much room do you really see in the U.K. to continue the price inflation? I mean there's major consumer advisor organizations out there that provide you with haggling scripts. They publish success rates for the different operators, and it just sounds as if the environment, given the price inflation over the years, has become such that it's increasingly more difficult to push these things through. So those would be my two questions, please. Thank you. Tom Mockridge Well, a couple of points there. I think the - clearly, the change was we took an early price rise, having taken two price rises in 2016. That was the big change we took. In hindsight, that's proven to be too aggressive. And as I said, we had the - in conjunction with that, service issues, which were impactful, which have been fundamentally correct, but were impactful. I think, going forward, yes, there are things to do different. We have increased the top speed for consumers here to 300 meg. We're actually selling at a minimum speed, 100 meg. We're progressively rolling out the new Liberty Global Group EOS box, which we have branded as V6, and the NPS performance of that box is just incredibly positive compared to our historic Compass box, and we are progressively improving on our TV upgrades. It's been a long project, and frankly, behind where we had hoped it to be in terms of additional VoD and additional capability. So the product continues to improve and as we pass through some of these jobs. All these things do give us a degree of confidence in terms of what we're offering the customer. I think the point you made about our customer base digitizing is completely true, and I think we had a job in front of us to make sure we keep pace with our customers.  We have investments in place now. We're rolling out a new contact center system, right across our contact centers to give our call center operators a better ability to make the best offer and making retention offers, and using the digital knowledge we have in our own business to help them make positive decisions for the business and for our customers. So, I think it's a whole range of those things, which come together. And in the medium-term, going forward, we're going to continue to offer increased value to our customers if we're going to expect to get modest, but worthwhile rental increases going forward. So we'll be focused on all of those things. Ulrich Rathe Thank you. Operator And we will take our next question from Steven Malcom with Arete Research. Steven Malcom Good morning guys. I had a couple of questions. First of all, just some Lightning-related questions, I just wanted to get your sense of what you thought current broadband penetration in the Lightning footprint is, and also what you think churn is and where you think that has to get to, to get your 40%. Because for now, the numbers, it looks to me like churn would have to double to get enough gross adds to get up to the sort of 40%. And then just a question on the central cost, I think at the Q - at the full year results, Mike, you said that the -sort of bringing in the service charges from Ziggo would depress OCF growth by a couple of hundred basis points. In Q1, it seems to add 100 basis points. Was that just phasing, and how should we think about the impact of those service charges from VodafoneZiggo to the rest of the year? Thanks a lot. Mike Fries Yes, the impact of the service charges, and I'll let Jason or Charlie chime in here, have been rebased. So what we've assumed is when you look at - when we show our growth rates year-over-year in OCF, we assume we received those service charges in the prior year as well. There might be some changes here or there in terms of how much we are, in fact, receiving, but we aren't benefiting from those service charges or those framework agreement payments. They're essentially in both quarters, this quarter and in the prior year quarter on a pro forma basis. But Tom, you want to hit the Lightning point? Tom Mockridge Yes. I think on that point, we're finding typically the penetration of broadband in the new build areas is not atypical to the rest of the U.K. So it's 80%-plus, maybe fractionally low because there's been less competitive intensity in those areas, but all those people in these Lightning areas are today serviced by BT in one form or the other, so either BT directly or by Openreach. And therefore, they're all limited to a maximum product of 76 meg. But yes, we have to turn them out from existing supply. There's no question about that, and that often they are in contract and they want their contract to come through. And they might be buying other services, particularly TV, so we got to turn out the bundle. I think we are proving we can turn them out. If you compare it with marketing again, it's - you've got to have the negotiations. You've got to offer more product. I think we are showing we can get those penetrations and offer them a better service at the same time. Steven Malcom Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator And we will take our final question today from Jonathan Dann with Royal Bank of Canada. Jonathan Dann Hi there, if I - basically on convergence that ratios are relatively low even in the UK, is the take away that you're expecting sort of the attachment great of mobile to broadband and TV to go up across the markets? Mike Fries Well, it's early days for us. Well, a lot of market - a lot of companies but certainly early days for us if you're talking about fixed mobile convergence penetration rates. I mean, we're averaging about 14% in Europe. Some markets are higher. The U.K. is about 20. Belgium is in the 30s if you include the Telenet business, as well as the BASE business. And I think Holland starts out, lies somewhere in the 20% range, 20%-plus range. So it's early days in terms of products in overlap of fixed to mobile customers. But the magic happens when in a place like Belgium, you start to converge, not just the customer accounts, but the actual products and services you sell.  We haven't really done that anywhere else yet. I mean, in Holland, we simply are offering three or four different benefits to overlapping customers to keep them happy and sticky. We haven't yet launched a true quad-play product where data bundles and unlimited voice bundles and services are truly converged. We have done that in Belgium with WIGO, and we've got - going on 200,000 subs there, almost 190,000 subs, I think. And that has become a very sticky, very attractive product, where - it's where we all need to head in terms of making this particular investment in mobile payoff. The payoff, of course, is reduced churn in the fixed business. The payoff is additional margin, and the payoff is having your finger on that connectivity pulse, so that you're always able to understand where your customers are, what their needs are, what their data consumption is, and you can monetize that across multiple platforms. That's where we're going, but we are - it is a little bit of a wake-up call in mobile business, as you all know, because I'm guessing most of you are investors in the mobile business. It's not an easy business. There's a reason why we haven't bought mobile assets everywhere in Europe because I think that, that business is still in transition, and the mobile sector itself is still in transition, and we'll pick our spot. In the meantime, our MVNO deals give us the ability to compete, create stickiness and churn reduction without, in most cases, a massive investment. So, we're all in it, but we're also, as we've told you all along, very opportunistic and taking a one-size-does-not-fit-all approach to mobility in Europe. Does that answer your question? Jonathan Dann It does, yes. Mike Fries Okay, great. Mike Fries All right. Well, thanks, everybody. Appreciate you being on the call today and hearing us out. Clearly, as I said earlier, and I think as Tom mentioned too, the ball is in our court here. We take it on the chin, and it wasn't the best quarter. But having delivered, I don't know, 46 straight quarters of growth, we know we're not going to be perfect in every particular operating period, but I have confidence in the team. On this call, I also, especially given the changes we've made to management in some of the core areas in the U.K. and so leave it to us. We're focused on growth. We're incented around growth, and we have high optimism and confidence so that we can achieve that growth, and we look forward to showing you that through the rest of the year. Thanks for being on the call. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Liberty Global's first quarter 2017 investor call for its European operations.

Todays conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Don Zerio, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Don Zerio Good morning. Welcome to the Linear Technology conference call. I am joined today by Bob Swanson, our Executive Chairman and Lothar Maier, our CEO. I would like to remind you that in our presentation today and our answer to certain questions that may follow, we may make forward-looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, our financial results for future periods; our ability to produce and sell existing products; the timing and introduction of new products and processes; and general conditions in the world economy and financial markets. In addition to these risks, please refer to the risk factors listed in the companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2015 and our subsequent quarterly filings on Form 10-Q. Also SEC Regulation FD regarding selective disclosure influences our interaction with investors. Accordingly, this conference call will be our forum to respond to questions regarding our estimated financial performance going forward. Should you have questions regarding our estimates of sales and profits or other financial matters for the upcoming quarter, this is the time we are free to respond to your questions. As noted in our press release which was released yesterday just after the market closed, revenue for the March quarter came in at the higher end of our guidance at $361.1 million, up 4% from the December quarter. Gross margin increased to 76.2% from 75.7% benefiting from the higher sales base of full quarter production in our fabs and certain other manufacturing efficiencies. Recall that our second quarter had less production days in our fabs due to holidays and plant shutdown days. Operating margin improved to 45% of sales, up from 43.1% due to the higher gross margin and one less week of operating expenses as we had 14 weeks in our second quarter. Our effective tax rate was slightly higher in the third quarter at 21.75% versus 19.5% in Q2 on lower discrete quarterly items. Net income and earnings per share were $128.4 million and $0.52 per share. All told, this was a pretty good quarter and we are happy with the results given global macroeconomic conditions that are still providing some headwinds. We beat the midpoint of our guidance, we increased gross margin and operating margin and our bookings increased over the prior quarter at a level that should allow us to grow in the fourth quarter as well. The transportation market continues to grow nicely and we are seeing recovery in the industrial market and to a lesser extent, the communications market, which has been weak for some time. We are seeing recovery across the broad-based including the distribution and the smaller and midsized customers. In general, inventories in the channel appear to be imbalanced and we believe we are shipping to end customer demand. However, there remains pockets of weaknesses in certain geographies and the computer market remains particularly weak though that is not a major market for us. We remain cautious given the general business climate, but based upon our third quarter bookings and our current run rate we are currently projecting revenue to be up 2% to 5% in the June quarter. Turning to bookings by region and market sector, as a reminder, we have posted bookings by market and revenue by geography for the quarter on our website at linear.com under Investor Relations Supplemental Information. We post this information by the end of our business day on the day we released our results. Total bookings increased for the quarter and we had a positive book-to-bill ratio. Bookings increased to both North America and the international market. Within international, bookings were up in each of our major geographic regions, Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific. We continue to do particularly well in China as bookings were up the most in that region on the strength of automotive though our industrial business is growing in that country too. With respect to bookings by market sector, bookings were up in each of our major markets that represent 86% of our business, industrial, transportation and communications and our smaller markets, military space grew modestly, while computer and consumer showed declines. The computer market, particularly PCs and notebooks, continue to be particularly weak. Industrial continues to be our largest market at 44% of our bookings, up from 43% the previous quarter. Industrial bookings increased in each of our major geographic regions led by North America and Europe. The breadth of this increase across our customer base is giving us some comfort that the noticeable weakness we experienced in this market over the past several months is in recovery and that the inventory correction that resulted is behind us. We believe we are shipping to end customer demand and the inventories in the channel and at the OEMs are at least stable, if not lean. Turning to transportation bookings, this market continues to show the highest percentage growth and it was 24% of our businesses that quarter, up from 23%. The increase in bookings in transportation was driven primarily by Asia-Pacific, but we saw growth in Japan and the U.S. as well. The U.S. has been a smaller transportation market for us, but we are making good strides here and is up nicely for the quarter in percentage terms and opportunities continues to increase. Europe bookings were down in transportation modestly in the quarter, but coming off a relatively strong Q2. Transportation growth in Asia-Pacific continues to be strong and it was our highest region in total transportation bookings overtaking both Europe and Japan for the first time. As you should know by now, we have been particularly successful with our parts in the China and Korea market. As I have noticed on previous calls, China is all-in on electric vehicles as one part of the solution for their severe air pollution offering incentives to both businesses and consumers to build and buy electric vehicles, including autos, taxis and buses. Our superior BMS parts have won a significant business in China, where we enjoy very high market share for battery management systems. Our transportation business in this region should continue to grow strongly for the foreseeable feature. Communications remained at 18% of our bookings for the quarter, but after two quarters of sequential growth, we are hopeful that this market is beginning to show some life. The large base stations and infrastructure piece of this market continues to be weak, but that is no longer a sizable piece of our communications business. We are seeing growth in optical, networking and datacom, which is the area of the market that we focus. This market was strongest for us in the U.S., while Europe was flat and Asia was down slightly. The computer market was 6% of our bookings, down from 7% last quarter with the decrease primarily in North America, where the majority of this business is booked. As stated last quarter, this market is down as expected as it is suffering due to weaker notebook sales and storage devices. This market may continue to decline a bit more for us over the short-term as notebook sales continue to decline. But longer term, we expect growth opportunities as we have compelling products in development that address the higher end of this market where innovation and superior functionality are still needed. Bookings for military space and harsh environment products increased modestly this quarter and remained at 6% of our business. Military has rebounded slowly from the weakness we experienced in the first quarter, while the space business has been somewhat flat for the past year. We do expect the space business to pick up as satellite launch activity increases. This is predominantly a U.S. market that we do book some business in Europe. Both regions saw an increase in bookings this quarter. Finally, consumer, our smallest end market where we take business opportunistically when functionality and performance still matter, this market decreased to 2% of our business, down from 3% last quarter. With regard to our bookings are actually created, 62% were created internationally and 38% in North America, the same as last period. Moving to sales, sales increased by 4% from the prior quarter and were down 2.9% from the prior year quarter. Geographically, sales were up the most in Europe followed by North America and Asia-Pacific, but were down in Japan, which is not unusual as March is typically their fiscal year end. U.S. sales were up for both OEM and distribution where revenue is recognized on a sell-through basis. On a regional basis, North America was 28% of our business, up from 27% last quarter. Europe was up to 21% this quarter from 19% last quarter. Japan declined to 13% of our business down from 15% last quarter and Asia-Pacific decreased from 39% to 38% of sales, but was up in absolute dollars. Turning to the rest of the income statement, gross margin was up from 75.7% to 76.2%. This is a good result, particularly since our overseas assembly and test operations have lowered production days due to Chinese New Year. Gross margin was aided by the higher sales base, which reduces fixed overhead per unit and an increase in our average selling price to $1.97, up $0.05 from $1.92 last quarter. The fourth quarter is a full production quarter for all of our plants and we expect to grow sales. So I do expect some margin expansion subject to the product mix within sales. R&D decreased $0.2 million sequentially to $69.6 million primarily due to lower labor and fringe costs as there was one extra week in the prior quarter. In addition, legal costs were down. Partially offsetting these decreases, vacation costs and profit-sharing increased. Vacation costs were higher as there were no shutdown days and much less vacation taken in the third quarter than during the holiday season. SG&A decreased $0.4 million sequentially to $43 million. Similar to R&D, this was mostly due to lower labor and fringe costs from one less week in the quarter compared to Q2. In addition, other cost decrease such as advertising, travel and foreign sales costs from foreign exchange. Similar to R&D, these declines were partially offset by higher vacation costs and profit-sharing. Operating income increased by $13 million to $162.5 million, representing 45% of our sales. Interest and other income increased slightly to $1.6 million on higher invested cash, net of small loss from foreign currency transactions. Our quarterly effective income tax rate was higher this quarter at 21.75% versus 19.5% last quarter due to lower quarterly discrete items. Next quarter absent discrete tax items, if any, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 24.5% range. Net income for the period was $128.4 million, up $6.9 million and was 35.6% of sales, up from 35%. The average shares outstanding used in the calculation of earnings per share decreased by 116,000 shares. The weighted average of stock repurchases, both this period and last period more than offset vesting of employee stock awards. GAAP earnings per share was $0.52, up from $0.50 in the prior quarter. Without the impact of stock-based compensation of $19.9 million, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.59 per share. Looking at just a few major components of our balance sheet, during the current quarter the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $55.3 million to $1.36 billion, net of spending $78.2 million of cash dividends which have been increased to $0.32 per share and spending $32.6 million on stock purchases of approximately 800,000 shares. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $13.2 million. Accounts receivable of $152.9 million increased by $7.8 million on the higher sales base and DSO was 39 days, up from 38 days as we had an extra week of collections in the second quarter. Inventory at $94.2 million was essentially flat versus the prior quarter and we believe to be in good profile to support our business and keep lead times relatively short. Our quarterly average inventory terms was up slightly to 3.7x per year. Looking forward, at the current bookings rate, we are guiding revenue to be up 2% to 5% in the June quarter. Three quarters ago, we announced that revenues for our first fiscal quarter would be down significantly, our expectation was that the sudden drop was more of a short-term correction rather than a deep down cycle. At this point, it appears that our reading of the tea leaves was accurate. Inventories in the channel now appear to be imbalanced, if not lean. We are shipping to end customer demand, bookings have picked up and our largest market, industrial appears to be in recovery. However, it is still a fragile market. The global macroeconomic climate is not particularly favorable when certain geographies remain weak and GDP of 2% is considered good growth. Nevertheless, we feel good about our strategy and the growth opportunities ahead in the markets where we have focused our resources and product development, particularly in the industrial, transportation and communications markets. These are the markets that will drive the growth in high performance analog and the decisions that we made several years ago and executed upon now leave us well positioned to capitalize. I will now open up the conference call to questions to be addressed to Bob, Lothar or me. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. David Wong Thank you very much. Don could you give us some feel of your attitude to cash on the balance sheet and use of cash and in particular, what you see in terms of stock repurchases going forward? Don Zerio Yes. David as you know, we retired our convertible note. Its been about 2 years now. And after having debt service for 7 years, we enjoy not having it. So for the time being, we continue to like not having the debt service. We prefer to use our existing cash to fund our dividends and stock repurchases. And so for the time period, that position hasnt changed. But its not that we are necessarily against taking some debt. We have done it in the past. But currently, we have chosen to use our existing cash to fund our stock repurchases. David Wong Great. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Craig Hettenbach Great. Thank you. Just a question or comment on China and EVs, just in terms of certainly its still a small market as a percentage terms, but the dollar content opportunity is much higher, I am curious to get your thoughts on just from a design perspective and what you are seeing from customers having influences what you think about the opportunity over the next 1 year, 2 years, 3 years? Lothar Maier When you think about China, particularly when we talked about is this EV market, its not just cars, its taxis and to a large extent, its also buses and some machinery. So its  and when we win business on the BMS side, we typically win business around the rest of the car as well. So granted these types of vehicles are so relatively small percentage, the content can be 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 10x as much as in the conventional car and the numbers may be were small, but appear to be getting quite a bit bigger. If you look at how many plug-in and electric cars China produced in 2015, it was around 300,000. And thats going to double, we think in 16. And right now, with the incentives that the Chinese government has put in place, there dont appear to be an end to this. Craig Hettenbach Got it. And then if I could just follow-up just on the topic of BMS, I think you guys are in your third or fourth generation of products, so just seemingly its a big opportunity, but just kind of things you are doing on the technology front to make sure that you maintain kind of a leadership position for these type of products? Lothar Maier Yes. And its interesting because every OEM does it a little bit different. So there isnt like one solution that solves everybodys problems. Some people have efficiency, some people want precision, some customers want communication. So its a different set of requirements from customer to customer. And so its just an ever evolving field and its  the requirements are, obviously its precision. The lithium batteries are very expensive. And so if we can make the measurements more precise, it means they have to purchase less batteries. When your battery system stops working in a vehicle, thats a plug-in or a hybrid, the car stops. So they are looking for things like redundancy and backup systems, so its a pretty complicated product with a lot of different hooks in it and every different  every OEM has a different hop button. Craig Hettenbach Okay. Thanks for that color. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Ross Seymore Hi, guys. Congrats on the solid quarter and guide. Just had a question on the ASP side of the equation, Don, you mentioned the benefit that, that had a little bit to the gross margin, but just kind of more holistically I think that $1.97 was up nicely sequentially and year-over-year, but I think its also the highest we have seen for your company as far as I can find in history. Can you just talk a little bit about what is driving ASPs up for your company over time and if in the single quarter there was any particularly unique movements? Don Zerio Well, I think just in general, the strategy change that we made several years ago as you know to defocus on the consumer and more towards industrial and transportation and communications just over the last several years that strategy in and of itself is going to help our ASP and it did. And you also know that we have had good success in our module business which continues to grow quite frankly beyond our expectations and not to know the great product that we continue to see just running. And the ASP on the modules is quite high and we are also talking today about our success with battery management systems, which also is a relatively high ASP product. So, our strategy in general and the success of certain of our products is continuing to drive ASP higher and it certainly wouldnt surprise us if we got over $2. Lothar Maier Yes. Just to highlight, we used to have ASPs even greater than $2 for a prolonged period of time. You would have to go back about 15 years to see that. And as we entered into the consumer business, we saw our ASPs drop. I think the low quarter for us was like $1.38. And then we have seen a steady growth back to what we think is probably likely for us is to get above $2 here in the future. And we feel that way for the reasons that Don said. We have got these BMS products. We have module products. And if you look at virtually everything that we have got in the design pipeline are really products that should warrant prices above $2. Ross Seymore Great. And I guess as my follow-up just switching gears to the industrial side, its good to see that its acting better and you gave a lot of color on that. I guess if we could just compare it to a year ago at this time, it looks like your revenues are in the same ballpark for what you have reported in the March quarter and seemingly what you are guiding for that sub-segment in June. Could you just compare and contrast what gives you the confidence and how you are feeling about that at the same level of revenues today versus a year ago, when of course we are on the precipice of that correction short-lived, but correction nonetheless in the September quarter? Lothar Maier Yes. I mean, prior to that correction, we were on a pretty good March in terms of improvements in our industrial business. And I think we had a correction for, quite frankly, reasons I dont fully understand, because we didnt lose any customers, we didnt lose any business. And so I think what we are seeing now is that industrial business that roughly a year ago was doing pretty good for us resetting and taking off where we were about a year ago. Ross Seymore Good. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead. Evan Wang Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. This is Evan Wang calling in for Tore Svanberg. Thank you for taking my questions. First question is on the communications, you have talked about it potentially being on rebound, I was wondering if you can characterize just a little bit based on maybe the bookings from your first couple of weeks so far this quarter as to the steepness of this recovery and going forward even out a couple of quarters if you could? Lothar Maier Well, its  any of our markets really dont get driven by whats happened in the first few weeks of a quarter. These things evolve literally over years. And we have seen some stress on our communications business, because historically it was roughly evenly split between the base station and the networking part of the business. And over the years, what we have been seeing is the base stations, which has become somewhat commodisized, that business declining and the rest of the business, sort of the networking and infrastructure part of the business improving. And so I think what we are seeing now is the fact that we have given up most of the base station business. We dont have a lot of base station business to lose anymore and what we are seeing is just the pickup of the networking business, which we have been seeing really for years and thats becoming a little bit conspicuous now. There are also some segments in the networking business that are doing well. Don mentioned the optical business. Wherever there is a lot of innovation, its typically where Linear does well and the optical markets going between 10G to 20G to 40G to 100 to 200, 400G. As that progression goes, there is a lot of technology involved. And when that happens thats good for us. And so for us the optical market right now is doing quite well. Evan Wang Great. My follow-up question is for the longer term, you cited that the macro remains weak and given the strength in your focused markets, is this still a major concern for you or do you see the strength in these markets sufficient to fuel your growth? Lothar Maier Its an issue for us. We really like to see some strong global GDP growth. So, its an obvious headwind to us, but at the moment I think we have got enough good products and good markets that we can buck that headwind to some extent. But quite frankly, we have a lot stronger business if we werent facing headwind like that. Don Zerio You know, I mentioned Japan. Japan is weak. I mean, there was definitely some seasonality with Japan this past quarter. As I mentioned, March is typically their fiscal year end. And so that will take less delivery and such, but I think there is some real weakness in Japan. I think they maybe affected by China somewhat, but they are still like we said there are still pockets of weakness out there. There is not many reasons around the world if at all that experience any kind of growth, something 3% or better. I mean, you dont even see that. Like I said, 2% is considered strong. So certainly not a great market out there, but I think in the markets that we focused, we are certainly holding our own and we cant use the macroeconomic environment as an excuse. We have to continue to grow and we think we can do that. Evan Wang Thank you very much. Operator And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Pitzer Yes, good morning guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Don, in your prepared comments you talked about your expectation for the June quarter for there to be additional gross margin leverage based upon sort of fixed cost absorption maybe offset by mix. Can you help us quantify how much we should see for the June quarter? Is this a similar incremental margin that we have seen in March? And then on a similar vein, if you look at where gross margin are today and I always feel silly about asking this question, you are still about 200 basis points of upside to where margins were kind of back in that 2010 time period around 78%. Is there anything structurally different about the business today that shouldnt allow you to, at some point, get back to that margin profile? Don Zerio You know, John, you have to remember where we were in the market back in 2010. I mean, that was a snapback from the 2008-2009 credit crisis and recession. And so the whole market was, if you recall, was sort of pedal to the metal. Our factory utilization at that time was very high. We still had some consumer products that were lower ASP, but also lower cost that helped get to that very high gross margin, not that we cant get back there, but thats sort of the perfect environment to get back to a gross margin that is in excess of 78%. So, I think thats different and you have to look at what that environment is. And secondly, there is some cost to the automotive market, the quality and the reliability that is expected. So, yes, there is higher ASPs there, but the cost depending upon which product you are talking about has quite high test costs. So, there is that as well, but even on a slightly lower gross margin, the gross margin per unit is higher. So, we will make that trade-off everyday. So, there is  I mean, there is just a lot of variabilities that go into gross margin which is why I cant necessarily give you a target for what our gross margin is going to be next quarter. I dont know what the mix is going to be yet. I am not exactly sure what our capacity level will be in the factory. All I can say is, say look, we just grew about $13 million and added a half of  0.50 basis points. I dont know if I can promise another 50 basis points, but assuming we grow, assuming we have a relatively sort of constant kind of a mix on our products. I would expect that we would be able to add to gross margin in total, whether its 20 basis points or 30 basis points or even higher, I cant say right now. John Pitzer And thats helpful Don. And then Lothar, maybe as my follow-up, a question around growth and I understand that the compare is probably not there because there has been a lot of repositioning in the company, but if you look at the top line growth, since 2010, to the end of this year, its been sort of flattish and again a lot of repositioning within that 5-year period. I am kind of curious as how you think we should think about your growth rate from here given the repositioning and the focus of the company in the end markets. And if not on an absolute basis, relative to where the semi market is growing, how much faster do you think you can grow on an ongoing basis? Lothar Maier Yes. I think you got a pretty good observation there that 2010 as Don said earlier, was kind of a peak. There was a huge downturn and then there was a huge correction and then it corrected again after that correction. And if you look back in the last several years, we have seen steady but modest growth. And I think we need two things. One is we need the overall market to get better. And so if we are going to get back to what we always say we would like to grow or we think we are entitled to grow is 10%, we have got to get some decent GDP growth. If you look at our company from where we are positioned, from a product standpoint, from an end market standpoint, we couldnt be any better positioned than we are presently. So I am not worried at all about the things that are in our control because I think we have managed that pretty well. We just need a little bit of help from the market and there is no reason why we cant grow 8% or 10% in a year. I doubt  we do not have a product or a market issue. Don Zerio John, let me just follow-up on that. If you go back to 2014, we had about five quarters, if not six quarters in a row, where year-over-year we were growing in a high single-digit, 9%, 10%. And thats what we thought we could do and we thought we continue to do it when most of the consumer transition was behind us. So all the new business and new opportunities we now felt after several years of replacing business was now additive on top. And so we were sort of there and obviously after 2014, we fell off that pace as did certainly the rest of the market as well. But computer got weak, communications got weak, industrial got weak on us. So again there are some macroeconomic headwinds. But to Lothars point, with a little bit more stability and a little bit more growth on average around the globe, we think we can grow back up at that 10% range. And we think we have already shown we could do it. We just need some help from the market. John Pitzer Great. Thanks guys. Operator Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with ISI Group. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, when you think about consumer now when we had only a roughly $28 million run rate, clearly much more leveraged to your three core businesses, how should we think about normal seasonality patterns in this low growth environment coupled with that mix shift? Don Zerio For which market? C.J. Muse Sorry, I am thinking in aggregate for you guys. Don Zerio I am sorry C.J., can you ask that question again? C.J. Muse Sure, thinking about seasonal patterns in the back half of the year, recognizing that you are much more focused to your B2B business and less so on the consumer front and how that translates into what we should expect into the back half of the year? Don Zerio So are you asking about this sort of the seasonality of our business going forward? C.J. Muse Thats right. Don Zerio Well, there used to be sort of a somewhat regular pattern or cycle to our business several years ago and maybe the consumer component of that, that we had that at that one time was double-digits, maybe that factored into that. And so with consumer gone, there seems to be maybe a less of a normal pattern. But just in general, clearly the first half of the calendar year, our fiscal third and fourth quarters is seasonally strong for Linear, particularly because of our focus on industrial and transportation. So we assume that, that will stay that way going forward. We hope to grow in Q4. Going on beyond that, its very difficult to forecast this business over the next quarter just because of the economy and some variability in the business and our customers. But I mean we would expect that coming out of the fourth quarter, historically the first quarter has been a  first fiscal quarter has been flattish to up slightly, down slightly type of quarter. And then Q2 has generally, be  thats December quarter has generally been our weaker quarter when we go down slightly. Although even this past year, that pattern was changed because September was the down quarter and we were recovering in the December quarter. So you look at history and what happens and there is somewhat of a pattern there, but it seems to have changed every year. So I am not sure I would put too much on the seasonality, other than clearly the first half of the calendar year tends to be stronger quarters for us. I would think that, that would continue absent some major change. I hope that answers your question. C.J. Muse Yes, it does. Thats helpful. I guess moving to OpEx, you guided 31% or less of sales for the prior Q and you came in a little above that. Curious what drove that and how should we think about that percentage going into the June quarter. And then if I could sneak one last question, it would be are you seeing any impact in your business from the earthquake in Japan? Thank you. Don Zerio Well the latter one, I dont believe that we are seeing any impact, at least none that we know of yet. So thats the easy one. You know its funny, I guess I got caught on the one minor miss I made on the income statement, where I did say that I expected to be in the 31% range similar to Q1, if not better. And so at 31.2%, thats exactly where we were in our first quarter. So I think thats what I said. But in fairness, I expected it to be a little better. And there is two things that  and we are not talking about a lot of money. I think to get down to 31% that would have  our operating expense would have been about $600,000 or $700,000 less, not a lot. But one thing I didnt factor into is surprisingly its vacation. The way we do our accounting for vacation, I think its what the most companies do. It is when employees are taking vacation, you actually get a P&L benefit. And then when you are not taking vacation, vacation charges go up and its the way you accrue the vacation accrual. So one thing that I didnt factor is when you have a holiday period like Christmas and New Years and then we also had shutdowns as well, people use their vacations so that they can get paid rather than taking time off without pay. So this quarter, that sort of snapped back the other way, because after people used their vacation, there is hardly any vacation taken at all. So the impact of that, quite honestly was a little higher than I expected. And so at 31.2%, quite honestly I would have thought we would have done a little bit better. But going forward, I think that 31% of sales is give or take, is probably where you can find us. The second thing there and I think I have been talking about this for the last couple of quarters is on an annual basis, if you take out stock compensation, our operating expenses are generally increasing in the 3% to 4% range. And thats sort of typical. But stock compensation, which is non-cash, is increasing somewhat higher than that. And its solely because our older grants that were granted 5 years ago were granted in the low $30 range. Well, those are falling off and being replaced by higher grants. So that phenomenon is causing stock compensation to increase quarter-over-quarter, a little faster than the rest of our cash operating expenses. So, there is a little bit of pressure there. That will turn around eventually. But for now thats why you might see our operating expenses in total growing maybe a little higher than you would expect. C.J. Muse Very helpful. Thank you. Don Zerio Okay. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead. Craig Ellis Yes, thank you for taking the question and congratulations on the results, guys. Don, the first question is to you and its just a follow-up on the basis for the guidance. I think you predicated guidance range on bookings at current rates. So, can you just remind us what the monthly bookings linearity would typically look like in the fiscal fourth quarter? Don Zerio Well, this past quarter and which is not unusual when you see the bookings, we actually had slightly higher bookings in January, but they stabilized pretty well over at the quarter enough to allow us to grow as we said. But when you look at January, for example, its not unusual that bookings increased coming out of the December calendar year end and there might have been some pre-booking for Chinese New Year. So, thats why you got to be a little careful when you try to read into the next quarter when you are on the call based upon a couple of weeks of bookings for the current quarter, because there sometimes ends up being a spike just sort of coming out of the different fiscal periods. But I said I think we have seen just in general, our bookings per day have stabilized somewhat. So, we are hoping that, that will continue. We continue to talk to our customers and I think our feedback in general is they are feeling pretty good about their business. We talked about seasonality. And Q3 and Q4 are generally stronger for Linear Tech. They are stronger for transportation and industrial. The transportation market continues to grow nicely for us. So, just based upon that information, thats why we are feeling good about our position. Thats why we are feeling pretty good that we can continue to grow in the fourth quarter. And beyond that, we just really dont know. Its very difficult to forecast longer out, further out in the first quarter. So, we are just going to have to see what happens. Craig Ellis Okay. I am going to take another swing at it, because I was looking for something a little bit different. If we look back historically, would we typically see that May and June are about on par with the bookings intensity that would be seen in April or would they typically be North or South or is there not a discernible enough pattern to make a call on the intra-quarter linearity by month? Don Zerio I dont think there is enough of the pattern. Other than that generally, our bookings in the first calendar  first half of the calendar tend to be relatively strong to fuel the growth in those quarters. You know our lead times are relatively short at 4 to 6 weeks, so we dont have bookings that go out months and quarters to let us give us too much insight on the future. Lothar Maier Yes, I think what Dons saying is there is a nuance here. I mean, typically our bookings and billings are pretty doggone flat through a quarter. And there might be some inventory positioning our customers do at the end of the quarter that picks up the bookings at the beginning of the next quarter, but we are talking about nuances here, not  I mean, we dont have a hockey stick type pattern of our business. Its very, very linear both from a bookings and a billings standpoint. Craig Ellis Thats helpful. Follow-up guys. The follow-up question is to you, Lothar, it was helpful to get the color on the communications business, the base station mix out has been well known. You have been very transparent on that. My follow-up question though as you look at the trends in optical, networking and datacom, are you seeing differential rates of growth in any of those markets? And if so where are you seeing the better growth? And then related to that, can you give us some sense as to the size of those different businesses so we can put that growth in better context inside of communications? Thank you. Lothar Maier I would say where there is a lot of potential business for us going forward, I would say its in the optical area. As I mentioned earlier, there is a lot of innovation going on there. And the use of optical is expanding. It used to be the fiber was for long-haul communications. And most of that fiber is in the ground already. And really where fiber is becoming more and more important is shorter distance, within buildings, server rack to server rack in data centers. And so thats the area where very, very high-speed communications is needed and it needs to fit in, in a very, very small format and heat dissipation is a big issue. And so we have got solutions for those types of applications that make that optical market kind of a pretty interesting market for us right now. Craig Ellis Thanks, guys. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ambrish Srivastava Hi, thank you. And I will borrow the silly hat from John Pitzer from the earlier question. I just wanted to drill in a little bit more on the gross margin and he was right, its kind of silly to be asking that given where you guys are at. But based on everything you said, the ASPs seemed to have a secular trend upwards. On the auto side, should costs be, the cost penalty be abating as you improve your yields and then pick a normal as utilization, shouldnt gross margin then should have a secular upward trajectory if we look out longer term? Lothar Maier I think you are right. I mean, I think we are being maybe a little bit modest here in that. If I look back what happened in 2010, if those circumstances happened again to us now where if the growth really took off like we were seeing back then, I would feel pretty confident that we could get to 78% gross margins. I mean, we are talking about percentage or two. Our factories are not 100% loaded right now. And I think there is some efficiencies we can pick up. But again, this is  we are talking about a couple of 100 basis points. Ambrish Srivastava Yes, yes. And I wasnt asking for the next quarter. So, my quick follow-up then is on something you mentioned on the automotive side, you said U.S. you are underrepresented and you are seeing progress. What specific areas are you seeing progress in the U.S.? Thank you. Don Zerio Well, I think there is the vehicle itself and then there is the suppliers. And we play in all of that. I think clearly to-date we have been more successful with more of the luxury model cars in Europe and Japan and we have been successful with the electric cars in China. And thats not to say we havent been successful in the U.S., its just been more so on the international market. But I think that clearly the ADAS opportunities and the autonomous driving vehicle in the future, I think some  I think even the big three automakers in the U.S. dont want to be left behind there. And so they are started jumping as well. So, I think that type of market I think is coming more so from the U.S. and we certainly think we will play in there. And so in terms of dollars, I think internationally, the transportation business for us is driven mostly from over there, but we are definitely on a percentage basis are increasing the U.S. bookings and sales and we think thats going to continue to grow. Ambrish Srivastava Okay, thank you. Good luck guys. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya Thank you for taking my question. First one, on transportation, very impressive growth and I think you have mentioned the battery management system and the opportunity there. Could you give us a sense of the competitive landscape? Are you the only company in that space? Do you sense any competition in that space at all? Then beyond battery management systems, what are the other areas of focus in transportation? Lothar Maier As far as competition, we recognized probably almost a decade ago that there is going to be the emergence of these BMS products. And so we really were first to market with a viable product. And we are in a fourth generation product right now in production and we have got sixth and seventh generation products and beyond in development. And so granted its getting to be a visible market and competitors recognize it and so there are competitors in this space, but I think we, for the foreseeable future, have a pretty good technical lead relative to the competition. These are complicated chips. I mean, they are very, very complicated. And as I mentioned earlier, there is no way that one competitor is going to come in with one chip because every OEM has a different preference of what they want. And so there is many variations on the BMS product. So even though we kind of call it a product, its really a family of products. And I think we have got a good technical lead on the competition. In terms of automotive, in general there is just great opportunities. The car companies are announcing this 48-volt battery systems, you are going to see them starting with model year 16, 17 and beyond. You are going to see it really picking up. When that happens, there is good opportunities for us. Silicon Valley here is becoming the new Detroit. Every OEMs here in Silicon Valley, there is some speculation, there is some new entrants in the automotive business developing in Silicon Valley as well. The one electric car manufacturer here in Silicon Valley is doing well. And so I think the domestic market for us is going to be good for automotive. Its been a little bit slow for us when we dealt with sort of the big Detroit automobile companies. But we were I think a little bit hard on ourselves, because even though we didnt sell too much directly to the OEMs, we had a pretty good content in the U.S. cars because they buy a lot of subassemblies from overseas. And so what we are seeing now is sort of the indigenous design wins happening in the automotive market in the U.S., which we havent had really strong up until the last few years. Vivek Arya Got it. Very helpful. And as the follow-up, this is perhaps a broader industry question, but when I look at the industrial end market, not just for Linear but across the board, in the last few years, we have seen very modest 2%, 3%, 4% GDP like growth, but given that semiconductors are supposed to expand content in most of that end markets, why has growth been so low in industrial, are there puts and takes in parts of industrial that are growing versus declining and what is an acceptable growth rate in that end market? Thank you. Don Zerio Well, thats a hard one. One thing about the industrial business is 44% of our business is our largest market. There are so many customers, so many different types of businesses in that market. Its hard to infer trends and patterns. So I dont think I have a good answer for you and I dont think Lothar have either, because he is sitting there shaking his head. But I just think that over the last year or so, the global market as you said has been  hasnt been particularly strong and industrial market, I think you got to start with GDP. And so like we said we need the help from the market to grow that. But over the longer period of time when you look at the analog market, the growth markets have been industrial and transportation. And along with communications as well, thats where we focused our business. So we feel confident that this low growth that you have seen overall in industrial is going to turnaround and grow a bit faster. Again our sales, generally happen 2 years or 3 years out from when we get from our sales and our wins to production. So we see whats going on with our design wins that will ship in a couple of years. So we feel pretty confident that our strategy of focusing in on industrial markets is a good one and we feel strongly that you are going to see greater growth in industrial than what you have been seeing. Vivek Arya Okay, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead. Cody Acree Thanks guys for taking my questions. Maybe just following up there on industrial, can you talk about some of the subsets where you are starting to see some of the improvements in order visibility, maybe some of those profits that are still struggling and GDP dependent? Lothar Maier Yes. The industrial market is  nothing happens fast in the analog and nothing happens even slower, in fact in the industrial business. But if you kind of step back and look, there are some markets that are doing okay, the sort of the instrumentation market is doing well, the medical business is doing well for us. Anything attached to exploration and oil and gas right now is not particularly strong because of the obvious reasons, because of the low gas prices. Certainly if gas prices started to go up again, we would see a pick up in sort of the exploration part of the market. Some of the alternative energy subs where we are starting to see some interest in solar and wind, that could be a good market for us as well in the future. We take that up in the industrial business. So its like a thousand different stories. There is just not a big trend that falls through that market. And its not made up of big customers, its lot of medium-sized customers. So its not like one person or one customer dominates of this business. Cody Acree And maybe if I would just ask you to read the tea leaves I guess a little bit, as you push through beginning of the year and you started to see these better booking in parts of comps and throughout industrial and in transport, do you get a sense that this is really just a snapback from an inventory correction or a bit of seasonality or are you optimistic that you have build any momentum here that either because company specific or just end markets specific that is more than just a bounce back of an inventory correction? Lothar Maier Yes. I think we had momentum going into just prior to the drop in sales. And as I have mentioned earlier, there is no reason for the drop in sales. We didnt lose any customers. We didnt get kicked out of any programs. It just was an inventory reset and I think you are seeing that reset taking place here in the last couple of quarters. And I think we will pick up the momentum that we had before this inventory correction. And if you look at where we are strong in the industrial and the automotive segments of the analog market, that makes up 50% of the total analog market. And its the only two markets in analog that really have any sort of sustained growth. So its not like we are in the wrong markets. We are kind of in the right markets and we are strong in those markets and those markets are growing. So I think from a momentum standpoint, I think we are well positioned. Cody Acree Thanks guys. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Steve Smigie Great. Thanks a lot guys. I wanted to follow-up on the optical market, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about where you see your strengths are part-wise, so laser drivers, etcetera? And as this datacenter market ramps, are there certain distances, speeds that you are particularly good at that you think you are levered to? Lothar Maier Its not so much the speeds, meaning that when the speeds go up, there are some huge requirements. There are these very complicated ASICs that are involved in these optical systems. They have many, many power rails that needed to be powered. And it has to be done with very high efficiency because these things were in very small, compact, not very well cooled locations. And so there is a lot of electronics to get this optical stuff to work. And I think we have got some good solutions in small footprints. Our micro modules do well in that area. They have a footprint that you cant do discreetly so those products do well in optical. And its really in this sort of not the photonics part of it its in support of the electronics that goes into photonics. Steve Smigie Okay, great. And then just sort of nitpicking on the industrial here, but you guys talked about some pickup here, how much of that will be what you talked about a little bit there as just sort of returning back to normal demand post sort of an inventory correction versus end market demand picking up versus you guys just having good designs that are taking off, so I am just trying to get at how much of this is just to end market demand picking up versus good stuff that you guys have done? Don Zerio I think its a combination of both, really. I mean bookings back three quarters ago, they almost fell off the Cliff a little bit surprisingly and where customers that were booking at a steady pattern suddenly stopped booking and that was large customers as well as smaller customers. So I think there was a couple of quarters where they took their inventory levels down, maybe to coincide with their own lower growth, optimistic growth rates. But we said back then that even though there was weakness and you saw the decline in bookings, most of our customers and we are talking thousands were still optimistic about their business and they were growing. So, I think its probably both that they are getting back to their usual levels of booking, their inventories are in good profile, but we think we are growing from there. So, we think we have got growth ahead. This is more than just sort of a snapback from erection. Steve Smigie Great, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one question on the emerging products portfolio, you guys mentioned the micro module products I think in answer to one of the prior questions. It is one of the more interesting product areas, because it is more of sort of systems level focus system-in package. Question is what end markets or applications are you guys seeing most traction for these micro modules and how fast do you see these products grow and if you look at pipeline of your design wins? Lothar Maier Yes, these micro modules are not designed specifically for any end market. They tend to be, for the most part, pretty general purpose. We probably initially developed these products to access small and medium-sized customers, customers that we couldnt send our application engineers to visit. So, we have them these modules, which like you said is kind of a system in a package. Its a done analog solution. All they have to do is solder it down on a board. And that worked. We sell these to many, many small and medium size customers who dont have the in-house expertise. Somewhat to our surprise, they have also done very well in large and sophisticated customers who do have in-house analog capabilities, but we win that business really on two fronts. One front is because its done, they get a time to market advantage. And two, its in the footprints that even if they could do the analog design themselves, they could never do it in a small of a footprint. And so  but all those things are not directed to one specific market. We probably initially saw strength in sort of the communications market with the micro modules. Now its expanded to all over the place. We even have module now that goes into automotive applications. And my sense is we are probably going to see more of that as well. So, its not targeted to any specific end market. Harlan Sur Great. Thanks for the insights. Operator [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead. William Stein Great. Thank you for taking my question. Gentlemen, earlier on the call, I think there were a lot of questions around automotive and you have spoken at great length about battery management systems. I am wondering if you can talk to us, in particular in China, right, I am wondering if you could talk to us about demand trends as you anticipate them in the coming year as the incentives that the Chinese government is running right now would seem to annualize in the September timeframe. Do you think thats going to be a headwind to your automotive demand next year? Lothar Maier Thats a hard read. And all I can kind of say is well, I read the statistics about what the Chinese government is forecasting in terms of the sales of hybrids and electric and plug-in the hybrid vehicles. And they are certainly forecasting calendar year 16 is going to double from what it was in 15. Its going to double again. I dont know, the numbers are getting to be pretty large, but what we do know is that the market from our customer seems to be pretty strong. They are all saying they are going to grow going forward. We obviously take what our customers say sometimes with the grain of salt in terms of their forecast, but certainly the reaction we get from our customer base is that this isnt sort of a one-year type of event. The sense is this is going to continue. If you have traveled to China at all, if the pollution is incredibly bad and I think they just have to fundamentally do something and to address it, this is one of many things that they are doing. William Stein It sounds like your automotive exposure there maybe a bit more mix than unit dependent, so thats helpful, I get it. And one more if I could squeeze it in. Defense end markets, we have heard some companies suggest that the bids they are seeing from the big contractors, the larger customers in the space have become bigger and more strategic and I am wondering if you are seeing that bidding activity and whether its turned into any backlog that you might be able to discuss? Lothar Maier The mil space business for us has been pretty steady, meaning its been 6% of our business for a long time and it tends to grow approximately as the company grows. But you do make a good point. I cant say I have seen everything, but there is some rumblings out there that, that might get better. We pick up space in that as well and there is a lot of people out there trying to figure out how to put rockets and satellites into space and we participate in that business as well. So, there are some things that allow us to be a little bit more optimistic, but I cant say I have got anything I can put my finger on. William Stein Well, thats helpful. Thank you. Operator And gentlemen, it appears we have no more telephone questions at this time. Lothar Maier Okay. Thank you for joining us on our conference call today. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Have a good day. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude todays conference. We do thank you for your participation.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. David Wong Thank you very much. Don could you give us some feel of your attitude to cash on the balance sheet and use of cash and in particular, what you see in terms of stock repurchases going forward? Don Zerio Yes. David as you know, we retired our convertible note. Its been about 2 years now. And after having debt service for 7 years, we enjoy not having it. So for the time being, we continue to like not having the debt service. We prefer to use our existing cash to fund our dividends and stock repurchases. And so for the time period, that position hasnt changed. But its not that we are necessarily against taking some debt. We have done it in the past. But currently, we have chosen to use our existing cash to fund our stock repurchases. David Wong Great. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Craig Hettenbach Great. Thank you. Just a question or comment on China and EVs, just in terms of certainly its still a small market as a percentage terms, but the dollar content opportunity is much higher, I am curious to get your thoughts on just from a design perspective and what you are seeing from customers having influences what you think about the opportunity over the next 1 year, 2 years, 3 years? Lothar Maier When you think about China, particularly when we talked about is this EV market, its not just cars, its taxis and to a large extent, its also buses and some machinery. So its  and when we win business on the BMS side, we typically win business around the rest of the car as well. So granted these types of vehicles are so relatively small percentage, the content can be 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 10x as much as in the conventional car and the numbers may be were small, but appear to be getting quite a bit bigger. If you look at how many plug-in and electric cars China produced in 2015, it was around 300,000. And thats going to double, we think in 16. And right now, with the incentives that the Chinese government has put in place, there dont appear to be an end to this. Craig Hettenbach Got it. And then if I could just follow-up just on the topic of BMS, I think you guys are in your third or fourth generation of products, so just seemingly its a big opportunity, but just kind of things you are doing on the technology front to make sure that you maintain kind of a leadership position for these type of products? Lothar Maier Yes. And its interesting because every OEM does it a little bit different. So there isnt like one solution that solves everybodys problems. Some people have efficiency, some people want precision, some customers want communication. So its a different set of requirements from customer to customer. And so its just an ever evolving field and its  the requirements are, obviously its precision. The lithium batteries are very expensive. And so if we can make the measurements more precise, it means they have to purchase less batteries. When your battery system stops working in a vehicle, thats a plug-in or a hybrid, the car stops. So they are looking for things like redundancy and backup systems, so its a pretty complicated product with a lot of different hooks in it and every different  every OEM has a different hop button. Craig Hettenbach Okay. Thanks for that color. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Ross Seymore Hi, guys. Congrats on the solid quarter and guide. Just had a question on the ASP side of the equation, Don, you mentioned the benefit that, that had a little bit to the gross margin, but just kind of more holistically I think that $1.97 was up nicely sequentially and year-over-year, but I think its also the highest we have seen for your company as far as I can find in history. Can you just talk a little bit about what is driving ASPs up for your company over time and if in the single quarter there was any particularly unique movements? Don Zerio Well, I think just in general, the strategy change that we made several years ago as you know to defocus on the consumer and more towards industrial and transportation and communications just over the last several years that strategy in and of itself is going to help our ASP and it did. And you also know that we have had good success in our module business which continues to grow quite frankly beyond our expectations and not to know the great product that we continue to see just running. And the ASP on the modules is quite high and we are also talking today about our success with battery management systems, which also is a relatively high ASP product. So, our strategy in general and the success of certain of our products is continuing to drive ASP higher and it certainly wouldnt surprise us if we got over $2. Lothar Maier Yes. Just to highlight, we used to have ASPs even greater than $2 for a prolonged period of time. You would have to go back about 15 years to see that. And as we entered into the consumer business, we saw our ASPs drop. I think the low quarter for us was like $1.38. And then we have seen a steady growth back to what we think is probably likely for us is to get above $2 here in the future. And we feel that way for the reasons that Don said. We have got these BMS products. We have module products. And if you look at virtually everything that we have got in the design pipeline are really products that should warrant prices above $2. Ross Seymore Great. And I guess as my follow-up just switching gears to the industrial side, its good to see that its acting better and you gave a lot of color on that. I guess if we could just compare it to a year ago at this time, it looks like your revenues are in the same ballpark for what you have reported in the March quarter and seemingly what you are guiding for that sub-segment in June. Could you just compare and contrast what gives you the confidence and how you are feeling about that at the same level of revenues today versus a year ago, when of course we are on the precipice of that correction short-lived, but correction nonetheless in the September quarter? Lothar Maier Yes. I mean, prior to that correction, we were on a pretty good March in terms of improvements in our industrial business. And I think we had a correction for, quite frankly, reasons I dont fully understand, because we didnt lose any customers, we didnt lose any business. And so I think what we are seeing now is that industrial business that roughly a year ago was doing pretty good for us resetting and taking off where we were about a year ago. Ross Seymore Good. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead. Evan Wang Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. This is Evan Wang calling in for Tore Svanberg. Thank you for taking my questions. First question is on the communications, you have talked about it potentially being on rebound, I was wondering if you can characterize just a little bit based on maybe the bookings from your first couple of weeks so far this quarter as to the steepness of this recovery and going forward even out a couple of quarters if you could? Lothar Maier Well, its  any of our markets really dont get driven by whats happened in the first few weeks of a quarter. These things evolve literally over years. And we have seen some stress on our communications business, because historically it was roughly evenly split between the base station and the networking part of the business. And over the years, what we have been seeing is the base stations, which has become somewhat commodisized, that business declining and the rest of the business, sort of the networking and infrastructure part of the business improving. And so I think what we are seeing now is the fact that we have given up most of the base station business. We dont have a lot of base station business to lose anymore and what we are seeing is just the pickup of the networking business, which we have been seeing really for years and thats becoming a little bit conspicuous now. There are also some segments in the networking business that are doing well. Don mentioned the optical business. Wherever there is a lot of innovation, its typically where Linear does well and the optical markets going between 10G to 20G to 40G to 100 to 200, 400G. As that progression goes, there is a lot of technology involved. And when that happens thats good for us. And so for us the optical market right now is doing quite well. Evan Wang Great. My follow-up question is for the longer term, you cited that the macro remains weak and given the strength in your focused markets, is this still a major concern for you or do you see the strength in these markets sufficient to fuel your growth? Lothar Maier Its an issue for us. We really like to see some strong global GDP growth. So, its an obvious headwind to us, but at the moment I think we have got enough good products and good markets that we can buck that headwind to some extent. But quite frankly, we have a lot stronger business if we werent facing headwind like that. Don Zerio You know, I mentioned Japan. Japan is weak. I mean, there was definitely some seasonality with Japan this past quarter. As I mentioned, March is typically their fiscal year end. And so that will take less delivery and such, but I think there is some real weakness in Japan. I think they maybe affected by China somewhat, but they are still like we said there are still pockets of weakness out there. There is not many reasons around the world if at all that experience any kind of growth, something 3% or better. I mean, you dont even see that. Like I said, 2% is considered strong. So certainly not a great market out there, but I think in the markets that we focused, we are certainly holding our own and we cant use the macroeconomic environment as an excuse. We have to continue to grow and we think we can do that. Evan Wang Thank you very much. Operator And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Pitzer Yes, good morning guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Don, in your prepared comments you talked about your expectation for the June quarter for there to be additional gross margin leverage based upon sort of fixed cost absorption maybe offset by mix. Can you help us quantify how much we should see for the June quarter? Is this a similar incremental margin that we have seen in March? And then on a similar vein, if you look at where gross margin are today and I always feel silly about asking this question, you are still about 200 basis points of upside to where margins were kind of back in that 2010 time period around 78%. Is there anything structurally different about the business today that shouldnt allow you to, at some point, get back to that margin profile? Don Zerio You know, John, you have to remember where we were in the market back in 2010. I mean, that was a snapback from the 2008-2009 credit crisis and recession. And so the whole market was, if you recall, was sort of pedal to the metal. Our factory utilization at that time was very high. We still had some consumer products that were lower ASP, but also lower cost that helped get to that very high gross margin, not that we cant get back there, but thats sort of the perfect environment to get back to a gross margin that is in excess of 78%. So, I think thats different and you have to look at what that environment is. And secondly, there is some cost to the automotive market, the quality and the reliability that is expected. So, yes, there is higher ASPs there, but the cost depending upon which product you are talking about has quite high test costs. So, there is that as well, but even on a slightly lower gross margin, the gross margin per unit is higher. So, we will make that trade-off everyday. So, there is  I mean, there is just a lot of variabilities that go into gross margin which is why I cant necessarily give you a target for what our gross margin is going to be next quarter. I dont know what the mix is going to be yet. I am not exactly sure what our capacity level will be in the factory. All I can say is, say look, we just grew about $13 million and added a half of  0.50 basis points. I dont know if I can promise another 50 basis points, but assuming we grow, assuming we have a relatively sort of constant kind of a mix on our products. I would expect that we would be able to add to gross margin in total, whether its 20 basis points or 30 basis points or even higher, I cant say right now. John Pitzer And thats helpful Don. And then Lothar, maybe as my follow-up, a question around growth and I understand that the compare is probably not there because there has been a lot of repositioning in the company, but if you look at the top line growth, since 2010, to the end of this year, its been sort of flattish and again a lot of repositioning within that 5-year period. I am kind of curious as how you think we should think about your growth rate from here given the repositioning and the focus of the company in the end markets. And if not on an absolute basis, relative to where the semi market is growing, how much faster do you think you can grow on an ongoing basis? Lothar Maier Yes. I think you got a pretty good observation there that 2010 as Don said earlier, was kind of a peak. There was a huge downturn and then there was a huge correction and then it corrected again after that correction. And if you look back in the last several years, we have seen steady but modest growth. And I think we need two things. One is we need the overall market to get better. And so if we are going to get back to what we always say we would like to grow or we think we are entitled to grow is 10%, we have got to get some decent GDP growth. If you look at our company from where we are positioned, from a product standpoint, from an end market standpoint, we couldnt be any better positioned than we are presently. So I am not worried at all about the things that are in our control because I think we have managed that pretty well. We just need a little bit of help from the market and there is no reason why we cant grow 8% or 10% in a year. I doubt  we do not have a product or a market issue. Don Zerio John, let me just follow-up on that. If you go back to 2014, we had about five quarters, if not six quarters in a row, where year-over-year we were growing in a high single-digit, 9%, 10%. And thats what we thought we could do and we thought we continue to do it when most of the consumer transition was behind us. So all the new business and new opportunities we now felt after several years of replacing business was now additive on top. And so we were sort of there and obviously after 2014, we fell off that pace as did certainly the rest of the market as well. But computer got weak, communications got weak, industrial got weak on us. So again there are some macroeconomic headwinds. But to Lothars point, with a little bit more stability and a little bit more growth on average around the globe, we think we can grow back up at that 10% range. And we think we have already shown we could do it. We just need some help from the market. John Pitzer Great. Thanks guys. Operator Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with ISI Group. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, when you think about consumer now when we had only a roughly $28 million run rate, clearly much more leveraged to your three core businesses, how should we think about normal seasonality patterns in this low growth environment coupled with that mix shift? Don Zerio For which market? C.J. Muse Sorry, I am thinking in aggregate for you guys. Don Zerio I am sorry C.J., can you ask that question again? C.J. Muse Sure, thinking about seasonal patterns in the back half of the year, recognizing that you are much more focused to your B2B business and less so on the consumer front and how that translates into what we should expect into the back half of the year? Don Zerio So are you asking about this sort of the seasonality of our business going forward? C.J. Muse Thats right. Don Zerio Well, there used to be sort of a somewhat regular pattern or cycle to our business several years ago and maybe the consumer component of that, that we had that at that one time was double-digits, maybe that factored into that. And so with consumer gone, there seems to be maybe a less of a normal pattern. But just in general, clearly the first half of the calendar year, our fiscal third and fourth quarters is seasonally strong for Linear, particularly because of our focus on industrial and transportation. So we assume that, that will stay that way going forward. We hope to grow in Q4. Going on beyond that, its very difficult to forecast this business over the next quarter just because of the economy and some variability in the business and our customers. But I mean we would expect that coming out of the fourth quarter, historically the first quarter has been a  first fiscal quarter has been flattish to up slightly, down slightly type of quarter. And then Q2 has generally, be  thats December quarter has generally been our weaker quarter when we go down slightly. Although even this past year, that pattern was changed because September was the down quarter and we were recovering in the December quarter. So you look at history and what happens and there is somewhat of a pattern there, but it seems to have changed every year. So I am not sure I would put too much on the seasonality, other than clearly the first half of the calendar year tends to be stronger quarters for us. I would think that, that would continue absent some major change. I hope that answers your question. C.J. Muse Yes, it does. Thats helpful. I guess moving to OpEx, you guided 31% or less of sales for the prior Q and you came in a little above that. Curious what drove that and how should we think about that percentage going into the June quarter. And then if I could sneak one last question, it would be are you seeing any impact in your business from the earthquake in Japan? Thank you. Don Zerio Well the latter one, I dont believe that we are seeing any impact, at least none that we know of yet. So thats the easy one. You know its funny, I guess I got caught on the one minor miss I made on the income statement, where I did say that I expected to be in the 31% range similar to Q1, if not better. And so at 31.2%, thats exactly where we were in our first quarter. So I think thats what I said. But in fairness, I expected it to be a little better. And there is two things that  and we are not talking about a lot of money. I think to get down to 31% that would have  our operating expense would have been about $600,000 or $700,000 less, not a lot. But one thing I didnt factor into is surprisingly its vacation. The way we do our accounting for vacation, I think its what the most companies do. It is when employees are taking vacation, you actually get a P&L benefit. And then when you are not taking vacation, vacation charges go up and its the way you accrue the vacation accrual. So one thing that I didnt factor is when you have a holiday period like Christmas and New Years and then we also had shutdowns as well, people use their vacations so that they can get paid rather than taking time off without pay. So this quarter, that sort of snapped back the other way, because after people used their vacation, there is hardly any vacation taken at all. So the impact of that, quite honestly was a little higher than I expected. And so at 31.2%, quite honestly I would have thought we would have done a little bit better. But going forward, I think that 31% of sales is give or take, is probably where you can find us. The second thing there and I think I have been talking about this for the last couple of quarters is on an annual basis, if you take out stock compensation, our operating expenses are generally increasing in the 3% to 4% range. And thats sort of typical. But stock compensation, which is non-cash, is increasing somewhat higher than that. And its solely because our older grants that were granted 5 years ago were granted in the low $30 range. Well, those are falling off and being replaced by higher grants. So that phenomenon is causing stock compensation to increase quarter-over-quarter, a little faster than the rest of our cash operating expenses. So, there is a little bit of pressure there. That will turn around eventually. But for now thats why you might see our operating expenses in total growing maybe a little higher than you would expect. C.J. Muse Very helpful. Thank you. Don Zerio Okay. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead. Craig Ellis Yes, thank you for taking the question and congratulations on the results, guys. Don, the first question is to you and its just a follow-up on the basis for the guidance. I think you predicated guidance range on bookings at current rates. So, can you just remind us what the monthly bookings linearity would typically look like in the fiscal fourth quarter? Don Zerio Well, this past quarter and which is not unusual when you see the bookings, we actually had slightly higher bookings in January, but they stabilized pretty well over at the quarter enough to allow us to grow as we said. But when you look at January, for example, its not unusual that bookings increased coming out of the December calendar year end and there might have been some pre-booking for Chinese New Year. So, thats why you got to be a little careful when you try to read into the next quarter when you are on the call based upon a couple of weeks of bookings for the current quarter, because there sometimes ends up being a spike just sort of coming out of the different fiscal periods. But I said I think we have seen just in general, our bookings per day have stabilized somewhat. So, we are hoping that, that will continue. We continue to talk to our customers and I think our feedback in general is they are feeling pretty good about their business. We talked about seasonality. And Q3 and Q4 are generally stronger for Linear Tech. They are stronger for transportation and industrial. The transportation market continues to grow nicely for us. So, just based upon that information, thats why we are feeling good about our position. Thats why we are feeling pretty good that we can continue to grow in the fourth quarter. And beyond that, we just really dont know. Its very difficult to forecast longer out, further out in the first quarter. So, we are just going to have to see what happens. Craig Ellis Okay. I am going to take another swing at it, because I was looking for something a little bit different. If we look back historically, would we typically see that May and June are about on par with the bookings intensity that would be seen in April or would they typically be North or South or is there not a discernible enough pattern to make a call on the intra-quarter linearity by month? Don Zerio I dont think there is enough of the pattern. Other than that generally, our bookings in the first calendar  first half of the calendar tend to be relatively strong to fuel the growth in those quarters. You know our lead times are relatively short at 4 to 6 weeks, so we dont have bookings that go out months and quarters to let us give us too much insight on the future. Lothar Maier Yes, I think what Dons saying is there is a nuance here. I mean, typically our bookings and billings are pretty doggone flat through a quarter. And there might be some inventory positioning our customers do at the end of the quarter that picks up the bookings at the beginning of the next quarter, but we are talking about nuances here, not  I mean, we dont have a hockey stick type pattern of our business. Its very, very linear both from a bookings and a billings standpoint. Craig Ellis Thats helpful. Follow-up guys. The follow-up question is to you, Lothar, it was helpful to get the color on the communications business, the base station mix out has been well known. You have been very transparent on that. My follow-up question though as you look at the trends in optical, networking and datacom, are you seeing differential rates of growth in any of those markets? And if so where are you seeing the better growth? And then related to that, can you give us some sense as to the size of those different businesses so we can put that growth in better context inside of communications? Thank you. Lothar Maier I would say where there is a lot of potential business for us going forward, I would say its in the optical area. As I mentioned earlier, there is a lot of innovation going on there. And the use of optical is expanding. It used to be the fiber was for long-haul communications. And most of that fiber is in the ground already. And really where fiber is becoming more and more important is shorter distance, within buildings, server rack to server rack in data centers. And so thats the area where very, very high-speed communications is needed and it needs to fit in, in a very, very small format and heat dissipation is a big issue. And so we have got solutions for those types of applications that make that optical market kind of a pretty interesting market for us right now. Craig Ellis Thanks, guys. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ambrish Srivastava Hi, thank you. And I will borrow the silly hat from John Pitzer from the earlier question. I just wanted to drill in a little bit more on the gross margin and he was right, its kind of silly to be asking that given where you guys are at. But based on everything you said, the ASPs seemed to have a secular trend upwards. On the auto side, should costs be, the cost penalty be abating as you improve your yields and then pick a normal as utilization, shouldnt gross margin then should have a secular upward trajectory if we look out longer term? Lothar Maier I think you are right. I mean, I think we are being maybe a little bit modest here in that. If I look back what happened in 2010, if those circumstances happened again to us now where if the growth really took off like we were seeing back then, I would feel pretty confident that we could get to 78% gross margins. I mean, we are talking about percentage or two. Our factories are not 100% loaded right now. And I think there is some efficiencies we can pick up. But again, this is  we are talking about a couple of 100 basis points. Ambrish Srivastava Yes, yes. And I wasnt asking for the next quarter. So, my quick follow-up then is on something you mentioned on the automotive side, you said U.S. you are underrepresented and you are seeing progress. What specific areas are you seeing progress in the U.S.? Thank you. Don Zerio Well, I think there is the vehicle itself and then there is the suppliers. And we play in all of that. I think clearly to-date we have been more successful with more of the luxury model cars in Europe and Japan and we have been successful with the electric cars in China. And thats not to say we havent been successful in the U.S., its just been more so on the international market. But I think that clearly the ADAS opportunities and the autonomous driving vehicle in the future, I think some  I think even the big three automakers in the U.S. dont want to be left behind there. And so they are started jumping as well. So, I think that type of market I think is coming more so from the U.S. and we certainly think we will play in there. And so in terms of dollars, I think internationally, the transportation business for us is driven mostly from over there, but we are definitely on a percentage basis are increasing the U.S. bookings and sales and we think thats going to continue to grow. Ambrish Srivastava Okay, thank you. Good luck guys. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya Thank you for taking my question. First one, on transportation, very impressive growth and I think you have mentioned the battery management system and the opportunity there. Could you give us a sense of the competitive landscape? Are you the only company in that space? Do you sense any competition in that space at all? Then beyond battery management systems, what are the other areas of focus in transportation? Lothar Maier As far as competition, we recognized probably almost a decade ago that there is going to be the emergence of these BMS products. And so we really were first to market with a viable product. And we are in a fourth generation product right now in production and we have got sixth and seventh generation products and beyond in development. And so granted its getting to be a visible market and competitors recognize it and so there are competitors in this space, but I think we, for the foreseeable future, have a pretty good technical lead relative to the competition. These are complicated chips. I mean, they are very, very complicated. And as I mentioned earlier, there is no way that one competitor is going to come in with one chip because every OEM has a different preference of what they want. And so there is many variations on the BMS product. So even though we kind of call it a product, its really a family of products. And I think we have got a good technical lead on the competition. In terms of automotive, in general there is just great opportunities. The car companies are announcing this 48-volt battery systems, you are going to see them starting with model year 16, 17 and beyond. You are going to see it really picking up. When that happens, there is good opportunities for us. Silicon Valley here is becoming the new Detroit. Every OEMs here in Silicon Valley, there is some speculation, there is some new entrants in the automotive business developing in Silicon Valley as well. The one electric car manufacturer here in Silicon Valley is doing well. And so I think the domestic market for us is going to be good for automotive. Its been a little bit slow for us when we dealt with sort of the big Detroit automobile companies. But we were I think a little bit hard on ourselves, because even though we didnt sell too much directly to the OEMs, we had a pretty good content in the U.S. cars because they buy a lot of subassemblies from overseas. And so what we are seeing now is sort of the indigenous design wins happening in the automotive market in the U.S., which we havent had really strong up until the last few years. Vivek Arya Got it. Very helpful. And as the follow-up, this is perhaps a broader industry question, but when I look at the industrial end market, not just for Linear but across the board, in the last few years, we have seen very modest 2%, 3%, 4% GDP like growth, but given that semiconductors are supposed to expand content in most of that end markets, why has growth been so low in industrial, are there puts and takes in parts of industrial that are growing versus declining and what is an acceptable growth rate in that end market? Thank you. Don Zerio Well, thats a hard one. One thing about the industrial business is 44% of our business is our largest market. There are so many customers, so many different types of businesses in that market. Its hard to infer trends and patterns. So I dont think I have a good answer for you and I dont think Lothar have either, because he is sitting there shaking his head. But I just think that over the last year or so, the global market as you said has been  hasnt been particularly strong and industrial market, I think you got to start with GDP. And so like we said we need the help from the market to grow that. But over the longer period of time when you look at the analog market, the growth markets have been industrial and transportation. And along with communications as well, thats where we focused our business. So we feel confident that this low growth that you have seen overall in industrial is going to turnaround and grow a bit faster. Again our sales, generally happen 2 years or 3 years out from when we get from our sales and our wins to production. So we see whats going on with our design wins that will ship in a couple of years. So we feel pretty confident that our strategy of focusing in on industrial markets is a good one and we feel strongly that you are going to see greater growth in industrial than what you have been seeing. Vivek Arya Okay, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead. Cody Acree Thanks guys for taking my questions. Maybe just following up there on industrial, can you talk about some of the subsets where you are starting to see some of the improvements in order visibility, maybe some of those profits that are still struggling and GDP dependent? Lothar Maier Yes. The industrial market is  nothing happens fast in the analog and nothing happens even slower, in fact in the industrial business. But if you kind of step back and look, there are some markets that are doing okay, the sort of the instrumentation market is doing well, the medical business is doing well for us. Anything attached to exploration and oil and gas right now is not particularly strong because of the obvious reasons, because of the low gas prices. Certainly if gas prices started to go up again, we would see a pick up in sort of the exploration part of the market. Some of the alternative energy subs where we are starting to see some interest in solar and wind, that could be a good market for us as well in the future. We take that up in the industrial business. So its like a thousand different stories. There is just not a big trend that falls through that market. And its not made up of big customers, its lot of medium-sized customers. So its not like one person or one customer dominates of this business. Cody Acree And maybe if I would just ask you to read the tea leaves I guess a little bit, as you push through beginning of the year and you started to see these better booking in parts of comps and throughout industrial and in transport, do you get a sense that this is really just a snapback from an inventory correction or a bit of seasonality or are you optimistic that you have build any momentum here that either because company specific or just end markets specific that is more than just a bounce back of an inventory correction? Lothar Maier Yes. I think we had momentum going into just prior to the drop in sales. And as I have mentioned earlier, there is no reason for the drop in sales. We didnt lose any customers. We didnt get kicked out of any programs. It just was an inventory reset and I think you are seeing that reset taking place here in the last couple of quarters. And I think we will pick up the momentum that we had before this inventory correction. And if you look at where we are strong in the industrial and the automotive segments of the analog market, that makes up 50% of the total analog market. And its the only two markets in analog that really have any sort of sustained growth. So its not like we are in the wrong markets. We are kind of in the right markets and we are strong in those markets and those markets are growing. So I think from a momentum standpoint, I think we are well positioned. Cody Acree Thanks guys. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Steve Smigie Great. Thanks a lot guys. I wanted to follow-up on the optical market, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about where you see your strengths are part-wise, so laser drivers, etcetera? And as this datacenter market ramps, are there certain distances, speeds that you are particularly good at that you think you are levered to? Lothar Maier Its not so much the speeds, meaning that when the speeds go up, there are some huge requirements. There are these very complicated ASICs that are involved in these optical systems. They have many, many power rails that needed to be powered. And it has to be done with very high efficiency because these things were in very small, compact, not very well cooled locations. And so there is a lot of electronics to get this optical stuff to work. And I think we have got some good solutions in small footprints. Our micro modules do well in that area. They have a footprint that you cant do discreetly so those products do well in optical. And its really in this sort of not the photonics part of it its in support of the electronics that goes into photonics. Steve Smigie Okay, great. And then just sort of nitpicking on the industrial here, but you guys talked about some pickup here, how much of that will be what you talked about a little bit there as just sort of returning back to normal demand post sort of an inventory correction versus end market demand picking up versus you guys just having good designs that are taking off, so I am just trying to get at how much of this is just to end market demand picking up versus good stuff that you guys have done? Don Zerio I think its a combination of both, really. I mean bookings back three quarters ago, they almost fell off the Cliff a little bit surprisingly and where customers that were booking at a steady pattern suddenly stopped booking and that was large customers as well as smaller customers. So I think there was a couple of quarters where they took their inventory levels down, maybe to coincide with their own lower growth, optimistic growth rates. But we said back then that even though there was weakness and you saw the decline in bookings, most of our customers and we are talking thousands were still optimistic about their business and they were growing. So, I think its probably both that they are getting back to their usual levels of booking, their inventories are in good profile, but we think we are growing from there. So, we think we have got growth ahead. This is more than just sort of a snapback from erection. Steve Smigie Great, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one question on the emerging products portfolio, you guys mentioned the micro module products I think in answer to one of the prior questions. It is one of the more interesting product areas, because it is more of sort of systems level focus system-in package. Question is what end markets or applications are you guys seeing most traction for these micro modules and how fast do you see these products grow and if you look at pipeline of your design wins? Lothar Maier Yes, these micro modules are not designed specifically for any end market. They tend to be, for the most part, pretty general purpose. We probably initially developed these products to access small and medium-sized customers, customers that we couldnt send our application engineers to visit. So, we have them these modules, which like you said is kind of a system in a package. Its a done analog solution. All they have to do is solder it down on a board. And that worked. We sell these to many, many small and medium size customers who dont have the in-house expertise. Somewhat to our surprise, they have also done very well in large and sophisticated customers who do have in-house analog capabilities, but we win that business really on two fronts. One front is because its done, they get a time to market advantage. And two, its in the footprints that even if they could do the analog design themselves, they could never do it in a small of a footprint. And so  but all those things are not directed to one specific market. We probably initially saw strength in sort of the communications market with the micro modules. Now its expanded to all over the place. We even have module now that goes into automotive applications. And my sense is we are probably going to see more of that as well. So, its not targeted to any specific end market. Harlan Sur Great. Thanks for the insights. Operator [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead. William Stein Great. Thank you for taking my question. Gentlemen, earlier on the call, I think there were a lot of questions around automotive and you have spoken at great length about battery management systems. I am wondering if you can talk to us, in particular in China, right, I am wondering if you could talk to us about demand trends as you anticipate them in the coming year as the incentives that the Chinese government is running right now would seem to annualize in the September timeframe. Do you think thats going to be a headwind to your automotive demand next year? Lothar Maier Thats a hard read. And all I can kind of say is well, I read the statistics about what the Chinese government is forecasting in terms of the sales of hybrids and electric and plug-in the hybrid vehicles. And they are certainly forecasting calendar year 16 is going to double from what it was in 15. Its going to double again. I dont know, the numbers are getting to be pretty large, but what we do know is that the market from our customer seems to be pretty strong. They are all saying they are going to grow going forward. We obviously take what our customers say sometimes with the grain of salt in terms of their forecast, but certainly the reaction we get from our customer base is that this isnt sort of a one-year type of event. The sense is this is going to continue. If you have traveled to China at all, if the pollution is incredibly bad and I think they just have to fundamentally do something and to address it, this is one of many things that they are doing. William Stein It sounds like your automotive exposure there maybe a bit more mix than unit dependent, so thats helpful, I get it. And one more if I could squeeze it in. Defense end markets, we have heard some companies suggest that the bids they are seeing from the big contractors, the larger customers in the space have become bigger and more strategic and I am wondering if you are seeing that bidding activity and whether its turned into any backlog that you might be able to discuss? Lothar Maier The mil space business for us has been pretty steady, meaning its been 6% of our business for a long time and it tends to grow approximately as the company grows. But you do make a good point. I cant say I have seen everything, but there is some rumblings out there that, that might get better. We pick up space in that as well and there is a lot of people out there trying to figure out how to put rockets and satellites into space and we participate in that business as well. So, there are some things that allow us to be a little bit more optimistic, but I cant say I have got anything I can put my finger on. William Stein Well, thats helpful. Thank you. Operator And gentlemen, it appears we have no more telephone questions at this time. Lothar Maier Okay. Thank you for joining us on our conference call today. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Have a good day. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude todays conference. We do thank you for your participation.

Joining us today from Zurich are Bracken Darrell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Vincent Palette, Chief Financial Officer. And now I'll turn the call over to Bracken. Bracken Darrell Thanks a lot, Ben and thanks to all of you for joining us. Let me start by talking about few of the products we've introduced this year. It's just a fraction of the total. We launched our first ever completely Pro Gaming Mouse. We love eSports and we want to be a partner to the people making eSports the most exciting and the fastest growing sport in the world, the athletes and the coaches. The [indiscernible] of eSports will now be an official event of the 2022 Asian Games. Who knows, it might even be an Olympics sport one day soon. We made listening to music out loud even more social.  We upgraded our prior BOOM and MEGABOOM products again and again and most recently with PartyUp, unless you connect really to an unlimited number of speakers together to create an incredible group listing experience. And just earlier this month we released our latest mobile speaker, the Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM. It's waterproof, it's practically break proof and the volume and sound quality is as good as the original BOOM 1, all for just $99. We introduced the SmartDock and extent our lineup of video collaboration enabling Skype with a push of a button. It's a terrific complement to our any-size meeting room offerings. And even as we've entered and now are growing new businesses by double digits, we're not letting up on our regional core. Dolomites, multi-device keyboards and our latest the reinventing of the clicker, all part of our product highlight this year. A minute on that clicker reinvention. Spotlight we just launched. It's a breakthrough way to present and it's the coolest way to give a presentation. Spotlighting or magnifying instead of laser pointing. Every time I use it with people, as I just did this morning here in Zurich, people come up and ask me, how to buy it. While we're an organic innovation company, we're sharpening our skills in acquisitions and integration. This is enabling us to accelerate our entry in the seats basis. Jabber and Cytec help us accelerated a Bluetooth earphones in simulation gaming. Both are off to good starts and we're learning a lot. Now let me give you a quick rundown of this year's performance by business and region. The Q4 and full-year performance are consistent, so I'm going to focus on the year. We grew across all our regions and almost all of our categories. PC peripheral categories remain healthy with sales up 7% for the year. Consumers continue to use PCs as they add model computing on top of PC usage. We use computers for productivity and we use our phones for almost everything. Keyboards and combos sales increased 12%. This is the 7th consecutive year of growth. Pointing devices rose 2%. And we won't stop innovating in My Sport keyboards. Webcams grew 9% behind the rise of streaming. Sales of tablet and other accessories category fell 26% in line with performance in the broader tablet market. We expect this steep Q4 drop compared to Q4 a year ago, when we reintroduced in one of the second full quarter -- or the first full quarter of the create keyboard for the iPad Pro. Video collaboration increased 42%, powerful across all three regions all year long. Mobile speakers sales grew 30%, the head of our regional expectation heading into the year. Despite not having any new hardware product introductions, we leveraged software and our go-to-market capabilities to drive market share gains and deliver that growth. The Jabber, you might recall last quarter, we mentioned supply constraints that held us back and we committed that we would fix that. We did and now Jabber supply is where it should be. In fact, Jabber contributed 3 points not only to the full year but also in Q4.Gaming sales grew 28%. Even if we continue to grow well on gaming, there's just a lot of exciting credential in every segment of the gaming business. Now I'm going to pass it to over to Vincent to go through some financial performance detail. Vincent Pilette Thanks, Bracken. Very consistently with our performance through the year, we finished the year-end quarter with another strong and board-based performance, double digit sales growth across our regions and our main product categories. Q4 retail sales grew 17% to $496 million and our fiscal year 2017 sales grew 14% to $2.2 billion. We have not seen this level of growth since fiscal year 2011 and today our market growth opportunities are a lot bigger. On top of that, our Q4 non-GAAP operating profits increased 61% to $36 million and our full year's non-GAAP operating income grew 33% to a better than expected $238 million. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.21 in Q4 and $1.32 in fiscal year 2017, up 35% versus last year. These results reflect the strength of our business model and our discipline execution. At our Analyst and Investor Day, we laid out our fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP EPS road map of $2. This would be double the level of earnings we saw in fiscal year 2016. And the $1.32 we just delivered this past year demonstrates our clear progress towards this goal. As we look out to fiscal year 2020, we will continue to push for strong and sustainable top line growth, while at the same time reinvest our gross profits into our 5 key capabilities that constitute the foundation of our long term financial model. Our Q4 non-GAAP gross margin increased 430 basis points to a robust 37.4%. In fact, our margin remained flat sequentially despite the sequential seasonal decline in sales. This is a great example of how we continue to improve our cost structure ahead of plan benefiting from higher volumes and our design forecast programs. It puts us in a healthy position to reinvest our gross profit dollars to support our long term growth objectives while continuing to create operating leverage. Our Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses rose 24% to $149 million with Jabber contributing 6 points of that increase.  For the year, non-GAAP operating expenses rose 14% or 10% excluding Jabber as we're making prudent investments to support our growth opportunities. While we invested in R&D and sales and marketing in the year, we reduced the infrastructure costs and drove G&A to below 4% of sales, a metric that we see as an external sign of improving our efficiency. For fiscal year 2017, our operating expense ratio was 26.1% of sales and on track towards our long term targets. Along with strong operating profits, we also generated robust levels of cash flows. In fiscal year 2017, cash flow from operations reached $279 million, up over 50% from $183 million last year. Our full year cash conversion cycle remained stable at 23 days, essentially unchanged versus a year ago and right in line with our annual target of 20 to 25 days. In fiscal year 2017, we returned $177 million of cash back to shareholders in the form of $93 million of dividends and $84 million of stock repurchases. Going forward, we will continue to return our free cash flow to our shareholders through a growing dividend and opportunistic share buyback. And now, I will turn it back to Bracken. Bracken Darrell Thanks, Vincent. I joined Logitech 5 years ago this month. Three things stand out as I look back that suggest a very strong future ahead. First, we proved that we can extend our portfolio. We love mouse and keyboards and we intend to have a nice business in them for a long time to come. But today they are less than 45% of our business as we're growing faster in an increasing number of new categories like video collaboration, gaming and others. Second, we arent just innovating in a few categories or countries. We have created an innovation-led growth engine that's growing all our regions in almost all our categories. This growth capability in retail and e-tail in a growing area of categories around the world is an exceptional strength versus the single category small companies. It's also unique for our size. Third, we proved we can consistently grow our business profitably. In a world where top line growth with lot of line losses is sometimes viewed as attractive, we have demonstrated that our ability to grow top line sales and increase profitability is possible in Logitech long term. We've almost quadrupled our profits and accelerated our growth over the past 4 years. But the most exciting fact of all is that the opportunities available to us are expanding dramatically.  For 30 years, our primary growth driver was the PC. While the PC industries flattened, mobile services are exploding. And there is and will be an expanding number of peripheral opportunities for these cloud services. We just gave our outlook for fiscal year 2018 a few weeks ago, so naturally today we're confirming that. And you can be sure that we're working to our long term model.[indiscernible] Vincent and I are ready to take your questions. Operator, please queue up the questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Tavis McCourt So a couple of questions. I guess, first if I do the math on the Jaybird operating expense, I'm assuming it's probably neutral to a little dilutive to the bottom line right now. And I guess, if you could give us a sense on kind of your game plan for scaling that business. Obviously it's in a big growth category, but maybe kind of the game plan for scaling that business to get it to a meaningful level of profitability? Secondly, Harmony Hub had a great quarter obviously, easy comp, but maybe give us a sense of the sell-through on that and how sustainable you think adding some of these voice assistance is maybe creating a new growth category there for you guys? And then finally, Vincent, just a [Technical Difficulty] if the top line growth continues to outperform how we should think about flow through to operating income this year? Bracken Darrell Okay. I'll take the middle one and let Vincent take both the Jaybird and top line growth. Vincent Pilette Yes. So I can take the first one. So, first one on Jaybird, right, so we enter or did the acquisition with the idea of running the business at somewhat a wrong directive point for [Technical Difficulty] investing for the future growth. We were on track. As you remember in Q3, we had a little bit of a supply issue that lowered the revenue compared to our expectation. We made the decision not to lower our investment because we're very confident in both the market opportunity and our portfolio and so for that reason we slightly diluted for the full year. But if you exclude that supply bump, if you want, in Q3 which we recovered in Q4, we're on track to our initial plan. For next year investment, it's built into our guidance. We're investing into expansion internationally, investing in Europe, investing in Asia heavily to take that brand off the ground and make it meaningful. We also investing for the long term, past the 12 months, long term portfolio roadmap where we think we have a lot of opportunity. So, definitely we expect this product line or, set of products if you want, to become more and more meaningful to our portfolio. That's what Jaybird. In term of the flow through, right, as we continue to grow high single digit and of course work every day to deliver that. We'll continue to expect a very healthy flow through. We achieved a high end of our initial margin target of 35% to 37%. At this point in time, we plan to use the incremental gross margin dollars if they come through to invest and build even at a more accelerated gross rate. So our focus really is on capturing the gross opportunities. Now with that said, we have a long term range of operating profit of 10% to 12% on the bottom line and we're just at the midpoint, starting of the midpoint 10.8%, 10.9% and so you will see a constant expansion of that operating profit margin as we continue to build our business. Bracken Darrell And on your Harmony question, I think -- I'd say we're guardedly optimistic. The performance over the last couple of quarters been really strong as we have activated through Amazon Echo and now Google Home. And I think, there are a couple of interesting facts about that, one is that about half of the users that come in are new users who are using -- based on what we can see from activation. So it makes you optimistic that this is an interesting one. And the other thing is we haven't seen a significant fall off after the first announcement, the first letter that went out from Amazon Echo for example or for Amazon on the integration. So, we'll see. We're not going to make any strong commitments on that, but we're optimistic and it's exciting to see. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Foeth with Vontobel. Michael Foeth One question regarding your -- the sell-in and sell-through dynamics in particular in EMEA where sell-in was low and sell-through was high and then in the Americas we had the opposite. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more explanation of what is going on there and how we should see that in the coming quarter? Vincent Pilette Yes, let me answer that first Michael. So, okay, before we talk about it region wide, so sell-in was around 15% U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currency. Sell-through is around 14% in dollar, so overall globally pretty stable. When you look at weeks on hand, whether it's backward looking or forward looking, you'd see them flat or slightly improving. So we feel really good about position overall in our inventory, somewhere in the midpoint of our target range and very stable to slightly improving year-over-year. So feel good on that one. When you look at by region, I don't know if you remember last year Q4 in Americas was exactly the reverse which was low sell-in, high sell-through and then this year we have in the EMEA that position. We have -- usually it's a dynamic management of our overall distribution footprint if you want and nothing specific at this point in time. Overall if you look at EMEA full year, sell-in is around 18% and we exit the year with sell-through at the rate of 19%, so nothing special at this point in time. Michael Foeth Okay. And may be just to follow on the high growth in the Americas, was that Jaybird or anything else? Vincent Pilette No, no. It's a function of, again, the compare. So at last year, sale in Americas was minus 8% on a positive DCS and therefore now of course you have the 5 that you compare against that very low. If you look at the trend on the growth rate in Americas, we've been trending at the high single digit, low double digit except Q4 '16 where we voluntarily were cautious on mobile speakers and the overall sale in Americas was minus 8%. So now of course a year later you compare against that. Michael Foeth And then just may be one last one on your distribution. Can you give us the development of the portion of online sales in Asia versus Americas, how is that developing? Bracken Darrell I couldn't really give you Asia overall because you got a combination of online-only players and then bricks-and-mortar which are harder to judge. What we can see though is in China for example, our online sales we do know pretty well which is somewhere between 65% and 70% now. In the Americas, we believe it's about 35%. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jorn Iffert with UBS. Jorn Iffert The first one, obvious one, just to read a little bit your fiscal year '18 guidance, I think it's implying no margin improvement. Is there any specific reason for this? Are you planning any, in brackets, one-off investments or are they just a part of nature which of course would be absolutely reasonable? And second question would be on your design to cost program, I think last time when you updated us, you have reviewed around 20% of your products. Where do we stand here right now and when do you expect us to finish and what are roughly the proceeds coming out of this in terms of dollars? And last question would be strategic nature. Would you consider or is this part of your strategic thinking to enter into advanced via partnerships with Amazon or Google for example, not us in the OEM supplier but just as a branded peripheral partner? Vincent Pilette Jorn, let me take first one and Bracken will take the two. And so when you talk about guidance, so on, we've built a reputation on delivering a plan that we have high confidence in and delivering on what we say. Early March when we gave our guidance for the full year here FY '18, we measure all the risk and the opportunities and developed a strong operational plan, by category, by region, investments and returns expected. I'm very glad that we finished Q4 here slightly better than expected. I think it's a very good sign as we start the year, but we still have full year to deliver this guidance. So I don't think at this point in time it would make any sense to adjust our guidance. If we see revenue upside in the year, we may still make the decision to accelerate some investments for better FY '19 and of course will dynamically both manage the business and update the investors on what we're doing here. Bracken Darrell On your question on design for cost, in the description you used a 20% of the kind of ballpark number. What I would say is overall our current game plan is we want to take the concept of design cost into everything. We're doing it over time. We're doing it very systematically. It's actually showing up in our new products now. So you saw some this year. As you said, 20% is not a bad number. You could probably guess it's going to be about the same kind of number or even larger next year. And then over time all our products will be more design per cost. We will always have cost taken opportunities every launch product. But one of the things that we measure now, we look very carefully at what's the if a product is replacing other product, are we doing it equal or better gross margin. And that is a reversal from what you would have seen 5 years ago when we launched at lower gross margins and then falling back over time. On your question on would we consider or is there an option to do partnerships with some kind of other players out there, you remember the nature of our business from its very kind of beginning with is to create products that work with other people's products. We're a peripheral player and we've been a peripheral player and will probably in some ways in most of our categories be a peripheral player. Now we're already doing things in that space consistent with the question we had earlier about Harmony and Harmony is now integrated with both Alexa and Google Home. And we're always looking for opportunities to peripheralize other products with existing ones or new ones. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Andreas Muller with ZKB. Andreas Muller Question, can you be a bit specific more on the gross margin? What were the main drivers behind this increase sequentially even I mean it was very good? Vincent Pilette Yes, so I can definitely do that. So it's definitely an operational performance, if you want. There is no big one-timers in that margin. Similar to what we described in March and similar to what we delivered this year, the single biggest contributor of this gross margin improvement this year is the improvement of the cost structure combined with our ability to hold price value we deliver to consumer. And I think that contributes it to even more gross profit. With that we then in turn re-invest to a simulated growth at the point of sales. Andreas Muller And then what was the main factor behind this huge growth at video collaboration? I mean was it pure -- was it also pure sell-through or was it coming from the expansion of some channels? And how do you see the growth going forward? I know that you see all these bit small conference rooms, but this 73% going forward, of course, that's probably not really a sustainable figure out, but for this year at least can you indicate what you see there? Bracken Darrell Well, I wouldn't look at 70% Q4 as the number to expect for next year. Yes, we grew 42% this year and I think well, that's the kind of growth we've seen -- on average we saw in the first 3 quarters. That said, I take us out of the quarter or even out of the year. What's the driver of the overall growth, it's the fact that honestly I continue to walk in every day into small, medium and some big companies and I'm amazed that how many small, medium and even large conference rooms are not video enabled yet. I would say the vast minority are and so there is just a very large long term opportunity for very affordable video enabled conference rooms and we intend to be in as many as we possibly can be. So no, I don't think you can expect 70% all year long this year, but we expect to have strong growth. Vincent Pilette If I can just add, so we had guided the year at around 40% and we delivered, as Bracken said, 42%. Now if you remember, but Q1 voice sales was actually weaker and you had our -- some of you had the reverse questions and then we said this is not a business that deliver the same gross rate every quarter, right. We commit to develop our sales engagement with various accounts and businesses and we see a very strong long term structural growth. The sales cycle is a bit more aligned to a B2B sales cycles which is slightly different than the core retail. Andreas Muller And my last question on the pointing device category and more specifically the Spotlight, I mean what's the opportunity? I mean could that be kind of substantial within the category like 10%, 20% or really be kind of just a small product within a huge category going forward? Bracken Darrell It's too early for us to say. What I can say with a lot of conviction is we've created a breakthrough in that category that anybody who presents will prefer what we just offered to anything that's ever been made before. What I can tell you is how broadly that will spread across the people who do presentations. And so our mission right now is to get that in as many people's hands as possible to sample it. And the minute you present like I did today here in Zurich, you've got a room full of people who see it for the first time what could be done with the Spotlight compared with anything they ever saw before. Now how fast it will happen, I don't know. We just announced our partnership with TED which is the most important, in a way, of public speaking operation in the world. And so we're trying to make sure we get Spotlight into as many people's hands as possible, so that audience, those audiences of few, self-potential speakers are seeing it in action. And so we'll see and we'll give you an update through the year on how we're proceeding, but we're very optimistic. Thirdly, if you think about it -- I don't want to overstate this, if you think about how many people presenting and how few people own a clicker in quotation marks, there is a big opportunity out there. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Felix Remmers with Credit Suisse. Felix Remmers Three questions from my side actually. One on PC gaming, maybe here an update on the competitive situation. I read that, for example, Lenovo wants to open a 100 stores in Asia devoted to PC gaming. I think they have a collaboration with Razer. You have other companies talking about bullish about PC gaming. Have you seen experienced any increased competition in that market so that would be of interest? And then maybe an update on market share in your PC peripherals business. I mean, I'm always surprised how fast you are growing particular in keyboards. I understand this is also related to market share gains, but how big is still this market share gain opportunity? And maybe lastly on Jaybird, it's a bit difficult to forecast that for us, but given that's in the audio PC and variables category, but the category as a whole, do you foresee growth in this year in that category? Bracken Darrell Yes. So I'll take all three of those. Vincent, you can jump in as you like. For our PC gaming standpoint, is the competition tough? It's always been tough. Is there more -- are there more people entering? Yes, because it's a super high growth category. Do we love our position today? Absolutely. We founded and delivered. The key tools in that category are mouse and keyboard and that's out today. So we love that spot. And one of the reasons why a lot of activity is in Asia is Asia is just on fire from a PC gaming standpoint, for us and our competitors. So yes, I feel good where we're. It will absolutely be competitive and that's probably not at all bad, it's helping drive growth in the category. From a market share standpoint in PC peripherals, here we're -- and you mentioned keyboards in particular, we're systematically growing market share. It depends on what you see around the world. We have grown market share in keyboards and we're going to keep innovating there. Finally, Jaybird, the category of wireless earphones is growing. It's growing rapidly and so we expect that that category will continue to grow and we're going to keep innovating it. Felix Remmers But for the full category report in audio PC and variables, is there a growth? Is that feasible given that the traditional PC speakers are more still under pressure I guess, no? Vincent Pilette Felix, the answer is yes. We obviously done that per every category. We said in the overall music business next year we expect a gross of 10% to 15% and both categories should drive positive growth. Operator [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JP Morgan. Paul Coster So on keyboards and desktops, can you give us more insight into how this business accelerated double digits after growing low single digits in both '15 and '16? What have been the drivers there and what do you expect for '18? Bracken Darrell Sure. Yes, I think at the end of the day, we're just innovating very well there to be honest. The category is still absolutely live and well. And we've gone to multi-device -- first we went to a living room keyboard, then we did multi-device, we launched more multi-device keyboards this year. Our best top-of-the-line keyboard is a multi-device keyboard with a cradle in and that has had just a lot of appeal. So we have -- the market for keyboard has just done fairly okay and we have grown share within it. I think that's really just what's driven the acceleration. So looking out into '18, it's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen with PC category. We tend to be more consistent, more conservative in our PC peripherals planning and therefore it puts pressure on us to make sure growing our new engines to grow faster. But you know, I think the PC peripherals category will be okay in 2018. Paul Coster Okay, great. And then going back to video collaboration, what has been your go-to-market strategy there? And how do you think about sizing this opportunity or what do you think is the TAM? And also what's the competitive landscape in this space in your respective market share? Bracken Darrell Well, it's really hard to come up with a TAM that you could find reliable because it depends on how you think about it. It's really a new category. And so we size it a hundred different ways. What I would just say is forget the TAM. If you look at our existing growth rate, we should be able to sustain that and it's a very, very big operation. The drills for market range -- we've come up with anywhere from $20 billion to $40 billion and those numbers are so big honestly that it's a little hard to believe them. So I think at the end of the day, it's a big market and there are lot of rooms that are not video enabled and we really do believe that over the next 5 to 10 years, most will be video enabled; over 20 years, probably all will be video enabled. That's a big opportunity. Paul Coster Who do you think your main competitors are there? Bracken Darrell It's interesting. There are couple of ways to look at the where essentially I think the biggest competitor is really the chair in the room. So if you have a room with 6 chairs in it, with the cost of 1 or 2 of those chairs you can video enable the room. And today most people are running facilities or even the CIOs are not thinking like that. Once that's put in front of them, they kind of scratch their heads especially when they're creating an open office environment outside and think gosh, this is a huge opportunity. And then the question is which video approach do I use, they start to look at costing and pricing and it takes time. So I think the biggest competitor we have is just the inertia of the reality that video is not yet in the rooms, but it will come. Operator Thank you and it appears there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Darrell for closing remarks. Bracken Darrell I'll just close quickly by saying thanks a lot for hanging with us through -- those of you who have -- most of you have through the last year and certainly through the last 5 years that I have been here. We're really proud of the results and it's been an exciting ride. I always smile when I read or hear somebody say we're priced to perfection or boy, we're executing nearly perfectly because if you sat inside, you'd see how many of just an amazing number of opportunities we have, both operationally and from a growth standpoint that we're not yet getting at it. So we're really excited about the future. We have so many opportunities ahead of us. I hope each of you will be on for these calls for the next 5 years. And thank you. Vincent Pilette Thank you.

At this point in time, we plan to use the incremental gross margin dollars if they come through to invest and build even at a more accelerated gross rate. So our focus really is on capturing the gross opportunities. Now with that said, we have a long term range of operating profit of 10% to 12% on the bottom line and we're just at the midpoint, starting of the midpoint 10.8%, 10.9% and so you will see a constant expansion of that operating profit margin as we continue to build our business. Bracken Darrell And on your Harmony question, I think -- I'd say we're guardedly optimistic. The performance over the last couple of quarters been really strong as we have activated through Amazon Echo and now Google Home. And I think, there are a couple of interesting facts about that, one is that about half of the users that come in are new users who are using -- based on what we can see from activation. So it makes you optimistic that this is an interesting one. And the other thing is we haven't seen a significant fall off after the first announcement, the first letter that went out from Amazon Echo for example or for Amazon on the integration. So, we'll see. We're not going to make any strong commitments on that, but we're optimistic and it's exciting to see. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Foeth with Vontobel. Michael Foeth One question regarding your -- the sell-in and sell-through dynamics in particular in EMEA where sell-in was low and sell-through was high and then in the Americas we had the opposite. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more explanation of what is going on there and how we should see that in the coming quarter? Vincent Pilette Yes, let me answer that first Michael. So, okay, before we talk about it region wide, so sell-in was around 15% U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currency. Sell-through is around 14% in dollar, so overall globally pretty stable. When you look at weeks on hand, whether it's backward looking or forward looking, you'd see them flat or slightly improving. So we feel really good about position overall in our inventory, somewhere in the midpoint of our target range and very stable to slightly improving year-over-year. So feel good on that one. When you look at by region, I don't know if you remember last year Q4 in Americas was exactly the reverse which was low sell-in, high sell-through and then this year we have in the EMEA that position. We have -- usually it's a dynamic management of our overall distribution footprint if you want and nothing specific at this point in time. Overall if you look at EMEA full year, sell-in is around 18% and we exit the year with sell-through at the rate of 19%, so nothing special at this point in time. Michael Foeth Okay. And may be just to follow on the high growth in the Americas, was that Jaybird or anything else? Vincent Pilette No, no. It's a function of, again, the compare. So at last year, sale in Americas was minus 8% on a positive DCS and therefore now of course you have the 5 that you compare against that very low. If you look at the trend on the growth rate in Americas, we've been trending at the high single digit, low double digit except Q4 '16 where we voluntarily were cautious on mobile speakers and the overall sale in Americas was minus 8%. So now of course a year later you compare against that. Michael Foeth And then just may be one last one on your distribution. Can you give us the development of the portion of online sales in Asia versus Americas, how is that developing? Bracken Darrell I couldn't really give you Asia overall because you got a combination of online-only players and then bricks-and-mortar which are harder to judge. What we can see though is in China for example, our online sales we do know pretty well which is somewhere between 65% and 70% now. In the Americas, we believe it's about 35%. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jorn Iffert with UBS. Jorn Iffert The first one, obvious one, just to read a little bit your fiscal year '18 guidance, I think it's implying no margin improvement. Is there any specific reason for this? Are you planning any, in brackets, one-off investments or are they just a part of nature which of course would be absolutely reasonable? And second question would be on your design to cost program, I think last time when you updated us, you have reviewed around 20% of your products. Where do we stand here right now and when do you expect us to finish and what are roughly the proceeds coming out of this in terms of dollars? And last question would be strategic nature. Would you consider or is this part of your strategic thinking to enter into advanced via partnerships with Amazon or Google for example, not us in the OEM supplier but just as a branded peripheral partner? Vincent Pilette Jorn, let me take first one and Bracken will take the two. And so when you talk about guidance, so on, we've built a reputation on delivering a plan that we have high confidence in and delivering on what we say. Early March when we gave our guidance for the full year here FY '18, we measure all the risk and the opportunities and developed a strong operational plan, by category, by region, investments and returns expected. I'm very glad that we finished Q4 here slightly better than expected. I think it's a very good sign as we start the year, but we still have full year to deliver this guidance. So I don't think at this point in time it would make any sense to adjust our guidance. If we see revenue upside in the year, we may still make the decision to accelerate some investments for better FY '19 and of course will dynamically both manage the business and update the investors on what we're doing here. Bracken Darrell On your question on design for cost, in the description you used a 20% of the kind of ballpark number. What I would say is overall our current game plan is we want to take the concept of design cost into everything. We're doing it over time. We're doing it very systematically. It's actually showing up in our new products now. So you saw some this year. As you said, 20% is not a bad number. You could probably guess it's going to be about the same kind of number or even larger next year. And then over time all our products will be more design per cost. We will always have cost taken opportunities every launch product. But one of the things that we measure now, we look very carefully at what's the if a product is replacing other product, are we doing it equal or better gross margin. And that is a reversal from what you would have seen 5 years ago when we launched at lower gross margins and then falling back over time. On your question on would we consider or is there an option to do partnerships with some kind of other players out there, you remember the nature of our business from its very kind of beginning with is to create products that work with other people's products. We're a peripheral player and we've been a peripheral player and will probably in some ways in most of our categories be a peripheral player. Now we're already doing things in that space consistent with the question we had earlier about Harmony and Harmony is now integrated with both Alexa and Google Home. And we're always looking for opportunities to peripheralize other products with existing ones or new ones. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Andreas Muller with ZKB. Andreas Muller Question, can you be a bit specific more on the gross margin? What were the main drivers behind this increase sequentially even I mean it was very good? Vincent Pilette Yes, so I can definitely do that. So it's definitely an operational performance, if you want. There is no big one-timers in that margin. Similar to what we described in March and similar to what we delivered this year, the single biggest contributor of this gross margin improvement this year is the improvement of the cost structure combined with our ability to hold price value we deliver to consumer. And I think that contributes it to even more gross profit. With that we then in turn re-invest to a simulated growth at the point of sales. Andreas Muller And then what was the main factor behind this huge growth at video collaboration? I mean was it pure -- was it also pure sell-through or was it coming from the expansion of some channels? And how do you see the growth going forward? I know that you see all these bit small conference rooms, but this 73% going forward, of course, that's probably not really a sustainable figure out, but for this year at least can you indicate what you see there? Bracken Darrell Well, I wouldn't look at 70% Q4 as the number to expect for next year. Yes, we grew 42% this year and I think well, that's the kind of growth we've seen -- on average we saw in the first 3 quarters. That said, I take us out of the quarter or even out of the year. What's the driver of the overall growth, it's the fact that honestly I continue to walk in every day into small, medium and some big companies and I'm amazed that how many small, medium and even large conference rooms are not video enabled yet. I would say the vast minority are and so there is just a very large long term opportunity for very affordable video enabled conference rooms and we intend to be in as many as we possibly can be. So no, I don't think you can expect 70% all year long this year, but we expect to have strong growth. Vincent Pilette If I can just add, so we had guided the year at around 40% and we delivered, as Bracken said, 42%. Now if you remember, but Q1 voice sales was actually weaker and you had our -- some of you had the reverse questions and then we said this is not a business that deliver the same gross rate every quarter, right. We commit to develop our sales engagement with various accounts and businesses and we see a very strong long term structural growth. The sales cycle is a bit more aligned to a B2B sales cycles which is slightly different than the core retail. Andreas Muller And my last question on the pointing device category and more specifically the Spotlight, I mean what's the opportunity? I mean could that be kind of substantial within the category like 10%, 20% or really be kind of just a small product within a huge category going forward? Bracken Darrell It's too early for us to say. What I can say with a lot of conviction is we've created a breakthrough in that category that anybody who presents will prefer what we just offered to anything that's ever been made before. What I can tell you is how broadly that will spread across the people who do presentations. And so our mission right now is to get that in as many people's hands as possible to sample it. And the minute you present like I did today here in Zurich, you've got a room full of people who see it for the first time what could be done with the Spotlight compared with anything they ever saw before. Now how fast it will happen, I don't know. We just announced our partnership with TED which is the most important, in a way, of public speaking operation in the world. And so we're trying to make sure we get Spotlight into as many people's hands as possible, so that audience, those audiences of few, self-potential speakers are seeing it in action. And so we'll see and we'll give you an update through the year on how we're proceeding, but we're very optimistic. Thirdly, if you think about it -- I don't want to overstate this, if you think about how many people presenting and how few people own a clicker in quotation marks, there is a big opportunity out there. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Felix Remmers with Credit Suisse. Felix Remmers Three questions from my side actually. One on PC gaming, maybe here an update on the competitive situation. I read that, for example, Lenovo wants to open a 100 stores in Asia devoted to PC gaming. I think they have a collaboration with Razer. You have other companies talking about bullish about PC gaming. Have you seen experienced any increased competition in that market so that would be of interest? And then maybe an update on market share in your PC peripherals business. I mean, I'm always surprised how fast you are growing particular in keyboards. I understand this is also related to market share gains, but how big is still this market share gain opportunity? And maybe lastly on Jaybird, it's a bit difficult to forecast that for us, but given that's in the audio PC and variables category, but the category as a whole, do you foresee growth in this year in that category? Bracken Darrell Yes. So I'll take all three of those. Vincent, you can jump in as you like. For our PC gaming standpoint, is the competition tough? It's always been tough. Is there more -- are there more people entering? Yes, because it's a super high growth category. Do we love our position today? Absolutely. We founded and delivered. The key tools in that category are mouse and keyboard and that's out today. So we love that spot. And one of the reasons why a lot of activity is in Asia is Asia is just on fire from a PC gaming standpoint, for us and our competitors. So yes, I feel good where we're. It will absolutely be competitive and that's probably not at all bad, it's helping drive growth in the category. From a market share standpoint in PC peripherals, here we're -- and you mentioned keyboards in particular, we're systematically growing market share. It depends on what you see around the world. We have grown market share in keyboards and we're going to keep innovating there. Finally, Jaybird, the category of wireless earphones is growing. It's growing rapidly and so we expect that that category will continue to grow and we're going to keep innovating it. Felix Remmers But for the full category report in audio PC and variables, is there a growth? Is that feasible given that the traditional PC speakers are more still under pressure I guess, no? Vincent Pilette Felix, the answer is yes. We obviously done that per every category. We said in the overall music business next year we expect a gross of 10% to 15% and both categories should drive positive growth. Operator [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JP Morgan. Paul Coster So on keyboards and desktops, can you give us more insight into how this business accelerated double digits after growing low single digits in both '15 and '16? What have been the drivers there and what do you expect for '18? Bracken Darrell Sure. Yes, I think at the end of the day, we're just innovating very well there to be honest. The category is still absolutely live and well. And we've gone to multi-device -- first we went to a living room keyboard, then we did multi-device, we launched more multi-device keyboards this year. Our best top-of-the-line keyboard is a multi-device keyboard with a cradle in and that has had just a lot of appeal. So we have -- the market for keyboard has just done fairly okay and we have grown share within it. I think that's really just what's driven the acceleration. So looking out into '18, it's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen with PC category. We tend to be more consistent, more conservative in our PC peripherals planning and therefore it puts pressure on us to make sure growing our new engines to grow faster. But you know, I think the PC peripherals category will be okay in 2018. Paul Coster Okay, great. And then going back to video collaboration, what has been your go-to-market strategy there? And how do you think about sizing this opportunity or what do you think is the TAM? And also what's the competitive landscape in this space in your respective market share? Bracken Darrell Well, it's really hard to come up with a TAM that you could find reliable because it depends on how you think about it. It's really a new category. And so we size it a hundred different ways. What I would just say is forget the TAM. If you look at our existing growth rate, we should be able to sustain that and it's a very, very big operation. The drills for market range -- we've come up with anywhere from $20 billion to $40 billion and those numbers are so big honestly that it's a little hard to believe them. So I think at the end of the day, it's a big market and there are lot of rooms that are not video enabled and we really do believe that over the next 5 to 10 years, most will be video enabled; over 20 years, probably all will be video enabled. That's a big opportunity. Paul Coster Who do you think your main competitors are there? Bracken Darrell It's interesting. There are couple of ways to look at the where essentially I think the biggest competitor is really the chair in the room. So if you have a room with 6 chairs in it, with the cost of 1 or 2 of those chairs you can video enable the room. And today most people are running facilities or even the CIOs are not thinking like that. Once that's put in front of them, they kind of scratch their heads especially when they're creating an open office environment outside and think gosh, this is a huge opportunity. And then the question is which video approach do I use, they start to look at costing and pricing and it takes time. So I think the biggest competitor we have is just the inertia of the reality that video is not yet in the rooms, but it will come. Operator Thank you and it appears there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Darrell for closing remarks. Bracken Darrell I'll just close quickly by saying thanks a lot for hanging with us through -- those of you who have -- most of you have through the last year and certainly through the last 5 years that I have been here. We're really proud of the results and it's been an exciting ride. I always smile when I read or hear somebody say we're priced to perfection or boy, we're executing nearly perfectly because if you sat inside, you'd see how many of just an amazing number of opportunities we have, both operationally and from a growth standpoint that we're not yet getting at it. So we're really excited about the future. We have so many opportunities ahead of us. I hope each of you will be on for these calls for the next 5 years. And thank you. Vincent Pilette Thank you.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Satya Kumar. Please go ahead, sir. Satya Kumar Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During todays call, we will share our outlook on the business environment, review our financial results for the March 2017 quarter, and our outlook for the June 2017 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 PM Pacific Time this afternoon. It can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the Companys website along with the presentation slides that accompany todays call. Todays presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slide in the presentation for additional information. Todays discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in todays earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 PM Pacific Time. And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up, so we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that, let me hand the call over to Martin. Martin Anstice Thank you all for joining us today for our March 2017 quarterly earnings call. Stating the obvious, we are extremely pleased with the performance of the company that we reported and guided today. As challenging as it is to scale our company from an average calendar 16 quarterly output level by more than 40% which is the reality of our 2.4 billion recent quarter shipments. It is gratifying to see the results of our collective efforts. Our strategy of the developments of an increasingly critical and enabling products and services portfolio, our consistent execution across all functions of the company and last but not least the tremendous commitment of our employees and partners globally are all necessary components of a multi-year outperformance story. It is a privilege to lead this company and on behalf of the entire management team I would like to thank everybody that contributed, the very same people that are creating as we speak the next world of opportunity in our future. We delivered record financial results once again in the March quarter, with shipments and revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and non-GAAP EPS above the high-end of our guidance range. For all the reasons previously communicated and reinforced by our actual performance currently, we believe LAM is in an excellent position with our leadership and competency in etch, deposition, and clean product conservative to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing for many years to come. Turning to the broader industry environment, as stated already the momentum of investment levels in the segments that we participate is net positive. Capacity addition and technology conversion trends appear rational and strategic, both elements leading to a strengthened outlook for the calendar year. Since our last earnings call, expectations for the year have improved. We are now guiding a first half shipment stronger than previously anticipated, with a second half now slightly more balanced than the no better than 55/45 reference of the last earnings call and the optimism that we have for sustainable technology demand trends is further strengthened by well publicized plans throughout the electronics ecosystem. In short, silicon continues to sit at the very center of long-term electronics technology and applications innovation. That is the fundamental opportunity for our industry and specifically for Lam Research. Market trends and our initial modeling indicates continued strength of WFE in 2018 also. Memory company cash flows, memory unit pricing and the implied commentary on supply and demand balance are broadly well analyzed and reported at this point. We have no incremental perspective to share at this time. Demand continues to be strong for NAND in the SSD and embedded markets driving increased spending activity for NAND in 2017. We expect total 3D NAND shipped capacity at year-end to represent slightly more than the 50% of the installed base with a balance of Greenfield and conversion investments this year. In DRAM, we continue to anticipate double-digit growth in equipment spending in calendar 17 year-over-year, with investments being dominated by technology conversion. We now model a modest growth in foundry and logic spending combined as leading edge devices increasingly meet performance targets and adoption criteria for the broad range of advanced computation market needs. These additional investments are focused primarily at the 10-nanomter technology node this year. Overall, we believe calendar 17 wafer fabrication equipment spending and to a greater extent our SAM and our own business levels are all tracking positively against previously stated expectation. The intended headlines today for the company are clear we hope. We continue to invest in the positioning of enabling technology, products and services with benchmark level R&D funding approaching two thirds of our overall operating expenses in support of our customers plans and to build sustainable value for Lam Research. We are actively working to enhance the competitive differentiation momentum of five years of profitable growth averaging an 18% revenue CAGR, with calendar 17 expected to be our most significant revenue, profit and cash generation growth year yet this decade. With the anticipated business plans of our customers, their equipment selections already made, and the continued operational execution standard of LAM, we have every confidence in our industry outperformance potential long term. We have singular focus on our corporate strategy and vision that we consider compelling for all stakeholders. Specifically, we believe that our intuitive focus on customer trust and a collaborative culture, a flexible business model, and a result to invest strategically in our long term success with a commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders all combine to create a rewarding opportunity. Last but not least, we believe that the secular demand trends and outlook for the world of technology and electronic applications are more compelling than ever with the silicon roadmap and the role of Lam Research front and center. With that let me turn the call over to Doug. Doug Bettinger Thanks Martin. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today for our March 2017 quarterly earnings call. The March quarter represented a solid start to the calendar year. We delivered record levels of shipments, revenue, gross margin dollars, operating income dollars, and earnings per share. Each of these metrics grew double digits quarter over quarter. Financial performance was above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics, with operating margin and earnings per share above the high-end of the range we provided to you last quarter. Shipments for the quarter were strong at $2.413 billion which was up 25% sequentially and again above the midpoint of the guided range. Memory shipments were very strong in the quarter, as customers continued their investments in three 3D NAND capacity. Our customers are investing in new 3D wafers, they're converting planar to 3D and they're also embarking on 3D technology conversions to increase layer count. NAND demand continues to be strong driven by growth in enterprise and client SSDs as well as mobile device density increases. The combined memory segment represented 73% of total system level shipments and that compares with 61% in the prior quarter. Memory shipments were weighted heavily towards - excuse me, the nonvolatile segment which represented 50% of shipments in the March quarter compared with 37% in the prior quarter. DRAM shipments grew 24% sequentially in dollar terms and made up 23% of system shipments. DRAM shipments comprise 24% of system shipments in the December quarter. We're seeing an uptick in DRAM spending in line with improving demand in content growth from areas such as smartphones and servers. DRAM spending is largely focused on conversions with the majority being conversions to the 1x nanometer node. The foundry segment was flattish sequentially in dollar terms accounting for 24% of system shipments. Foundry spending was a combination of leading-edge 10 nanometer capacity, initial 7 nanometer pilot investments as well as continued spending at 28 nanometer and above with the latter being primarily focused in China. And finally the logic and other segment contributed 3% of system shipments. Revenue came in at $2.154 billion in the March quarter, which was up roughly 14% from the December quarter. Gross margin for the period came in 46.1% above the midpoint of our guidance. And as I've shared with you before, our gross margins are a function of a number of factors such as overall business volumes, product mix and customer concentration, so you will see variability quarter to quarter. And I just like to remind you that our financial model is still the best way to think about our ongoing profitability performance. Operating expenses in the quarter grew as we knew they would to $414 million. This compares to $384 million in the December quarter. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue decreased to 19% compared to 20% in the prior quarter. And as Martin pointed out, the majority of our OpEx spending continues to be allocated to funding our critical R&D programs. Operating income in the March quarter came in at $578 million and that compares to $490 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin was 26.9%, above the high end of the guided range. The tax rate for the quarter was 12% compared with 15% last quarter. The tax rate in the March quarter was favorably impacted by the release of tax liabilities from the conclusion of certain tax matters. Additionally, we had a reserve release related to the Novellus acquisition that is included in the GAAP results. The tax rate in the low-to-mid teens for the remainder of 2017 would be reasonable for you to use in your earnings models. Based on our share count of approximately 182 million shares, earnings per share for the March quarter totaled $2.80, above the guided range. This share count includes dilution on a non-GAAP basis from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes, with a total dilutive impact of about 16 million shares. And Ill remind you that dilution schedules for the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. This quarter we returned $213 million to our shareholders, $73 million in dividend distributions and $140 million in share repurchases. We took delivery of 1.2 million shares at an average price of $114.30. Weve completed approximately 20% of our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization and I'll let you know that we plan to initiate a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program in the June quarter. Now let me return to the balance sheet. We continue to have both a solid cash position and healthy cash generation. Cash and short-term investments including restricted cash increased modestly to $6.140 billion at the end of the quarter. Cash from operations was $423 million and that compares to $404 million in December. DSO held steady at 69 days in the March quarter, the same level as in December. Inventory turns were 4.2 which was up slightly from 4.1 in the prior quarter. This turns number is the highest we've achieved since we've combined LAM with Novellus. We exited the quarter with deferred revenues of $842 million, which was up from $673 million in December. This amount excludes $260 million in shipments to customers in Japan which will revenue in future quarters. These Japanese shipments are up from $129 million in the December quarter. And I'll just remind you that these Japanese shipments remain on our balance sheet as inventory carried at cost. And I'll just do the math for you. I'd like to point out that this combined deferred shipment bucket now stands at $1.1 billion and it grew 37% in the March quarter. I expect deferred revenue will grow again in the June quarter. Company noncash expenses for the quarter included the following; $35 million for equity comp, $38 million for amortization and $38 million for the depreciation. Capital expenditures were $44 million which was up from $37 million in the December quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately 8,600 regular full-time employees, which was up about 400 from the end of the December quarter. The increase in headcount was in support of our growing business levels primarily in the operations and field organizations. Additionally, we're bringing on board the talent required to execute on our forward looking R&D programs. Now looking ahead, Id like to provide you our guidance - for non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We're expecting another record shipment of $2.500 billion plus or minus $100 million. Were expecting record revenue of $2.300 billion plus or minus $100 million. Were forecasting gross margin of 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point and we're forecasting operating margins of 27% plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, were forecasting earnings per share of $3, plus or minus $0.12 based on a share count of approximately 180 million shares. We're obviously pleased with our performance this quarter and with the guidance we've just shared for the June quarter. Our business has never been stronger financially and we're continuing to execute extremely well. We're in the right place at the right time with the right products. We're partnering with our customers to enable the transitions happening within the industry today and we're making the investments required to sustain our business long term.  Operator that concludes my prepared remarks, Martin and I would now like open up the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Well take our first question from Stephen Chin with UBS Bank. Stephen Chin My first question is just on your early outlook for the 2018 industry wafer fab equipment spending. Does 2018 appear to be another growth year for WFE because of indigenous China or is it just continued spend by incumbent than in foundry and memory logic? Thanks. Martin Anstice I think if I try to answer that definitively, I'd be a little bit misleading. I think that its still early days but based on the data points that we see today Stephen, we see sustainability in the context of the discipline of capital investments, the relative balance and stability between kind of supply and demand as best we can tell in the industry. And particularly on the last part of your question, the China story, the domestic China story at least we believe it's more of a calendar 18 investment than calendar 17. So really our comments are comments about discipline in capacity additions and what we think are pretty compelling and exciting, and sustainable long-term demand trends. At the end of the day if that plays out as it is more generally described today the investment will follow. Stephen Chin Just a quick follow-up on memory CapEx to sales trends. It sounds like memory fundamentals are healthy and historically we've seen memory industry have a CapEx to sales ratio of 30% to 35%. Do you think that CapEx to sales ratio is still a good sustainable scenario for the market or it's likely that CapEx to sales to go higher in light of the scalability issues with 3D NAND and slowing DRAM transition. Thanks. Martin Anstice Honestly Stephen, I've never been a really big fan of capital intensity ratios because I think it kind of whipsaws us around in terms of the analytics in any one quarter and the reality is the economics of an addition in new capacity is a very different economics than a conversion. We're pretty agnostic in the NAND space to how our customers execute those plans as we've previously described. And in terms of wafer starts, it looks to us like the investments of this year are kind of pretty balanced between Greenfield and conversion. So we look to the sustainability question more in terms of kind of balance of bit growth demand and our understanding of supply additions. And I think kind of the market generally is telling that story. So I don't really have anything to tell you that will cause the future to be very different from the past in terms of that particular metric. Doug Bettinger The only thing Id like to point out Stephen is obviously, you know what memory revenue is likely to be this year, it's super strong, right. And so youve always have to think about affordability and clearly the levels that are going on today are affordable given how strong revenue and memory is. Operator Moving onto to our next question, our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri I guess the first question, Doug is to you. Just looking out into the third calendar quarter, it looks like you guys said a little used words a little more balanced than what the 55/45 was, so maybe it sounds like second half shipments was down something like maybe 10% half on half. So that would sort of say 4.5 million shipments in the back half of the year. So maybe [indiscernible] in the third calendar quarter, is that like roughly the right math. Doug Bettinger Yeah, I mean we're - Tim, as you know we guide one quarter at time, well give you a little bit of color which is what Martin did, when he said a little more balanced than the 55/45 and there's also reason I gave you the deferred revenue number, so you can think about how that likely transpires through the year. I'm not going to guide the third calendar quarter or the fourth, but I think we've given you enough to model it pretty closely. Martin Anstice Maybe just kind of two things to add quickly. I think our outlook today at least would cause us to believe that the December quarter is our weakest shipments quarter of the year, so that's kind of one extra data point. Another one is just kind of plain simple math of the disclosure that we've given, so the sum of our actual performance in our guidance today is the first half shipment of 4.9. You will I'm sure all make their own judgments about how much better the balance is than we previously described, but if you just use the math of 55/45 proxy than the shipments for the year is approximately $8.9 billion and in a ramping year the revenues lack the shipment. So I think those numbers are the ones that we're kind of intending you to embrace. Timothy Arcuri Then I just had a question about the deferred revenue balance, Doug, which you were talking about before. I mean, you guys are now up to about 1.7 months, if I look into June, youre going to have about 1.7 months if you add Japan plus the deferred, you know, the regular balance. And it starts to look a little like the old Lam sort of in terms of backlog, not the new short lead time Lam. Is there a dynamic there, maybe you're shifting more new products or there's something happening in NAND and sort of - can you help us understand what sort of catch-up we should see because obviously you're going to revenue a lot more than youll ship during the back-half of the year. Martin Anstice Yeah, it's pretty simple to think through this Tim, when you've got shipments that are growing the way we have the last several quarters, revenue almost always lags at growth and shipments. When shipments level off or if they were to decline sequentially, revenue will catch up, it's just a natural progression of the timing between with something shows up at the customer's dock and it gets into acceptance and revenue. Doug Bettinger But specifically is your question, Tim, as more kind of headline for us in terms of the timelines for ship to install and therefore acceptance of revenues. In any one quarter and you don't get to see this unfortunately, but the specific scheduling of shipments in any one week or any one day of any one month, I mean, that kind of jerks the ratios around. So there's is no real story here in terms of kind of changing dynamic of timeline. Operator Our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead. Patrick Ho First off, in terms of your comments about a more balanced 2017 between first half and second half, is there any one specific market segment that's driving this better balance or is it a confluence of all the markets you mentioned in your prepared remarks? Martin Anstice Well maybe Ill break that into two parts. So what changed for us between this earnings call and the last earnings call, if you look at kind of the expansion in the business that we've reported and we're anticipating approximately two-thirds of that is in NAND space and a third is in foundry logic. So that would at least tell you that - to the assumptions we made and disclosed previously there's no real headline in terms of DRAM. So that would be the first part of the maybe the most helpful part of answering you question. Maybe I'll stop there, did I get what you wanted? Patrick Ho Yes, actually thats very helpful Martin. And my follow-up question maybe for Doug, in terms of the ramp up of shipments you talked about, you kept your supply chain at really optimal levels with inventory and even AR. What are some of I guess the nuances or the tricks that youre keeping the supply chain as tight and efficient as it's been particularly as shipments continue to ramp up over these last few quarters? Doug Bettinger I mean its continued focus on just managing our remote factories, managing our own internal facilities, anticipating what we were going to need to be able to support at this point months and months ago and communicating that to our supply chain partners, Patrick. I mean it's operational excellence, the way Lam has always executed, just at a different scale here. Martin Anstice And just adding, I would say, honest hard work and when you hear us talk about our customer trust orientation, when you hear us talk about collaborative and partnership orientation that's pretty fundamental relative to sustaining your ability to perform and execute with the level of variability that is part of our business through the consolidation of our customers in the last several years. So our supply chain and our own factory and our field service engineers have done a tremendous job scaling in a very short period of time. And we continue to be proactive as proactive as we can be based on our visibility to ensure that investments are kind of made ahead of the need to support and service our customers. And competitively as best I can tell, we're doing just fine. Operator Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar I have two of them, the first one for Martin. You're NAND shipments are at record high and 3D NAND spending is robust. I'm just curious if the pricing for NAND rolls over, will the reality of economics weaken and the 3D NAND makers might scale back CapEx or do you think the demand is strong enough to continue investing in capacity. Then I have a follow up. Martin Anstice Yeah, I mean I think you know one of our headlines obviously is there's a long way to go with the NAND story. And as I know you understand extremely well the economics of that device architecture are one of the most relevant parts to the penetration of SSDs and so on and so forth. So, I mean there's a positive for every negative. We see a long way to go, we see compelling demand drivers for that architecture and as we've described a number of times particularly in critical applications, the high volume manufacturing position of Lam in that inflection is outstanding. That's the best word that I could use to describe the position that we worked hard to achieve and sustain. So there's a long way to go and best we can tell, commitment to technology and sustainability to investment will go up and down along the way for sure, but long term, it feels pretty good. Krish Sankar Then a follow-up for Doug, Doug you mentioned in your comments that the headcount addition for new product development. Im kind of curious, is this because these new products youre developing, you don't have the core competency within Lam i.e. full wafer deposition or etch-related technologies and is it why you're hiring or am I just reading too much into it. Doug Bettinger Yeah, youre reading too much into Krish. I mean, any time you're doing more this year than you did last year you need more people to execute that, that's the statement around R&D. The biggest area of increase in headcount though Krish is, operations as well as the field who are shipping product real time and installing it at the customers facility. Martin Anstice And maybe just to add to that, let's kind of go back to disclosure of the last earnings call, because there's two stories in the company, one of them is the story of creating a road map of products and technology that was relevant for inflections anticipating how those inflections would have a concentration of spending for etch and deposition particularly. The second part of it was building the competitiveness of the portfolio we have so we get a bigger share of it and we gave two very important headlines in the last earnings call. One of them was the statement about how our foundry business grows and we characterized the growth in our foundry business year-over-year 16, 15 of 40% compared to a 25% WFE reference and we also stated that in NAND, we grow shipments by 80% year-over-year almost twice as the rate of WFE growth. So the headcount of the company is a lifecycle statement. So you add headcount when you prepare to do that and you add headcounts when you're in the middle of doing it and to some extent through the lifetime in an installed base business, the tail will demand at certain points, adding additional headcounts for many years to come and that's a natural commentary on the evolution of the company. Krish Sankar Got you. Thats very helpful. Thanks guys and great execution. Operator And well move on to our next question. Our next question comes from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Farhan Ahmad Thanks for taking my question. I had a question in terms of the sustainability. The year on year growth that youve seen is quite impressive in the first half of this year. Now if I look back more recently since maybe 2010, the cyclicality of the business has gone down and that also implies that like year on year comparisons have not been that fair. So the fact that you're having too much growth right now, is that a concern in your mind in anyway and should that bring concerns of cyclicality back into the industry. Martin Anstice Yeah. In my opinion, no. I mean I might be wrong, but I think that there has been a fundamental transition in the industry as the supply chain is matured and as there's been concentration in the semiconductor industry. The traditional history of the industry was an over investment for many players and then a contraction. I think that's kind of long gone by virtue of scale and scope of the economics of the industry and the technical risks and opportunities to kind of go with it. But what is always still true is it's still difficult to predict and maybe increasingly so because there is no one kind of killer app or killer devices that diverse the demand drivers. Its more difficult to predict for our customers and therefore for us. There is some variability of spending and one element of our focus on competitive differentiation is business model flexibility and its not actually that easy to ramp the capacity of your company by 40% to an average baseline of prior year. I mean that's a lot of hard work. The variability and flexible business model is a critical part of the success of the company and hopefully that will be a long term statement of value for our shareholders. Farhan Ahmad Thanks, Martin. And then one question on China. There's a lot of expectation around memory investment in China next year. The question I have for you is that from your perspective, has the visibility of memory projects changed for China for next and is that a part that you see for China memory investments next year without some foreign IP coming in to the picture. Martin Anstice Yeah. I think I'd probably say the same thing today that I've said for a while now and there clearly seems to be conviction to a plan that looks rational in terms of its kind of fundamental business objectives and your ability to execute as a byproduct of two things, knowing how to make the devices you want to sell and then having the operational scale to pull it off and whether that comes from M&A or IP licensing or just the developments of organic know how, I think we will see over time as best we can tell, we still believe that the China memory investment conversation is more a calendar 18 story than calendar 17 story and just to give you a little bit more color on the calendar 18 kind of holistically, we're tracking about 10 new fabs next year and to our understanding of the investment plans in those fabs, more than 80% of the wafer start additions will be not in China. So that's another data point that hopefully allows you to triangulate a little more. Operator Well take our next question from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, on the fact youve talked about service running at around 20% of revenues. As you clearly increased your installed base over the last couple of years, curious, has that increased and/or when could we see an acceleration for that part of your business? Martin Anstice Well, I think whether its accelerating enough, I'll let you decide. But at least for the last couple of years, we've had a pretty intense focus on broadening our work I would say to a customer. So advanced services agenda and a creative use of software, really employing strategies around machine learning and harnessing the data from the information that's available to us and to our customers in ways that create value, whether its productivity oriented or extendibility oriented, there's a number of very meaningful projects. The business has been growing faster than the pace of the installed base and it continues to do so this year. And I would say we would expect the momentum in kind of the 18 to be stronger than 17 on that point. But it takes some time right and you develop new products and services, there's no magic depending on swing. It takes a number of years to really demonstrate and deliver the value and have the customer convicted that transition makes sense for them. C.J. Muse Very helpful. And just as a follow up, when you think about the back half and I'm not asking for shipment guide, but as you think about mix and I think the takeaway from some of your comments earlier is that deferred revenues should help revenues exchange shipment from Q4. Curious how we should be thinking about gross margin trajectory in the second half? Doug Bettinger C.J., the guidance I gave you as you think to margin percentages, even though were maybe not exactly on the financial model, we provided to you the margin percentages in the financial model are still good guideposts if you will in terms of how to model our business. So Id encourage you to go back and have a look at what we shared with you in November there. Operator Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur Good afternoon and solid job on the quarterly execution. On your view on better foundry and logic spend, of that incremental spending improvement, does it include a bottoming out of the number of customers relative to your prior view and is the incremental spend more leading edge 10 and 7 or more follow through on legacy 28 nanometer. Martin Anstice Most of the increment was ten at least compared and contrasted with our comments of the last earnings call and I don't know that our expectations for broadening are any different today than they were then. We expected there to be a number of customers making those investments and it's kind of playing out that way. Maybe one of the things I could have actually added earlier and maybe Ill do it now, Harlan, is when we look at our first half, second half, we believe that the first half memory is stronger than the second half memory from a shipments point of view and logic foundry is stronger second half than first half. So that's our view of kind of wafer fabrication equipment spending balance in the first half, second half by segment. Harlan Sur Thanks for the insights there, Martin. And then on the strong memory shipment environment, what we're hearing probably the same thing you guys are is that DRAM and NAND suppliers are kind of hand to mouth right, in other words, the shipping whatever they can build even always in the seasonally weaker March quarter, so I guess my question is, are you sensing more urgency to drive accelerated node migrations Whether that 1X for DRAM or 64 layers for NAND, Im just wondering if we're going to see a step up in node migration cadence just given the industry supply constraints. Martin Anstice Interesting question. I don't know if I would articulate a cadence message. I mean clearly there's a commitment to technology in conversions in memory and DRAM this year and that was a big part of the increments year-over-year from a spending and overall performance of the company. But I still don't think we're modeling any more than 25% of the installed base at the 1X node by the end of this year. So thats a reference there and maybe there's a statement on cadence, but there's clearly momentum and ambition to 64 layer devices. But if you look at the installed base of 3D NAND capacity at the end of this year, there's still a pretty broad mix of 3D capacity, right. So not only is there the reality that approximately half of the NAND installed base is 3D capable, there is the dynamic that some proportion of that 3D capable device is 32 player device capable, some proportion is 48 and some proportion is 64. So there's a long way to go with the installed base and supply chain, independent of the demand story. Operator Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a few questions. First is, there are some concerns that the second derivative of the 3D NAND wafer additions has peaked. Clearly, you had opportunity to gain share going from 2D to 3D, as you address the biggest portion of the market, but let's say the number of 3D NAND wafer addition next year is exactly the same as this year in 2018. How should we think about your revenue opportunity to NAND and technology or help you do better than what you did this year. Martin Anstice I have no idea. I mean its such a precise question with due respect. I mean, the complexity of the customers roadmap and spending, there are so many moving parts on that. I mean the best I can give you is that you got to take your own position on how much legitimate demand there is for 3D nonvolatile memory. We're pretty optimistic, but you make your own call on that. Whatever the level of demand that there is, Lam Research is going to perform better than the average equipment company maybe by a long way and that's the message we've tried to convey in terms of the criticality of etch and deposition in the device manufacturing process flow and it's the message that we try to articulate relative to critical applications, market share etch and dep at the 90% level. And it's the message that we've tried to articulate in terms of market share generally from plaintiffs to 3D which is almost a double digit gain in market share. So whatever it is, Lam Research is going to be a company in the mix of equipment companies that will be on the kind of upper end of the scale of performance as long as we keep executing in the ways that we have demonstrated in the last several years. I apologize I cant answer directly your question, but hopefully that context is helpful. Sidney Ho That's super helpful. Maybe switching to foundry and logic, in the past, you talked about yours and maybe in the dep etch clean opportunity goes up a lot every node, I think just comment on your share gains in this segment, but at the same time, TSMC, again, this is probably not new, but last week, they talked about the capital intensity probably stayed within pretty stable range over next few years. Can you help us square those comments and when its going up a lot and when its kind of flattish? Martin Anstice Yeah. I mean, obviously, the comments from any one customer are going to be WFE comments and the comments have come from the company, from us or segment specific, right. So our story is generally as you articulated in the microprocessor space. I think we've conveyed now for a couple of years a very different reality of engagement with the customer than was true five years ago and as I already noted again by repeating the disclosure of the last earnings call, our market share momentum in foundry has also been positive through the 10 nanometer and 7 nanometer transitions and all of that is true and supplemented by the fact that through the 10 and 7 and 5 nanometer technology roadmap, the proportion of SAM in etch and deposition systematically increases with the adoption of EUV thats I would say the consensus adoption assumptions and that's really a commentary on the progress that's been made in the economics of multi-patterning and it's a commentary on the insertion of EUR with a multi-patterning process flow and it's a commentary on probably 70% of multi-patterning integration schemes being spacer based. So there's a lot of kind of moving parts, but pretty positive story I think independent of the overarching statement that you've made and maybe one last point, logic and foundry are as invested as ever if not more so in utilizing their installed base and that will continue to be true for all of our customers. Operator The next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. Martin, I had a question on 2018. I realize we're early here, but  Martin Anstice We lost you. Satya Kumar Operator, are you there? Operator I am. We will move on to our next question. The next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Atif Malik Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on good result and guide. Martin, you were a keynote speaker at SEMICON China in March, I Just wanted to know if you're confident in domestic Chinese spending based on discussions in China is higher about the same than what was three months ago. Martin Anstice It's about the same and I would say as a context, I'm a keynote speaker in SEMICON conferences all around the world. So I don't read too much into, I happened to show up in China. So we continue to believe there's substance to their ambition. We continue to believe they're working really hard and as is true for our customers globally, our job is to support as best we can and that's true for every customer wherever they are. Atif Malik Great. And then as a follow up, can you talk about the image sensor market? In your 37 billion plus WFE outlook, how big is the image sensor opportunity and what are the trends you're seeing in that market this year? Martin Anstice Yeah. I don't know Atif that we've quantified it specifically and I don't think we're going to today. What I would tell you directionally relative to last year is its stronger this year than it was last year, probably not as strong as it was the year before, but we're seeing nice momentum in image sensor and it's a very etch and deposition intensive process and our position is strong. Our share position is very strong.  Operator Well move on to our next question. Our next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead. Weston Twigg Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, just wanted to ask about DRAM. You said your outlook hasn't changed much for this year yet, but I'm just wondering as you look out in to 2018, big growth is pretty hard to come by, are you expecting some of that positive view on 2018 to come from DRAM capacity expansion in fabs? Martin Anstice We're not assuming much of anything in terms of increased wafer stocks I would say in DRAM just as a general modeling statement and I'd say that for 18 as much as they would 17 and maybe even 20. I mean I think our long term model is basically kind of flat lined wafer stocks in DRAM. The spending is all about technology conversion. Generally speaking, the demand statement is all about content more than units of any one device and there are some really interesting kind of demand opportunities for our customers and clearly there are some rumors I would say at various points in time around speculating of increased investments if and when our customers start articulating that, then obviously we're well positioned than we would participate naturally in that as strongly as we have in our past. Weston Twigg Okay. That's helpful. And then secondarily, just looking ahead on 3D NAND scaling, youve talked about having good positions through 64 layer and trying to get good positioning for the 96 layer process, but just wondering if you're seeing a continued push for increased layer height from customers or if theyre finding the scaling challenges are limiting then, you'll see them sort of double up on string stacking doublings layers of 64 or 48 for example. Martin Anstice Yeah. I mean I think the industry is at a still and customers specifically are still working through the answers to those questions. From a traditional scaling point of view, vertical scaling point of view, I mean we have customer engagements that extend beyond the 96 layer. So were actively working with customers of that layer count in its element environment and as is true, if a customer can continue the same integration scheme and same equipment selection and the same materials, theyll work really hard to do that. So I think if the solutions that exist technically work for people from a productivity point of view, then it's much more likely to be a continuation of the same trend. But the industry is just beginning its transition to 64 layer device architecture and there's a lot of learning ahead of the industry. So I see both scenarios potentially playing out with an overwhelming bias to stay with vertical scaling as an architectural choice just because it's the lowest risk path normally. Operator And we have another question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari Yeah. Thanks. Hopefully, I don't get cut off this time. Martin, I had a question on 2018. I realize we're early here, but when you think about the multiple growth opportunities you're exposed to, what are you most excited about into 2018 and on the flip side, what do you worry about the most? Martin Anstice I'm really excited about where the electronics industry is generally. I mean, from my perspective, I don't know that in my 16 years of this industry and this company, I'd be more excited by the diversity of kind of innovation and opportunity for the silicon roadmap. I think it's just tremendous time. And if you're investing consistent with that opportunity, you've got a nice future ahead if you can kind of keep executing and solving very complex technical problems. So I'm really excited and that's a very holistic statement on some pretty compelling diverse -- device diverse application technology drivers that are relevant to cloud and enterprise and mass storage agendas as well as the advanced computation agenda that is necessary to really harness the value out of a connected world. So I mean that's the excitement for me. None of that can happen without a silicon roadmap. So that's pretty cool. What am I most worried about? I am not worried about that much if I'm honest with you in the long term. I mean you've got to keep executing and this is a hard industry. We have to work really hard to do what we do. So our focus and our intensity around operational execution is something that takes a lot of hard work. The macro is an unknown and uncontrollable and hence the focus on flexibility and variability in our business model and the technical challenges don't get easier, but I feel like the technical depth of our company is one of our strengths.  Toshiya Hari Okay. Great. And then I had a follow up on the logic business. I was a little bit surprised how low system shipments were in Q1 or the March quarter. In the past, youve talked about the CMOS image sensor business potentially picking up off of a low base in 2016 and you've also talked about some market share or potential market share gains in the microprocessor space going forward. So when should we expect the logic segment of your business to pick up meaningfully from a shipment and revenue perspective? Thank you. Doug Bettinger Ill give you a comment, Toshiya. I think March is probably the low point in terms of what the calendar year looks like from a system shipment standpoint in the logic and other, its going to strengthen through the back half of the year. Operator Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Moore Great. Thank you. In terms of NAND, I think you're talking about little bit of a higher percentage of wafers on 3D at year end. I think you said 700,000 before and now saying a little over half, which I think is north of 750. Is that incremental supply do you think or am I being too literal about that or is that sort of more conversion from plaintiff to 3D? Martin Anstice Actually, on the fly, I don't know that I know that there's a particular bias one way or the other. It was and continues to be at least in terms of wafer starts to pretty balanced year between kind of new greenfields and the conversion, maybe slightly more conversion, but it is pretty balanced. And certainly our expectations at the end of calendar 17 for shipped capacity in active qualification mode kind of similar to the level thats going into the year. So no real story in terms of supply and demand imbalance. Joe Moore Okay. And then where do you see the end point on that mix. You have these fully depreciated planar fabs, do you think there's a long tail on that capacity or will you see conversion to either 3D or to DRAM over time? Martin Anstice Yeah. I mean, the customers obviously are most qualified to answer that question. As best as I can tell, there was an intended conversion of the majority of the installed base over a period that runs probably four years from now. And that's without kind of the conversation around the secular demand trends and what that means for kind of bid growth and so on and so forth. So I believe if we're sitting here in four years time, there will still be some planar installed base, but it will be a minority. Doug Bettinger Will be very small, Joe. Operator Our next question comes from Romit Shaw with Nomura Investment. Romit Shaw Yes. Thank you. Doug, I heard you just refer others back to the financial model from November. But back then, you had a basically a 2019, 2020 target of 26% operating margin on like 8.5 billion to 9.3 billion in revenue and this quarter, it looks like you're going to be run rating at the high end of that range and operating margin is going to come in per guidance at about 27%. So with all due respect, the model does feel a little bit stale and I guess my question is if we're to assume that LAM can get to 10 billion annualized at some point in the future, how do we think about operating margin? Doug Bettinger Yeah. Romit with all due respect, 27 and 26 isnt wildly different. So me guiding you back the model is a place that you ought to gravitate towards. I don't have a model out there that's a $10 billion model, Romit, but if there was one, it probably would be better profitability than the $9 billion model. There is leverage in the model. You've seen it from us as we've grown and I would expect that you would continue to see it if we were to grow beyond the high end of what I have out there right now. Romit Shaw Okay. The other question I had was just on the decision to do an accelerated buyback, just given the strong share performance and the potential for repatriation, can you guys just talk a little bit about timing here? Doug Bettinger When we announced the buyback, it was $1 billion program, $1 billion buyback over a 12 to 18 month timeframe. As we executed through it, I felt like getting into the June quarter, we needed to step up the pace a little bit to execute to what we said we're going to do and that's what we're doing and why we're doing a little bit more in June. And yet Romit, I wish I'd done it a quarter ago when the share price was lower, but hindsight's always 2020 with stuff like that. Operator Well take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Mehdi Hosseini Yes. Most of the questions have been asked. I have two follow ups. Going back to your Analyst Day presentation, specifically on 3D NAND, you were saying that the 96 layer 3D NAND should start being investment for 96 layer 3D NAND should start sometime in late 2018 early 2019. Should we expect another round of bakeoff for that particular node? And if that's the case, is that going to happen early 18 and I have a follow up? Martin Anstice Well I think the reality of frankly the entire industry, not just NAND is, if a customer can keep doing what they're doing which is a commentary on materials and device architecture and process flow and equipment selection, they have every interest to do that because that's where the learning is and these are hard problems and challenges. So that tends to, not that any one of us are isolated from the competitive realities of life. But once you have high volume manufacturing positions and you have a learning that other people do not, your positions are generally very strong. So there is nothing extraordinary about the 96 layer structure in terms of how the customer will sink through and select equipments and we have the strongest high volume manufacturing position in the segments of our industry. So it doesn't mean we dont have to work hard, because we do. But we feel confident about the future of the company and the trajectory of our performance we've described to you. Mehdi Hosseini And a quick follow-up for Doug, you have above $18 net cash per share, how much of that is onshore versus offshore and what are your plans for the cash that is offshore in case there's no change to taxation? Doug Bettinger Mehdi, we finished last quarter, I think it was probably about -- maybe a little bit about 30% onshore, so about 70% offshore. Whole question around tax reform and when or if or what have you obviously is very topical and feels like every day, it's a little bit different. We're very much taking a wait and see approach, now whether or not to be any tax reform, there's a variety of different ways you navigate through that. But I'm more encouraged today than ever that we're actually going to get something done. Operator That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Mr. Kumar, I turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Satya Kumar Yes. Thank you all for joining us and that concludes the conference call.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Well take our first question from Stephen Chin with UBS Bank. Stephen Chin My first question is just on your early outlook for the 2018 industry wafer fab equipment spending. Does 2018 appear to be another growth year for WFE because of indigenous China or is it just continued spend by incumbent than in foundry and memory logic? Thanks. Martin Anstice I think if I try to answer that definitively, I'd be a little bit misleading. I think that its still early days but based on the data points that we see today Stephen, we see sustainability in the context of the discipline of capital investments, the relative balance and stability between kind of supply and demand as best we can tell in the industry. And particularly on the last part of your question, the China story, the domestic China story at least we believe it's more of a calendar 18 investment than calendar 17. So really our comments are comments about discipline in capacity additions and what we think are pretty compelling and exciting, and sustainable long-term demand trends. At the end of the day if that plays out as it is more generally described today the investment will follow. Stephen Chin Just a quick follow-up on memory CapEx to sales trends. It sounds like memory fundamentals are healthy and historically we've seen memory industry have a CapEx to sales ratio of 30% to 35%. Do you think that CapEx to sales ratio is still a good sustainable scenario for the market or it's likely that CapEx to sales to go higher in light of the scalability issues with 3D NAND and slowing DRAM transition. Thanks. Martin Anstice Honestly Stephen, I've never been a really big fan of capital intensity ratios because I think it kind of whipsaws us around in terms of the analytics in any one quarter and the reality is the economics of an addition in new capacity is a very different economics than a conversion. We're pretty agnostic in the NAND space to how our customers execute those plans as we've previously described. And in terms of wafer starts, it looks to us like the investments of this year are kind of pretty balanced between Greenfield and conversion. So we look to the sustainability question more in terms of kind of balance of bit growth demand and our understanding of supply additions. And I think kind of the market generally is telling that story. So I don't really have anything to tell you that will cause the future to be very different from the past in terms of that particular metric. Doug Bettinger The only thing Id like to point out Stephen is obviously, you know what memory revenue is likely to be this year, it's super strong, right. And so youve always have to think about affordability and clearly the levels that are going on today are affordable given how strong revenue and memory is. Operator Moving onto to our next question, our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri I guess the first question, Doug is to you. Just looking out into the third calendar quarter, it looks like you guys said a little used words a little more balanced than what the 55/45 was, so maybe it sounds like second half shipments was down something like maybe 10% half on half. So that would sort of say 4.5 million shipments in the back half of the year. So maybe [indiscernible] in the third calendar quarter, is that like roughly the right math. Doug Bettinger Yeah, I mean we're - Tim, as you know we guide one quarter at time, well give you a little bit of color which is what Martin did, when he said a little more balanced than the 55/45 and there's also reason I gave you the deferred revenue number, so you can think about how that likely transpires through the year. I'm not going to guide the third calendar quarter or the fourth, but I think we've given you enough to model it pretty closely. Martin Anstice Maybe just kind of two things to add quickly. I think our outlook today at least would cause us to believe that the December quarter is our weakest shipments quarter of the year, so that's kind of one extra data point. Another one is just kind of plain simple math of the disclosure that we've given, so the sum of our actual performance in our guidance today is the first half shipment of 4.9. You will I'm sure all make their own judgments about how much better the balance is than we previously described, but if you just use the math of 55/45 proxy than the shipments for the year is approximately $8.9 billion and in a ramping year the revenues lack the shipment. So I think those numbers are the ones that we're kind of intending you to embrace. Timothy Arcuri Then I just had a question about the deferred revenue balance, Doug, which you were talking about before. I mean, you guys are now up to about 1.7 months, if I look into June, youre going to have about 1.7 months if you add Japan plus the deferred, you know, the regular balance. And it starts to look a little like the old Lam sort of in terms of backlog, not the new short lead time Lam. Is there a dynamic there, maybe you're shifting more new products or there's something happening in NAND and sort of - can you help us understand what sort of catch-up we should see because obviously you're going to revenue a lot more than youll ship during the back-half of the year. Martin Anstice Yeah, it's pretty simple to think through this Tim, when you've got shipments that are growing the way we have the last several quarters, revenue almost always lags at growth and shipments. When shipments level off or if they were to decline sequentially, revenue will catch up, it's just a natural progression of the timing between with something shows up at the customer's dock and it gets into acceptance and revenue. Doug Bettinger But specifically is your question, Tim, as more kind of headline for us in terms of the timelines for ship to install and therefore acceptance of revenues. In any one quarter and you don't get to see this unfortunately, but the specific scheduling of shipments in any one week or any one day of any one month, I mean, that kind of jerks the ratios around. So there's is no real story here in terms of kind of changing dynamic of timeline. Operator Our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead. Patrick Ho First off, in terms of your comments about a more balanced 2017 between first half and second half, is there any one specific market segment that's driving this better balance or is it a confluence of all the markets you mentioned in your prepared remarks? Martin Anstice Well maybe Ill break that into two parts. So what changed for us between this earnings call and the last earnings call, if you look at kind of the expansion in the business that we've reported and we're anticipating approximately two-thirds of that is in NAND space and a third is in foundry logic. So that would at least tell you that - to the assumptions we made and disclosed previously there's no real headline in terms of DRAM. So that would be the first part of the maybe the most helpful part of answering you question. Maybe I'll stop there, did I get what you wanted? Patrick Ho Yes, actually thats very helpful Martin. And my follow-up question maybe for Doug, in terms of the ramp up of shipments you talked about, you kept your supply chain at really optimal levels with inventory and even AR. What are some of I guess the nuances or the tricks that youre keeping the supply chain as tight and efficient as it's been particularly as shipments continue to ramp up over these last few quarters? Doug Bettinger I mean its continued focus on just managing our remote factories, managing our own internal facilities, anticipating what we were going to need to be able to support at this point months and months ago and communicating that to our supply chain partners, Patrick. I mean it's operational excellence, the way Lam has always executed, just at a different scale here. Martin Anstice And just adding, I would say, honest hard work and when you hear us talk about our customer trust orientation, when you hear us talk about collaborative and partnership orientation that's pretty fundamental relative to sustaining your ability to perform and execute with the level of variability that is part of our business through the consolidation of our customers in the last several years. So our supply chain and our own factory and our field service engineers have done a tremendous job scaling in a very short period of time. And we continue to be proactive as proactive as we can be based on our visibility to ensure that investments are kind of made ahead of the need to support and service our customers. And competitively as best I can tell, we're doing just fine. Operator Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar I have two of them, the first one for Martin. You're NAND shipments are at record high and 3D NAND spending is robust. I'm just curious if the pricing for NAND rolls over, will the reality of economics weaken and the 3D NAND makers might scale back CapEx or do you think the demand is strong enough to continue investing in capacity. Then I have a follow up. Martin Anstice Yeah, I mean I think you know one of our headlines obviously is there's a long way to go with the NAND story. And as I know you understand extremely well the economics of that device architecture are one of the most relevant parts to the penetration of SSDs and so on and so forth. So, I mean there's a positive for every negative. We see a long way to go, we see compelling demand drivers for that architecture and as we've described a number of times particularly in critical applications, the high volume manufacturing position of Lam in that inflection is outstanding. That's the best word that I could use to describe the position that we worked hard to achieve and sustain. So there's a long way to go and best we can tell, commitment to technology and sustainability to investment will go up and down along the way for sure, but long term, it feels pretty good. Krish Sankar Then a follow-up for Doug, Doug you mentioned in your comments that the headcount addition for new product development. Im kind of curious, is this because these new products youre developing, you don't have the core competency within Lam i.e. full wafer deposition or etch-related technologies and is it why you're hiring or am I just reading too much into it. Doug Bettinger Yeah, youre reading too much into Krish. I mean, any time you're doing more this year than you did last year you need more people to execute that, that's the statement around R&D. The biggest area of increase in headcount though Krish is, operations as well as the field who are shipping product real time and installing it at the customers facility. Martin Anstice And maybe just to add to that, let's kind of go back to disclosure of the last earnings call, because there's two stories in the company, one of them is the story of creating a road map of products and technology that was relevant for inflections anticipating how those inflections would have a concentration of spending for etch and deposition particularly. The second part of it was building the competitiveness of the portfolio we have so we get a bigger share of it and we gave two very important headlines in the last earnings call. One of them was the statement about how our foundry business grows and we characterized the growth in our foundry business year-over-year 16, 15 of 40% compared to a 25% WFE reference and we also stated that in NAND, we grow shipments by 80% year-over-year almost twice as the rate of WFE growth. So the headcount of the company is a lifecycle statement. So you add headcount when you prepare to do that and you add headcounts when you're in the middle of doing it and to some extent through the lifetime in an installed base business, the tail will demand at certain points, adding additional headcounts for many years to come and that's a natural commentary on the evolution of the company. Krish Sankar Got you. Thats very helpful. Thanks guys and great execution. Operator And well move on to our next question. Our next question comes from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Farhan Ahmad Thanks for taking my question. I had a question in terms of the sustainability. The year on year growth that youve seen is quite impressive in the first half of this year. Now if I look back more recently since maybe 2010, the cyclicality of the business has gone down and that also implies that like year on year comparisons have not been that fair. So the fact that you're having too much growth right now, is that a concern in your mind in anyway and should that bring concerns of cyclicality back into the industry. Martin Anstice Yeah. In my opinion, no. I mean I might be wrong, but I think that there has been a fundamental transition in the industry as the supply chain is matured and as there's been concentration in the semiconductor industry. The traditional history of the industry was an over investment for many players and then a contraction. I think that's kind of long gone by virtue of scale and scope of the economics of the industry and the technical risks and opportunities to kind of go with it. But what is always still true is it's still difficult to predict and maybe increasingly so because there is no one kind of killer app or killer devices that diverse the demand drivers. Its more difficult to predict for our customers and therefore for us. There is some variability of spending and one element of our focus on competitive differentiation is business model flexibility and its not actually that easy to ramp the capacity of your company by 40% to an average baseline of prior year. I mean that's a lot of hard work. The variability and flexible business model is a critical part of the success of the company and hopefully that will be a long term statement of value for our shareholders. Farhan Ahmad Thanks, Martin. And then one question on China. There's a lot of expectation around memory investment in China next year. The question I have for you is that from your perspective, has the visibility of memory projects changed for China for next and is that a part that you see for China memory investments next year without some foreign IP coming in to the picture. Martin Anstice Yeah. I think I'd probably say the same thing today that I've said for a while now and there clearly seems to be conviction to a plan that looks rational in terms of its kind of fundamental business objectives and your ability to execute as a byproduct of two things, knowing how to make the devices you want to sell and then having the operational scale to pull it off and whether that comes from M&A or IP licensing or just the developments of organic know how, I think we will see over time as best we can tell, we still believe that the China memory investment conversation is more a calendar 18 story than calendar 17 story and just to give you a little bit more color on the calendar 18 kind of holistically, we're tracking about 10 new fabs next year and to our understanding of the investment plans in those fabs, more than 80% of the wafer start additions will be not in China. So that's another data point that hopefully allows you to triangulate a little more. Operator Well take our next question from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, on the fact youve talked about service running at around 20% of revenues. As you clearly increased your installed base over the last couple of years, curious, has that increased and/or when could we see an acceleration for that part of your business? Martin Anstice Well, I think whether its accelerating enough, I'll let you decide. But at least for the last couple of years, we've had a pretty intense focus on broadening our work I would say to a customer. So advanced services agenda and a creative use of software, really employing strategies around machine learning and harnessing the data from the information that's available to us and to our customers in ways that create value, whether its productivity oriented or extendibility oriented, there's a number of very meaningful projects. The business has been growing faster than the pace of the installed base and it continues to do so this year. And I would say we would expect the momentum in kind of the 18 to be stronger than 17 on that point. But it takes some time right and you develop new products and services, there's no magic depending on swing. It takes a number of years to really demonstrate and deliver the value and have the customer convicted that transition makes sense for them. C.J. Muse Very helpful. And just as a follow up, when you think about the back half and I'm not asking for shipment guide, but as you think about mix and I think the takeaway from some of your comments earlier is that deferred revenues should help revenues exchange shipment from Q4. Curious how we should be thinking about gross margin trajectory in the second half? Doug Bettinger C.J., the guidance I gave you as you think to margin percentages, even though were maybe not exactly on the financial model, we provided to you the margin percentages in the financial model are still good guideposts if you will in terms of how to model our business. So Id encourage you to go back and have a look at what we shared with you in November there. Operator Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur Good afternoon and solid job on the quarterly execution. On your view on better foundry and logic spend, of that incremental spending improvement, does it include a bottoming out of the number of customers relative to your prior view and is the incremental spend more leading edge 10 and 7 or more follow through on legacy 28 nanometer. Martin Anstice Most of the increment was ten at least compared and contrasted with our comments of the last earnings call and I don't know that our expectations for broadening are any different today than they were then. We expected there to be a number of customers making those investments and it's kind of playing out that way. Maybe one of the things I could have actually added earlier and maybe Ill do it now, Harlan, is when we look at our first half, second half, we believe that the first half memory is stronger than the second half memory from a shipments point of view and logic foundry is stronger second half than first half. So that's our view of kind of wafer fabrication equipment spending balance in the first half, second half by segment. Harlan Sur Thanks for the insights there, Martin. And then on the strong memory shipment environment, what we're hearing probably the same thing you guys are is that DRAM and NAND suppliers are kind of hand to mouth right, in other words, the shipping whatever they can build even always in the seasonally weaker March quarter, so I guess my question is, are you sensing more urgency to drive accelerated node migrations Whether that 1X for DRAM or 64 layers for NAND, Im just wondering if we're going to see a step up in node migration cadence just given the industry supply constraints. Martin Anstice Interesting question. I don't know if I would articulate a cadence message. I mean clearly there's a commitment to technology in conversions in memory and DRAM this year and that was a big part of the increments year-over-year from a spending and overall performance of the company. But I still don't think we're modeling any more than 25% of the installed base at the 1X node by the end of this year. So thats a reference there and maybe there's a statement on cadence, but there's clearly momentum and ambition to 64 layer devices. But if you look at the installed base of 3D NAND capacity at the end of this year, there's still a pretty broad mix of 3D capacity, right. So not only is there the reality that approximately half of the NAND installed base is 3D capable, there is the dynamic that some proportion of that 3D capable device is 32 player device capable, some proportion is 48 and some proportion is 64. So there's a long way to go with the installed base and supply chain, independent of the demand story. Operator Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a few questions. First is, there are some concerns that the second derivative of the 3D NAND wafer additions has peaked. Clearly, you had opportunity to gain share going from 2D to 3D, as you address the biggest portion of the market, but let's say the number of 3D NAND wafer addition next year is exactly the same as this year in 2018. How should we think about your revenue opportunity to NAND and technology or help you do better than what you did this year. Martin Anstice I have no idea. I mean its such a precise question with due respect. I mean, the complexity of the customers roadmap and spending, there are so many moving parts on that. I mean the best I can give you is that you got to take your own position on how much legitimate demand there is for 3D nonvolatile memory. We're pretty optimistic, but you make your own call on that. Whatever the level of demand that there is, Lam Research is going to perform better than the average equipment company maybe by a long way and that's the message we've tried to convey in terms of the criticality of etch and deposition in the device manufacturing process flow and it's the message that we try to articulate relative to critical applications, market share etch and dep at the 90% level. And it's the message that we've tried to articulate in terms of market share generally from plaintiffs to 3D which is almost a double digit gain in market share. So whatever it is, Lam Research is going to be a company in the mix of equipment companies that will be on the kind of upper end of the scale of performance as long as we keep executing in the ways that we have demonstrated in the last several years. I apologize I cant answer directly your question, but hopefully that context is helpful. Sidney Ho That's super helpful. Maybe switching to foundry and logic, in the past, you talked about yours and maybe in the dep etch clean opportunity goes up a lot every node, I think just comment on your share gains in this segment, but at the same time, TSMC, again, this is probably not new, but last week, they talked about the capital intensity probably stayed within pretty stable range over next few years. Can you help us square those comments and when its going up a lot and when its kind of flattish? Martin Anstice Yeah. I mean, obviously, the comments from any one customer are going to be WFE comments and the comments have come from the company, from us or segment specific, right. So our story is generally as you articulated in the microprocessor space. I think we've conveyed now for a couple of years a very different reality of engagement with the customer than was true five years ago and as I already noted again by repeating the disclosure of the last earnings call, our market share momentum in foundry has also been positive through the 10 nanometer and 7 nanometer transitions and all of that is true and supplemented by the fact that through the 10 and 7 and 5 nanometer technology roadmap, the proportion of SAM in etch and deposition systematically increases with the adoption of EUV thats I would say the consensus adoption assumptions and that's really a commentary on the progress that's been made in the economics of multi-patterning and it's a commentary on the insertion of EUR with a multi-patterning process flow and it's a commentary on probably 70% of multi-patterning integration schemes being spacer based. So there's a lot of kind of moving parts, but pretty positive story I think independent of the overarching statement that you've made and maybe one last point, logic and foundry are as invested as ever if not more so in utilizing their installed base and that will continue to be true for all of our customers. Operator The next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. Martin, I had a question on 2018. I realize we're early here, but  Martin Anstice We lost you. Satya Kumar Operator, are you there? Operator I am. We will move on to our next question. The next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Atif Malik Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on good result and guide. Martin, you were a keynote speaker at SEMICON China in March, I Just wanted to know if you're confident in domestic Chinese spending based on discussions in China is higher about the same than what was three months ago. Martin Anstice It's about the same and I would say as a context, I'm a keynote speaker in SEMICON conferences all around the world. So I don't read too much into, I happened to show up in China. So we continue to believe there's substance to their ambition. We continue to believe they're working really hard and as is true for our customers globally, our job is to support as best we can and that's true for every customer wherever they are. Atif Malik Great. And then as a follow up, can you talk about the image sensor market? In your 37 billion plus WFE outlook, how big is the image sensor opportunity and what are the trends you're seeing in that market this year? Martin Anstice Yeah. I don't know Atif that we've quantified it specifically and I don't think we're going to today. What I would tell you directionally relative to last year is its stronger this year than it was last year, probably not as strong as it was the year before, but we're seeing nice momentum in image sensor and it's a very etch and deposition intensive process and our position is strong. Our share position is very strong.  Operator Well move on to our next question. Our next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead. Weston Twigg Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, just wanted to ask about DRAM. You said your outlook hasn't changed much for this year yet, but I'm just wondering as you look out in to 2018, big growth is pretty hard to come by, are you expecting some of that positive view on 2018 to come from DRAM capacity expansion in fabs? Martin Anstice We're not assuming much of anything in terms of increased wafer stocks I would say in DRAM just as a general modeling statement and I'd say that for 18 as much as they would 17 and maybe even 20. I mean I think our long term model is basically kind of flat lined wafer stocks in DRAM. The spending is all about technology conversion. Generally speaking, the demand statement is all about content more than units of any one device and there are some really interesting kind of demand opportunities for our customers and clearly there are some rumors I would say at various points in time around speculating of increased investments if and when our customers start articulating that, then obviously we're well positioned than we would participate naturally in that as strongly as we have in our past. Weston Twigg Okay. That's helpful. And then secondarily, just looking ahead on 3D NAND scaling, youve talked about having good positions through 64 layer and trying to get good positioning for the 96 layer process, but just wondering if you're seeing a continued push for increased layer height from customers or if theyre finding the scaling challenges are limiting then, you'll see them sort of double up on string stacking doublings layers of 64 or 48 for example. Martin Anstice Yeah. I mean I think the industry is at a still and customers specifically are still working through the answers to those questions. From a traditional scaling point of view, vertical scaling point of view, I mean we have customer engagements that extend beyond the 96 layer. So were actively working with customers of that layer count in its element environment and as is true, if a customer can continue the same integration scheme and same equipment selection and the same materials, theyll work really hard to do that. So I think if the solutions that exist technically work for people from a productivity point of view, then it's much more likely to be a continuation of the same trend. But the industry is just beginning its transition to 64 layer device architecture and there's a lot of learning ahead of the industry. So I see both scenarios potentially playing out with an overwhelming bias to stay with vertical scaling as an architectural choice just because it's the lowest risk path normally. Operator And we have another question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari Yeah. Thanks. Hopefully, I don't get cut off this time. Martin, I had a question on 2018. I realize we're early here, but when you think about the multiple growth opportunities you're exposed to, what are you most excited about into 2018 and on the flip side, what do you worry about the most? Martin Anstice I'm really excited about where the electronics industry is generally. I mean, from my perspective, I don't know that in my 16 years of this industry and this company, I'd be more excited by the diversity of kind of innovation and opportunity for the silicon roadmap. I think it's just tremendous time. And if you're investing consistent with that opportunity, you've got a nice future ahead if you can kind of keep executing and solving very complex technical problems. So I'm really excited and that's a very holistic statement on some pretty compelling diverse -- device diverse application technology drivers that are relevant to cloud and enterprise and mass storage agendas as well as the advanced computation agenda that is necessary to really harness the value out of a connected world. So I mean that's the excitement for me. None of that can happen without a silicon roadmap. So that's pretty cool. What am I most worried about? I am not worried about that much if I'm honest with you in the long term. I mean you've got to keep executing and this is a hard industry. We have to work really hard to do what we do. So our focus and our intensity around operational execution is something that takes a lot of hard work. The macro is an unknown and uncontrollable and hence the focus on flexibility and variability in our business model and the technical challenges don't get easier, but I feel like the technical depth of our company is one of our strengths.  Toshiya Hari Okay. Great. And then I had a follow up on the logic business. I was a little bit surprised how low system shipments were in Q1 or the March quarter. In the past, youve talked about the CMOS image sensor business potentially picking up off of a low base in 2016 and you've also talked about some market share or potential market share gains in the microprocessor space going forward. So when should we expect the logic segment of your business to pick up meaningfully from a shipment and revenue perspective? Thank you. Doug Bettinger Ill give you a comment, Toshiya. I think March is probably the low point in terms of what the calendar year looks like from a system shipment standpoint in the logic and other, its going to strengthen through the back half of the year. Operator Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Moore Great. Thank you. In terms of NAND, I think you're talking about little bit of a higher percentage of wafers on 3D at year end. I think you said 700,000 before and now saying a little over half, which I think is north of 750. Is that incremental supply do you think or am I being too literal about that or is that sort of more conversion from plaintiff to 3D? Martin Anstice Actually, on the fly, I don't know that I know that there's a particular bias one way or the other. It was and continues to be at least in terms of wafer starts to pretty balanced year between kind of new greenfields and the conversion, maybe slightly more conversion, but it is pretty balanced. And certainly our expectations at the end of calendar 17 for shipped capacity in active qualification mode kind of similar to the level thats going into the year. So no real story in terms of supply and demand imbalance. Joe Moore Okay. And then where do you see the end point on that mix. You have these fully depreciated planar fabs, do you think there's a long tail on that capacity or will you see conversion to either 3D or to DRAM over time? Martin Anstice Yeah. I mean, the customers obviously are most qualified to answer that question. As best as I can tell, there was an intended conversion of the majority of the installed base over a period that runs probably four years from now. And that's without kind of the conversation around the secular demand trends and what that means for kind of bid growth and so on and so forth. So I believe if we're sitting here in four years time, there will still be some planar installed base, but it will be a minority. Doug Bettinger Will be very small, Joe. Operator Our next question comes from Romit Shaw with Nomura Investment. Romit Shaw Yes. Thank you. Doug, I heard you just refer others back to the financial model from November. But back then, you had a basically a 2019, 2020 target of 26% operating margin on like 8.5 billion to 9.3 billion in revenue and this quarter, it looks like you're going to be run rating at the high end of that range and operating margin is going to come in per guidance at about 27%. So with all due respect, the model does feel a little bit stale and I guess my question is if we're to assume that LAM can get to 10 billion annualized at some point in the future, how do we think about operating margin? Doug Bettinger Yeah. Romit with all due respect, 27 and 26 isnt wildly different. So me guiding you back the model is a place that you ought to gravitate towards. I don't have a model out there that's a $10 billion model, Romit, but if there was one, it probably would be better profitability than the $9 billion model. There is leverage in the model. You've seen it from us as we've grown and I would expect that you would continue to see it if we were to grow beyond the high end of what I have out there right now. Romit Shaw Okay. The other question I had was just on the decision to do an accelerated buyback, just given the strong share performance and the potential for repatriation, can you guys just talk a little bit about timing here? Doug Bettinger When we announced the buyback, it was $1 billion program, $1 billion buyback over a 12 to 18 month timeframe. As we executed through it, I felt like getting into the June quarter, we needed to step up the pace a little bit to execute to what we said we're going to do and that's what we're doing and why we're doing a little bit more in June. And yet Romit, I wish I'd done it a quarter ago when the share price was lower, but hindsight's always 2020 with stuff like that. Operator Well take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Mehdi Hosseini Yes. Most of the questions have been asked. I have two follow ups. Going back to your Analyst Day presentation, specifically on 3D NAND, you were saying that the 96 layer 3D NAND should start being investment for 96 layer 3D NAND should start sometime in late 2018 early 2019. Should we expect another round of bakeoff for that particular node? And if that's the case, is that going to happen early 18 and I have a follow up? Martin Anstice Well I think the reality of frankly the entire industry, not just NAND is, if a customer can keep doing what they're doing which is a commentary on materials and device architecture and process flow and equipment selection, they have every interest to do that because that's where the learning is and these are hard problems and challenges. So that tends to, not that any one of us are isolated from the competitive realities of life. But once you have high volume manufacturing positions and you have a learning that other people do not, your positions are generally very strong. So there is nothing extraordinary about the 96 layer structure in terms of how the customer will sink through and select equipments and we have the strongest high volume manufacturing position in the segments of our industry. So it doesn't mean we dont have to work hard, because we do. But we feel confident about the future of the company and the trajectory of our performance we've described to you. Mehdi Hosseini And a quick follow-up for Doug, you have above $18 net cash per share, how much of that is onshore versus offshore and what are your plans for the cash that is offshore in case there's no change to taxation? Doug Bettinger Mehdi, we finished last quarter, I think it was probably about -- maybe a little bit about 30% onshore, so about 70% offshore. Whole question around tax reform and when or if or what have you obviously is very topical and feels like every day, it's a little bit different. We're very much taking a wait and see approach, now whether or not to be any tax reform, there's a variety of different ways you navigate through that. But I'm more encouraged today than ever that we're actually going to get something done. Operator That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Mr. Kumar, I turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Satya Kumar Yes. Thank you all for joining us and that concludes the conference call.

LLC Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Marriott International First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Marriott International. Sir, you may begin. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. First let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today, May 9, 2017, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. In our discussion today we'll talk about results excluding merger-related costs, and we'll compare 2017 results to prior-year combined results, which assume Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business was completed on January 1, 2015. Of course, comparisons to our prior year reported results are in last night's press release, which you can find along with the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor. So let's get started. Over the past few weeks we held hotel General Manager conferences around the world from Toronto to Mexico City, New Orleans to Dubai, and London to Macau. At those meetings we discussed the tremendous potential of the new Marriott International, whether it was capturing economies of scale from our substantially broader distribution, capitalizing on opportunities for revenue and cost synergies, or building on the excitement about our loyalty programs. The enthusiasm and energy of the General Managers was simply terrific. We are successfully melding two talented organizations and it's exciting to see everyone working together. At every stop, there was tremendous optimism about our future. I expect our strong results in the first quarter will increase that optimism, given the extensive integration work that is underway, I'm proud of our Hotel teams around the world for their focus on running the business, taking care of guests and driving results. Across our company worldwide systemwide RevPAR increased 3.1% in the first quarter with a nearly 2 percentage point improvement in occupancy. Worldwide RevPAR index rose for both legacy Marriott and legacy Starwood portfolios, increasing nearly one full point on a combined basis. Our operating teams kept their eye on the ball translating RevPAR growth into 100 basis points of higher house profit margin. We added more than 17,000 rooms in the quarter and increased the development pipeline by nearly 10,000 rooms. With the improvement in RevPAR and margins and continued growth in distribution, our first quarter combined fee revenue grew 6%, adjusted EBITDA increased 10%, and adjusted diluted EPS rose 38% over the prior year combined results. In North America, systemwide RevPAR rose 3.1% in the quarter. Our hotels in the greater Washington D.C. area benefited from January's inauguration and Women's March. Systemwide RevPAR in D.C. increased 15% in the quarter compared to the prior year and well ahead of our expectations. Performance in Hawaii also exceeded expectations. Strong transient demand came from both mainland and international guests, pushing systemwide RevPAR up 7%. The rough weather on the U.S. West Coast likely encouraged some last-minute bookings to the islands. Demand in Canada was particularly strong with comparable constant dollar RevPAR rising 10% in the quarter. This year is Canada's 150th anniversary and Montreal's 375th. With favorable exchange rates our hotels in Canada are hosting more international guests ready to celebrate. Laura is already packing her bags for the summer. While these markets were particularly strong, RevPAR also exceeded expectations in many other North American markets. Across the North American region, group RevPAR rose 7.7% year-over-year, benefiting from the events in Washington and the shift in the Easter holiday to the second quarter. Group RevPAR modestly exceeded our expectations due to strong attendance at group meetings while meeting planners continued to add last minute food, beverage and ancillary spending. Full year 2017 group revenue booking pace for all our North American full service hotels is up 1.6% over a strong 2016 group year. We've seen some weakness in new bookings from small groups in recent months, but with very strong occupancy rates at many hotels and 86% of our anticipated 2017 group business already on the books, space constraints have also made adding new groups more challenging. Meeting planners recognizing that meeting space is filling continue to book earlier in some cases for multiple years, a practice we have encouraged. By the way with nearly 4,500 hotels in North America we have a great selection for meeting planners whether they are booking a large meeting for multiple years or a small meeting for next week. In fact in the first quarter, group RevPAR at our limited service hotels increased 10%, and booking pace for our legacy Marriott limited service hotels for the full year is up over 5%. Transient RevPAR in North America was up nearly 2% year-over-year in the quarter constrained by the timing of Easter and high occupancy rates. At the same time, transient demand exceeded our expectations, and we improved the mix of transient revenue drawing more high-rated retail and corporate customers and reducing discounts. In the second quarter, we expect lower group business year-over-year due to the timing of Easter. As a result we expect North American systemwide RevPAR will be flat to up 2% in the second quarter, and will increase 1% to 3% for the full year. On a preliminary basis, April year-to-date RevPAR systemwide for North America is up roughly 2%. Our North America 2017 RevPAR guidance is 100 basis points ahead of the guidance we issued in February. To be sure, transient demand was better than expected in the first quarter and our outlook for full year transient business has improved a bit. But even in February, when we last issued guidance, we were expecting our first quarter RevPAR growth would be somewhat over the midpoint of our 0% to 2% RevPAR forecast. So moving our North America RevPAR guidance to 1% to 3% isn't quite as large a shift as it may first appear. In the Asia-Pacific region we're encouraged by recent economic growth. First quarter systemwide RevPAR increased 5% with strength in retail and corporate business. RevPAR in India and Indonesia increased at double-digit rates, while in Greater China systemwide RevPAR rose 5% with strength in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. Hotels in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau outperformed our expectations in the quarter. Given these trends we expect our second quarter and full year RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region will increase at a mid single digit rate. This is higher than our prior guidance due to strengthening transient demand. RevPAR also exceeded expectations in Europe, increasing 7% year-over-year on solid transient and group demand, and strong international arrivals. European room nights sold to U.S. travelers alone increased at a mid-teens rate in the first quarter. Greater group business in the UK and Germany allowed us to improve the mix of transient business in those markets, and RevPAR growth at our Paris hotels was ahead of expectations. We expect our hotels in Europe will continue to show strength through 2017, and we expect our second quarter and full-year RevPAR will increase at a mid single digit rate, a bit higher than our last guidance. In the Middle East RevPAR growth in the first quarter was flat, consistent with our expectations. Geopolitical unrest, low oil prices, and lower government spending continued to depress hotel results. The good news was in Africa where RevPAR increased more than 18% with strength in Egypt. RevPAR in South Africa alone increased 9%, as the weak Rand continued to attract tourism to this great destination. Middle East RevPAR continues to be a challenge to forecast. While we aren't modeling a meaningful change in oil prices or government spending, comparisons should get easier in most markets as the year progresses. As a result we expect Middle East Africa RevPAR will be modestly lower in the second quarter, but improve in the second half, resulting in flattish performance for the full year 2017. In the Caribbean and Latin America systemwide RevPAR in the first quarter declined 2% year-over-year. RevPAR in Mexico increased at a high teens rate, while RevPAR declined in the Caribbean, largely due to lower leisure demand with the shift in the Easter holiday. Lower RevPAR in South America reflected a weak economy and oversupply in Brazil. You may recall that the Zika virus began to impact our business in February of 2016. We expect easier comparisons in the region late in the year, and stronger performance in the Caribbean in the second quarter, due to the shifting Easter holiday. This should yield a low single digit increase in RevPAR in both the second quarter and full-year 2017. With this solid improvement in international RevPAR, we expect second quarter and full-year worldwide 2017 RevPAR will increase 1% to 3%. Our full-year worldwide RevPAR growth outlook is about 50 basis points higher than our prior guidance, largely due to better than expected results in the first quarter, and improving demand in Asia and Europe. In the first quarter, margins at company operated hotels improved 100 basis points due to stronger RevPAR growth, better productivity, lower food costs and improved billing processes. Productivity was helped by ongoing service innovations such as Your Choice, our program that allows loyalty members the option to choose between daily housekeeping or bonus loyalty points. In the first quarter, our development pipeline increased to over 430,000 rooms, including 166,000 rooms already under construction. Today according to Smith Travel Research, one hotel in three hotels under construction in the U.S. and one hotel in four hotels under construction worldwide is associated with one of our brands. Our development success is impressive given the development climate in North America. While lending has eased for open hotels, financing for new hotel construction is challenging, with growing equity requirements. Construction costs have moved higher and we've seen some project delays in North America due to shortages of skilled subcontractors. Hotel development is picking up in Asia, even as new construction moderates in China and India. We are seeing an uptick in conversions in those countries and greater construction elsewhere in the Pacific Rim. We continue to see considerable limited service development interest in Europe overall with growing interest in Western Europe. Limited service hotels are also growing in popularity with Middle East developers, particularly in tertiary markets. Demand for our brands remains high and we are on track to deliver 6% net unit growth in 2017. Throughout the company our teams are making tremendous progress on the Starwood integration. We've already transitioned HR systems for Starwood Hotels in the U.S. and expect other continents will follow later in 2017. In March we added 36,000 associates to the Marriott payroll system. For our guests all our hotels worldwide are now on an integrated system for guest event and social media feedback. This summer we expect to publish harmonized global brand standards, which, along with regular audits, is an essential step in establishing property accountability and maintaining guest satisfaction. We've converted Starwood owned and managed hotels in North America to our procurement system. Elsewhere in the world we are reviewing and renegotiating vendor contracts to leverage our purchasing power. We are also using our purchasing platforms to track actual hotel spend to ensure the hotels realize the savings. We have already migrated all U.S. Starwood Hotels to Marriott's OTA contracts, Hotels in other continents will follow soon. This should reduce the cost of OTA bookings, as well as improve inventory control. We are rolling out Marriott's guest room entertainment platform to Starwood properties. This will lay the foundation for an enhanced television experience including On Demand streaming content and services. We are also enhancing the SPG app to enable guests at most hotels to take advantage of mobile check-in and checkout. In April we transitioned over 100 company operated Starwood Hotels in the U.S. to our above property shared service model for finance and accounting. We are on track to unify our financial reporting infrastructure in early 2018, and to realize a common technology platform for reservations and loyalty programs in late 2018. Drawing from both legacy Marriott and legacy Starwood staff, cross functional teams are coordinating meaningful change in virtually every aspect of our company's operation. This effort is enormous and we are seeing meaningful results today, and even more just over the horizon. I'm incredibly proud of the many people working on this integration, and they have my sincere thanks. As you can tell, we are excited about our business, and encouraged by recent trends. Now to explain how RevPAR and unit growth translates to EPS growth, let me turn things over to Leeny. Leeny? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Thank you, Arne. For the first quarter of 2017, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.01, $0.12 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance, $0.87 to $0.91. Fee revenue contributed $0.06 of the outperformance due to better than expected RevPAR growth, branding fees and incentive fees. Results on our owned, leased and other line outperformed by three pennies largely due to better than expected property results. Adjusted general and administrative costs were better than expected by about $0.03 mainly due to open positions and timing. Worldwide base fees increased $7 million or 3% over prior-year combined amounts, reflecting unit growth and RevPAR improvement offset somewhat by terminations, hotels that converted from management to franchise agreements, and foreign exchange. With higher RevPAR and growing distribution, franchise fees increased 10% in the quarter. Also, included in franchise fees are application fees, relicensing fees and fees from our timeshare, credit card and residential businesses. Together, these fees totaled nearly $100 million in the quarter, 14% higher than combined results in the prior year. Branding fees were particularly strong. Incentive fees increased 2% year-over-year in the first quarter constrained by deferred fees recognized in 2016, and unfavorable foreign exchange. At the same time, incentive fees were about $17 million better than expected, with $10 million of the outperformance coming from a significant number of North American full-service hotels and $7 million from hotels in the Asia-Pacific region. We expect roughly $5 million of our North America incentive fees outperformance at seasonal hotels will be reversed later in the year. Since hotels in the Asia-Pacific region typically don't have owner priorities reversals there are not likely. For the second quarter, we expect worldwide incentive fees will likely be flattish due to the timing of Easter. For the full year, with stronger RevPAR guidance and strong margins, we believe total incentive fees could increase at a mid single digit rate. Owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses totaled $81 million in the first quarter, a 6% decline from the prior year. Improved performance was more than offset by lower termination fees, which declined $7 million, and the impact of asset sales in the past 12 months, which reduced year-over-year results by $4 million. Owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses was $16 million better than we expected in the first quarter, largely due to forecast beats at hotels in Atlanta, Barcelona, London, Toronto, and Tokyo, as well as about $6 million in higher than expected termination fees. In the second quarter, we expect owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses will total roughly $90 million, compared to $115 million in the prior year. We estimate the negative impact of asset sales will be about $15 million in the second quarter, and we also expect lower results in Rio de Janeiro and New York. Our guidance for owned and leased hotels assumes no further asset sales this year. For the full year, we expect owned leased results will total $340 million to $350 million, compared to $426 million in 2016. The full-year comparison to last year's combined results includes a $40 million negative impact from asset sales, including the Westin Maui, $25 million to $30 million in lower hotel results, again largely in Rio and New York, and $15 million in lower termination fees. While asset sales reduced owned leased results they also increased management fees and free up capital for reinvestment in our business or return to shareholders. Adjusted general and administrative expenses declined by $36 million in the first quarter and beat our expectations by $17 million, largely reflecting cost reductions, open positions, and timing as the integration continues. We expect G&A will total $220 million to $225 million in the second quarter, and $880 million to $890 million for the full year. Compared to our prior guidance, the improvement in our full year outlook for G&A largely reflects the better than expected results achieved in the first quarter. We continue to expect to achieve our annualized $250 million in cost synergies by 2018, including over $200 million in annualized savings in 2017. In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 10%. Adjusted EPS in 2017 should total $3.92 to $4.09. An increase of 19% to 24% over prior-year combined results. For the full year, we expect 2017 adjusted EBITDA will total $3.1 billion to $3.195 billion, an increase of 4% to 7%. You may recall that in our February guidance for 2017, adjusted EBITDA was 3% to 6% higher than the prior year. We've increased our estimate of adjusted EBITDA since February to reflect higher fees, lower G&A, and stronger profitability of owned and leased hotels, somewhat offset by the sale of the Westin Maui. As you can see on page A-10 in the release, our new estimate of full year adjusted EBITDA also reflects some fine tuning of the add backs to net income, including correcting the share based compensation line by $27 million. That amount should have been excluded, as it was the merger-related portion of the share-based compensation costs. Investment spending for the year could total $500 million to $700 million including about $175 million in maintenance spending. To-date in 2017, we have recycled roughly $320 million through asset sales and note repayments. Cash balances were high at quarter end as we received the roughly $300 million in proceeds from the sale of the Westin Maui on March 31. We repurchased over 10 million shares through last week for approximately $925 million in 2017. We anticipate returning over $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2017. Our guidance does not include the impact of possible asset sales beyond those already completed. We appreciate your interest in Marriott. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll take your questions now. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Our first question comes from David Katz with Telsey Group. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, David. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Thank you. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC I wanted to just probe a little bit more about the guidance, and I know you've given quite a bit of detail around a lot of things, but if I'm trying to balance between your perspective on the economic climate taken in total for the remainder of the year versus the execution of the integration and just the execution of the business combination, how much of your improvement today would you say you would allocate to both? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Oh, that's a good question. And I'm not sure we've necessarily broken it down that way in our internal calculations, although clearly, as we've noted, the driving  the most significant driving factors in our increase in our RevPAR guidance was the strength of the first quarter, including in North America and the rest of the world, and the momentum that's particularly occurring in Europe and Asia-Pacific. The U.S. results, North American results, as well as the global results, obviously were stronger in the first quarter in part because we took share, so we talked about one point  nearly one point index growth in both the Marriott and Starwood portfolios. And, you know, it would be hard fairly to attribute all of that one point increase to the success of the integration, but I don't at the same time think that it's entirely unrelated to that. And so I think, we are getting a little bit of juice that is coming from bringing these two companies together. At the same time, you know, clearly strength around the world was because of a stronger demand environment as well, so I think the economic  underlying economic situation is also contributing. I can't give you percentages for each. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Right. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. But both are a factor. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Got it and if we're looking at the  what's left of the owned portfolios of the combined company, Leeny, where are we in terms of selling things off and how we should  I heard you that you've guided as though the owned portfolio remains where it is. But what inning or what can you tell us about how much progress you've made, and what we might reasonably expect you to sell in the remainder of the year and into next year? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. I think, David, we continue to be comfortable with the commentary that we've made before about selling over $1.5 billion of real estate by the time we get to the end of 2018. I would also say that we continue to be confident that there will be further asset sales in 2017. Beyond that as I'm sure you know, predicting the exact closing and timing of specific transactions is very hard to do, but I think, we're pleased with the progress, and we're moving along. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Got it. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC Great. Thanks. I wanted to clarify - Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Hi, Robin. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC How are you? Thanks. About group booking comments. It sounded like what you have on the books for the rest of the year, the pace is sort of like North American full-service group is up 1.6%, and I think, last quarter that you had said it was pacing up 3%, but I don't know if I'm using the same exact metric in both cases. So maybe you can  can you talk a little bit about, it sounds like then maybe it did slow in Q1. Just perspective. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah, we were in the high 2%s a quarter ago, and again this is full-service in North America, so it's down about a point. And that's  you know, it's not entirely rare to see us  see those numbers moderate over the course of the year, as in the year group bookings are the only thing that obviously can  or we think, that obviously can raise those numbers. We made a point of explaining in our prepared comments that we think we got about 86% of the group business that we anticipate for the year on the books, and obviously occupancies are running high, which means that we are seeing the booking window lengthen a bit, and we are seeing a bit more growth in limited service group business than in full-service space. At the same time, I think there is still some cautionary  what  something cautionary there about the data. It shows that we've got group customers that are a little reticent to make big commitments, but generally this is pretty healthy. And so on balance, we would say don't be alarmed by it, and we see good growth going forward. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC And just based on how much you have booked for the year, where you're pacing now that up 1.6%, is that where you think the year ends? Or it sounded like you said maybe things could moderate during the year. So just want  is that  does it end up being only up 1%? Or just how do you think about how... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Well, that's probably the best single number we would have at the moment. The  it is kind of a funny year and I think you've heard this from some of the other players. Partly this is because of the holiday schedule and partly it's just the normal vicissitudes of group bookings. But Q1 and Q4 are the strongest quarters of the year, Q2 and Q3 will be a bit weaker and that makes it a little bit hard to forecast all of this stuff. But I would think that, you know, in the high 1s, maybe someplace in that place, would be the best single number we can give you today. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Harry Curtis, Nomura. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet Hey, good morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Good morning, Harry. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, Harry. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet Just following up on that line of questioning, how is the group pace looking for 2018? It's still early, but  and maybe if you can comment on price, as well. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Let's see here. The  we're up in the mid single digits, between 4% and 5% for North American full-service for calendar 2018. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet Okay. And then my second question, just going back to the possible asset sales, I just want to make sure that our assumptions are right. The balance of owned hotels in the Starwood portfolio, is that roughly 5,200 rooms in North America? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Sounds about  in North America, I'll get you the specific numbers, but... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Including Canada, yeah. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Including Canada, that would  sounds about right. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet Okay, and is it reasonable to think that roughly 300 a key is not  is an okay ballpark to be in in terms of its market value? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah, I'm not going there, Harry. Each  each  that's like kind of saying that Tremont in Chicago is the same as the St. Regis in New York is the same as, you know, Toronto Sheraton. You know, they're each one- just like our children, each one is very unique. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet Yeah, well, you know, you've got to throw out the pitch to get a hit. So, yeah, I'll just end it there. Thanks a lot. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hi, thanks. You mentioned the Starwood companies moving over to your the Avendra platform and benefiting from lower OTA fees. And I was just wondering if you could quantify just for sort of the average hotel owner, who's moved now and is enjoying these benefits, do you have a sense of what kind of margin expansion they might be seeing just sort of on average? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Well, first of all, Smedes, I would say so far, very little. So far, in general, this all happened during the first quarter in both cases. So really in terms of Q1 margins, although there's some great work done in benchmarking and working on a host of things across the brand, coming from OTAs and from Avendra, next to nothing. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay, well, maybe then as those things are adapted more, and they have a little more under their belt. Do you have a sense of what it could do for the typical Starwood Hotel? Or legacy Starwood Hotel? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. It's going to vary so tremendously in terms of (32:31) ... Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. ... for OTAs. Because remember that in the U.S. it's going to be very different than overseas, and then again Avendra is largely a U.S.-base and there again if you're a suburban hotel that doesn't have a lot of group versus if you have a ton of group that buys lots of food and beverage, it's going to vary  it's going to really vary tremendously. But I will say, it will definitely, you know, be  it will be noticeable in terms of margins from the benefit, but I wouldn't be able to quantify an average. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. And I just wanted to ask, you mentioned some hotels converting from management to franchise, and it's not  I mean, it's not sort of a thing as my kids would say, is that an issue going forward for Marriott? Are there a lot of options for people just to convert to franchise or is that just something that's sort of, well, kind of a one-off general sort of exception? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. I think, it is a trend we've seen for a number of years and is likely to continue, even as we grow the managed portfolio, particularly globally and in the big-box space with new hotels. I think, in many instances, we've seen some hotels get to the point where they need substantial new capital for renovation. Often they're sold in the context of bringing that new capital in, and there is more capital eager to invest in well-branded assets, well-branded assets that have flexibility on who's running the day-to-day operations, and we have seen that it is in our interests, as well, to make those transactions happen in a way that brings the capital interests, helps to bring them up to standard. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Particularly in North America. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah. And which is very much a North American phenomenon. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. All right. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. It's actually Anthony Powell here for Felicia. How are you guys doing? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Good, how about you? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Hi, Anthony. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc. Doing great. You mentioned that you're seeing better higher rated corporate transient demand. Could you single out any industries that are driving that growth or any particular markets where you're seeing the strength? And also I believe last call you mentioned that you were trying to sign up more corporate contracts. How's that going? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah, I think generally, we are  we feel a bit more encouraged by corporate travel this quarter than we did a quarter ago in the guidance that we provided. But let's be careful about throwing all caution to the wind here. I think you've got, in the corporate travel landscape, lots and lots of different stories. Obviously the energy patch continues to remain relatively weak. In fact I think we were more optimistic about Houston a quarter ago than we are today. We sort of felt like we had hit bottom, and today I think we're a little less confident of that. By comparison, you look at the strength we saw in Washington, you look at the strength that we're seeing still in a number of western markets, we see companies that are reporting better corporate profits and I think as a consequence, we feel a bit better based both on the actual results in Q1, which to be sure was benefited by Easter, but also by sort of what we feel like is tenor in the marketplace. And we have moved more of our transient business, including business transient business, towards retail and to special corporate and away from discount, and so those things are driving a bit of a mix shift within the transient bucket. All good news. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc. Got it, thanks. And on your RevPAR index gain can you attribute any of that to customers allocating more of their travel spend to your system due to the merger or are you just better at selling and getting more groups into the hotels? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Well, I think by definition it means we're getting a bit more of their spend, since we have relatively taken share of the industry. We don't get real time data that would allow us to know exactly how to calculate that, but we are encouraged. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc. All right. Great. That's it for me. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Hi. Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Hi, Patrick. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, Patrick. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Question for you when we're thinking about your North American RevPAR guidance of 1% to 3%. I think, on a previous question you mentioned or indicated that group was sort of in the 1%-ish to 2% range. How do you think about your two other customer segments, the individual business travel and the leisure? Where would they fit in that range? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Maybe Laura or Betsy have got something precise here on that, but generally, I would think that leisure will be the strongest. You obviously have some markets which have got complexities around that answer, because of Zika or because of other trends. And obviously those comparisons will get easier as the year goes along, but generally I think we would say leisure is the strongest. The transient, business transient, is obviously the shortest booking and therefore the area we've got the least visibility into it. But I would think that corporate transient travel would be comparable, maybe a little bit better than group. And those are all North American centric numbers too. When you look around the rest of the world obviously you see different dynamics. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. Can I ask a follow-up question? In your Investor Day, you had talked about some initial steps that you were making with Sheraton identifying sort of the lower-end properties and targeting them first. Can I get a  I'd like to hear a little bit of update on what's  how that's progressing. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah, we are  we're encouraged by the progress we've made so far, and as we talked about at the Analyst Day, we have  we're well underway in conversations with our Sheraton owners and franchisees to make sure that we are getting the input we need to have from them to publish good, detailed brand standards for the Sheraton brand. At the same time, we have looked at both the bottom 25 and then the next bottom 25, so the bottom 50 Sheraton Hotels, and that's by and large relying on guest survey data and what the guests tell us about the way the hotels are being received. We are in discussions probably with 80%  80% to 85% of those owners of those 50 hotels. Nearly half of those 50, renovations are already underway. And we've got another handful or so where we've got plans that are fairly specific that are evolving. And so that gets us to close to 60% or so of those bottom 50 that we've already got good movement on. By the way, of those 60%, there will be 2 or 3 which we already think pretty clearly will leave the system, because it doesn't make sense for us to keep them and for them to get the kind of capital that would be necessary for them to meet brand standards. But all of that gives us encouragement, though this will be a multi-year effort. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay, great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, good morning, everyone. Was wondering if you could just maybe comment a little bit more on the increase to the capital return guidance. So it looks like it moved up fairly substantially versus the last outlook provided. What was the kind of biggest driver, biggest surprise to where you  to what you'd provided kind of earlier? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. So I think the easiest way to think about it, Shaun, is that you have the Westin Maui, which at $317 million at the end of the quarter, definitely gives us more room for the rest of the year, and then you've got the reality that our EBITDA was higher than we expected, and when you think about how you can lever that and use it, it gets you very quickly to $2 billion. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. And then sort of the same question as it relates to the costs and the G&A that came in in the quarter, Leeny, but as we think about the $210 million and you guys clearly said a piece of this is timing and related, but kind of what pieces or what components should start to ramp as we move sequentially through the year? And is there any possibility that ends up being, still being a little bit conservative as we just think about some of the puts and takes of the integration here? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Well, I hope so. That's first and foremost. I hope that's conservative. So the way I would think about it is that about, call it not quite half, of the outperformance, I think, you could argue is timing-related, and really will be spent some time in Q2, Q3, or Q4. But then, also, as you think about the hiring that needs to happen in MEA and Europe from the close-down of that, that was definitely part of what ended up driving the outperformance, and all of that hiring is now ongoing, and so the rest of the quarters won't experience that same gap in openings that were held in Q1. So to make a long story short, we do think, when you put the numbers together, that there is probably a little bit more additional savings as we go through the year, but it's also going to be matched with the timing delays that we had in the spending in Q1. So that's how we really get to taking the beat in Q1, and kind of using that for the full year. The other thing I'll point out is that remember, if you're comparing to combined company results, that that  you have to be careful as we look at that quarter to quarter going through the year, because as we moved through 2016, you were finding that there were people leaving Starwood, so the quarter over quarter comparisons get more difficult. When you look at it the full year, as my comments said, we're comfortable that it will be at least $200 million of the $250 million achieved in 2017. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch And, sorry, last one, but did you ever  had you ever given that $200 million before? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Well, we talked actually at our last call, we talked about thinking that we'd be roughly $185 million of this $250 million that we felt like in 2017. And frankly, now with the beat, I think we're confident that the $200 million is at least a good number for 2017. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC Good morning, everybody. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, Joe. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC Just back to the topic of group and group pace for 2017, when you look at the components of the group pace, is there a big difference between association or large attendance group versus non-association or smaller attendance group? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Short answer is, I don't know. I would  let me just take a peek here at these notes. Looks like, in order of strength, association would be the strongest. Then corporate, and not surprisingly, you get into things like government, government would be weakest. But not a huge gap between them, between association and corporate. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then your earlier comments, in your earlier comments, Arne, you mentioned that financing for new hotel construction is challenging. Are you willing or are you getting requests to invest more in some of these new projects? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. We're not really getting requests to invest in these new projects. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. No. Not meaningfully. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. The bulk of this is about select service franchise development in North America. That is not a place where we have ever really used our balance sheet in a material way, and wouldn't anticipate that that would ever change. I do think, you're not really asking this question, but I'll go ahead and talk about it anyway. I think because of land and construction costs and financing for new builds, I think we're likely to continue to see that 2015 was the sort of peak for signings of select service growth in the United States. And 2016 was obviously strong, as well. I think, 2017 will be strong, but will not be at the same levels that we saw in 2015. And the only way we'll see that ramp back up, I think, would be with definitive proof of a stronger GDP environment, and stronger performance environment, than is even reflected in the guidance that we're giving today. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Hey, good morning, everybody. Just wanted to talk, shift gears a little bit. Can we talk a little bit about Airbnb. I know it's a topic that hasn't come up in a few months. Seems like there's been a lot of regulation over the past few months surrounding Airbnb, whether it be in New York or San Francisco or across Europe or other cities around the world. I'm wondering if you're seeing, if that regulation is giving you confidence in your outlook, or if that regulation is actually starting to impact your numbers or whether you don't have enough visibility into that yet. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You know, it's a good question, Ryan. I think, the answer is that Airbnb and the home-sharing phenomenon has probably been less impactful to the RevPAR numbers that we've posted the last number of years than folks might first have imagined. And similarly, is probably less impactful today even with what's happening on the regulatory side in a number of cities and states. Now, we will continue to analyze this data as much as we possibly can to understand it, but I think by and large, they are serving a mostly different customer than what we serve at Marriott. They are skewed much more towards leisure. They are skewed much more towards a value-centric customer in the bulk of their business, and if their business is under pressure because of a regulatory environment, I'm not sure necessarily that that customer immediately pops up and shows up in our hotel suites. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. That makes sense. And then I guess, you know, as you think about Airbnb and where they might be going, you know, with the regulatory environment limiting their growth, it seems like there might be an avenue for growth as they potentially enter the OTA market with the idea that they've got proprietary inventory coupled with they already have access to that leisure traveler. Has any  is that something you guys have given any thought to, particularly as you're negotiating with the OTAs in terms of trying to get better commission rates given Airbnb's commission rate is so much lower than what you guys typically pay to the Expedias and the Pricelines? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah, well I'm not sure that clearly Airbnb's total rates are all that different when you look at what they charge the host and the guest, and combine those two as transactional costs in the platform, but let's stand back maybe for a minute from Airbnb specifically. Obviously, we have spent a lot of time analyzing our relationship with intermediaries. We are interested in having those relationships work for us, as well as they possibly can, and be as cost effective as they can. That is about of course negotiating our relationships with them regularly when they come up, and fundamentally it's about making sure we got a loyalty program that gives us the power to have a relationship with a huge percentage of our transient guests, particularly. And we've got, you know, continued great news on the loyalty space with not just 100 million members that we talked about at our Analyst Day, but signing up a million a month or more, and we feel really good about the way that's going. None of our hotels as far as I know has a single room on Airbnb. They certainly should not have a room on Airbnb so we are not today looking at that company as an intermediary in a way that's anything similar to the relationships we have with other OTAs around the world. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. All right. That's it for me. Thanks there. Thanks, Arne. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Arne - Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, Bill. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Given all the  all the what you've already chopped on the integration and what lies ahead, I think you talked about a couple of the things out there for next year, where does the biggest risk lie? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah, so the  I think, we're off to a good start on the integration, but I think, we are by no means declaring victory today. We've got a lot of work ahead of us. I think, the team is performing extraordinarily well in getting at that work, and they're incredibly energized by what has been accomplished and what we have to accomplish, and what we think we can achieve by accomplishing it. There are plenty of risks around. I think, if you identify one it's going to be around technology. And we are  you know, it takes longer, it costs more than any of us would like, and I don't think that's unique to Marriott or unique to the hotel business. I think, when you look across the corporate landscape, it is what we see in company after company. And we've got to make sure that we are moving as quickly as we possibly can, because these technology platforms will really allow us to drive, particularly the kind of revenue lift that we think is available, by having one reservations platform and one loyalty platform. And of course, secondarily also allow us to deliver these technology platforms at lower costs to our owners, because we'll be supporting one and not two. And even as we pull those platforms together and do all those things, we want to make sure that we are continuing to innovate and do the kind of new things that our customers expect us to do. So a recent example of that is our investment in PlacePass which is really an online or virtual concierge which helps our customers plan for their trips before going. It's a space that we're very excited about, but we want to make sure our technology platforms allow that to be linked to our loyalty sites and our dotcom sites so that we can drive that business even as we do that and other integration work. So long way of saying technology would be probably the thing that we are maybe most, what, frustrated by the cost, and time associated with it, maybe most fearful about it, but also most convinced that it will drive upside long-term to the performance of the portfolio. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. That's helpful. And then if, as an industry leader, I was wondering if you could give us some comments on a couple of headlines that are out there. The first one is the industry's efforts to lobby Congress regarding Expedia and Priceline. The second one is kind of this airline overbooking news and whether you guys have considered whether you need to make changes to your booking patterns, or, you know, to take away the risk of walk-in guests. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Well, there  those are two hot topics. Thank you for that. The  let's talk about overbooking first. We, about, oh, I don't know, a year and a half ago, two years ago, we expanded the cancellation window for our transient travelers from 6:00 p.m. the day of arrival to midnight the day before arrival, and that was a very useful tool to reduce overbooking. We do have, in a couple of markets today, a few pilots where we're looking at going to midnight of the day before, so that would be sort of like 48 hours before, and there are a number of reasons we're testing that, but I think that could be helpful on overbooking, as well. Obviously, this is  there's nothing worse to it  for a traveler than to show up at a hotel with a confirmed reservation and not have the room there, and so we're trying very  we measure how many times we have to walk a guest. We obviously do pay for that first night if they end up someplace else, but it's still not a great experience. And so that's an area where we continue to put some effort, and obviously we'd like to be at perfection. We'd like to be full every night without a single room empty and without a single customer walked. Now, that's not necessarily something that we will ever achieve, but I think, we're making good progress on that. I don't have much to say about industry efforts on the Hill about OTAs. I'm not sure I know exactly what the AHLA is doing there. I know there have been things over the course of the last year or two years about real transparency. I think that is not so much about what the conduct of the big OTAs has been, but it is conduct of affiliates that pop up and somehow exist under their sites or exist independently, and may not really have the inventory, and so they may be selling rooms to customers who think they've booked a room in one of our hotels or somebody else's hotel and they show up and actually there's no record of that. And that's probably the thing that we want to be most thoughtful about, because even though we have nothing to do with that booking, it reflects poorly on us, because the customer thinks they've booked a room in our hotel. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you for your time. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from David Beckel with Bernstein. Bebe Zhao - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi, thank you for the question. This is Bebe for David. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, Bebe. Bebe Zhao - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. I was just wondering, you've been offering exclusive member rates for over  a little bit over a year now and looking back have the discounts provided the benefits you expected? Do you plan to continue to offer similar levels of member discounts going forward, or do you expect to curtail those over time? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. I think member discounts are here to stay. And the reason I say that is because we are encouraged by what we've seen. And obviously we want to make sure that through the loyalty program, we have the relationship with customers that is  that doesn't require them to sit down and do a spreadsheet calculation to figure out whether it's in their interest to be members of our loyalty program. But instead, where they know without having really to even think about it that if I concentrate my stays with Marriott, I'm going to get  I'm going to get great rooms, I'm going to get points for my stay, I'm going to get free WiFi, I'm going to get mobile services. And I think the member-only rates are a piece of that equation, which again, I think is working, and will continue for the foreseeable future. Bebe Zhao - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hey, thanks for sneaking me in. I've got two quick follow-ups. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Okay. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. First on the net unit growth, what's the breakdown of the pipeline between legacy Starwood and Marriott brands? And how has the pipeline and associated process evolved since the acquisition closed? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Oh, these are good quizzes here, Stephen, at the end. I think the Marriott, legacy Marriott pipeline is proportionately a bit bigger than the legacy Starwood pipeline. So if you think about Marriott and Starwood before closing, Marriott was about twice the size of Starwood, I think in total rooms, 800,000-ish rooms to 400,000-ish rooms. And I think when you look at the pipeline, we're probably, oh, you know, 65%/35%, maybe something like that which would suggest the Marriott pipeline is a little bit bigger, which is not really that surprising. Marriott had many more brands playing in this select service place in the United States than Starwood did, and that's obviously where a number of these rooms in the pipeline from deals signed in 2015, 2016, and currently, are there. In terms of the way the process has changed, there are  there's nothing really revolutionary. I mean I think Starwood used a similar approach to valuing deals that Marriott did. There were some modest difference in the way the incentives worked for the developers. There are  which probably intensify the focus on value as opposed to just rooms, as we go forward. I think, Marriott, too, has had a bit different approach to territorials maybe, and particularly cross-brand territorials in some deals. But I view most of those changes as fairly minor, and, you know, as a consequence we've put the team  the development team was in place globally by the end of calendar 2016. They're working extraordinarily well together, and I think things are going swimmingly. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. That's helpful. And then one other quick clarification. I think it was on Shaun's earlier question on synergies. As you captured a bit more in the first quarter maybe than what you expected, are you finding new opportunities, or is there simply a pull forward of things you had already identified? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. I would say things that we identify, the best I can describe it, Stephen, is maybe in some respects happening a little bit sooner than we had expected. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks so much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Okay. Operator Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC Hey, good morning, everybody. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Hi, Jared. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC Just to ask the group question a little differently. Do you have the number for total group production in the quarter for all future periods? And then have you seen any change in cancellations or attrition? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. The cancellation/attrition story is generally quite positive. So there's less cancellation and attrition than would have been the case in prior periods. Group business, all group bookings in Q1 for all future periods was down modestly in revenue compared to the same time last year. However, last year was up massively from the same measure in 2015 and prior years. So while, obviously, we'd like to be up in every year over and over again, I don't think that the modest decline in revenue on the books in Q1 for all future periods is that concerning. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then, Arne, I think in the past, you used to provide the percentage of your North American hotels that were currently earning IMFs. Do you have that number? And where do you see the next direction for that number? Do you think it will be up or down? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. I've actually got it, Stephen (sic) [Jared] (1:02:10). And if we're looking at the percentage, in the first quarter, we're looking at 60% in the total portfolio with about 47% in North America, as compared to a year ago, very similar worldwide. It's about 61%. This is on a combined basis. So this is for both companies. And I think in general, there's a very slight difference between a year ago and this year first quarter, and that's a result of one portfolio of limited service hotels that was barely in the money a year ago Q1 and was not in the money in Q1. Though, to be honest, we expect them to be in the money in IMF this year and 2017, so we'd expect it to kind of get back to where it was for the whole company. The only comment I would make where we see it going is that clearly with international, with the growth in the Asia Pacific portfolio which tends not to have owners' priority, as you might imagine, that is weighing more and more into the percentage of hotels earning incentive fees. While in the U.S., when you've got a midpoint RevPAR of 2%, it's very difficult to hold onto margins or increase them very much relative to earning more incentive fees. So, overall, if we continue to see this kind of RevPAR environment, you might actually year-over-year see North America's percentage not growing, but international continuing to grow. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. Thank you very much for the time. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, good morning, everyone. With the comment about group space being more limited now, are you seeing opportunity to up-mix the group for next year? I guess increasing the stands for more F&B spend on that side? And then on the corporate side, can you give an update of your top 300 customers demand from that segment and are you seeing a difference between select service and the full service hotels? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You said top 200 customers? What did you say? Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC Top 300. I believe you guys give that statistic every so often. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Top 300. Well, that's news to me. On the group, generally, yes. I mean I think we are more focused on food and beverage and ancillary spend because of the volume we've got of group business, and I think that will continue to be the case as long as group business on the books remains strong. And I think the top 300 accounts generally are in positive shape. Now, we've got a sort of plus 4%-ish for Q1 for the top 300 accounts, but remember there we get the benefit of Easter, so March was meaningfully stronger this year than last year for business travel, because we didn't have that holiday. And I think that includes the group business as well, which is also primarily related to the calendar. But still net-net, again, it's a bit why we are encouraged on our expectations for the balance of the year. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. And then between the full service hotels and select service hotels, we're seeing a lot of supply on the select service but demand seems quite strong as well. So I wonder if the business traveler for select service is doing a little bit better than the full service. Can you comment on that? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. I think they're both actually performing quite well. And if you look at the RevPAR numbers which we published by brand. You'll see that the full-service hotels performed extraordinarily well in Q1. I think the select service portfolio was strong, though, too. And I think that's a sign that demand generally was strong in the quarter. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks. Most of my questions were answered. But if I could, just on the incentive fee front, when you guys think about some of the changes that you've made with the Starwood portfolio, including getting them on your pre-negotiated OTA rate and improving the RevPAR index, is there an opportunity there to see any kind of meaningful push in incentive fees? And what's the timeline on when we would start to see some of those thresholds be met? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. So I would say a little too soon to talk about a real analysis of changes in exactly what may be going on with the threshold, particularly as we're really just getting going at putting synergies into place and working through all the portfolios. As you did see, our incentive fee forecast for the year, we've clearly moved up nicely relative to where we were in February. And so from that standpoint, as a result of the strong margin work that is going across in the combined portfolio, we actually had strong IMF outperformance in both Asia Pacific and in North America across the portfolios, so kind of great work across legacy portfolios. It's also worth mentioning that they have a much bigger share of incentive fees that are outside the U.S. and Asia Pacific, which obviously every dollar of RevPAR you get a certain share of that with no owner's priority. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Great. Thank you, Leeny. That's helpful. And then, if I could, if you guys  and let's just talk about the $880 million to $890 million range. If you're in that range this year, we would assume that you've kind of hit the $200 million number you referenced earlier. If we think about the incremental $50 million, do we kind of layer that in in 2018 and then assume some form of growth on the just core inflation within the SG&A line? Is that kind of how you're shaping it now for 2018? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah. No, I think that's exactly right. I think we'll, obviously, be able to talk a bit more as we get further into the year about 2018. The biggest variable there is about wind-down costs, about how we work our way through making sure that, for example, we're combining the ledgers on the two companies, et cetera, and all of that we're kind of working our way through. I think as we've described it before, we've really talked about the $250 million, we would expect to really feel comfortable that it's kind of more in the latter part of 2018 that when you look at it on a quarterly run rate basis, you see it. But your general approach in terms of inflation with continued savings is right. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Great. That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Good morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Good morning. Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Bigger picture capital allocation question for you. Stock's at 15 times EBITDA. The market clearly likes buybacks, but when do those buybacks become less attractive, especially as you think about other tuck-in acquisitions or investment opportunities within the portfolio that might have better returns? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Great question. We look at it all the time. Certainly, first and foremost, we want to be investing in our business in value accretive ways. And whether that is by a contract, by a loan, by a brand acquisition, no matter how we look at it, first and foremost, we want to grow our business. But the reality is we've got a model that generates far more than we need to invest in our business, and we continue to be, as you can tell, from our share repurchase to date, we continue to feel great about returning our shareholders in kind of the balance that we're doing across a combination of dividends and share repurchase. Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. So as a follow-up, are you not seeing those other opportunities, or buyback still make sense at 15 times earnings? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. No, no, no, we're seeing opportunities, but as I was describing, our model, the reality, the $500 million to $700 million that we've described and the need to basically continue to grow our business that's in the model and we continue to expect to spend that. And to the extent there are other things that come along, we absolutely take a look at them. Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Fair enough. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC Great. Thanks. I wanted to circle back on April. I think you noted it was running up 2%. I'm curious how much of a headwind Easter was to April, and heading into the quarter... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Vince, make sure you heard the data. Year-to-date, April was 2%. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC Got it. So I was curious, how much of a headwind you thought Easter would be to April? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Easter will be a headwind to April. And we don't have final numbers yet for April. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. But for... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. It will be a headwind for April and it will be a headwind for Q2. I would think that it's nearly 1 point positive to Q1 and nearly 1 point negative to Q2. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. That's right. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. And please take that as directional because we don't even have final April numbers yet. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC Helpful, thanks. And then also just thinking about demand and specifically related to the occupancy gains, I think 1Q showed some nice growth and I'm curious within your full year budget how much you're thinking occupancy will play into it and if you think occupancy will be positive in 2017. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Globally I would think it will be positive, but I think in North America, much more likely to have RevPAR driven by rate as opposed to occupancy I think as the year goes along. Hotels are practically already quite full, and of course, it will depend a little bit quarter by quarter based on the holidays, but the contribution should be more rate-driven. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC Great. Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Telsey Group. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Thank you for allowing me back in. I just wanted to ask... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Are you back for more? David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC I'm back for more, first and last. It was some psychological theory I learned a million years ago... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. There you ago. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC ...primacy and recency. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. There you go. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC But, as we go through the model and we update all of the portfolio of brands, are there any updated thoughts about the range of brands? And, quite frankly, it seems like a lot, a long laundry list of brands, and how sustainable that can be over the very long term? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. No. We are thrilled by the number of brands we have and the range of choice that we can give to our customers, as we've spent obviously time talking about this at the Analyst Conference. There's no different thinking today than we laid out then. And we can all look at our 30 brands and our 1.2 million hotel rooms and say that's a lot, but it's nothing compared to the range of choice that's offered by the third-party intermediaries. And offering more choice to our customers is a great thing. And as a consequence, you should presume that we will continue with these brands and that our effort will not be about getting to fewer brands, but instead getting to emphasize the distinctions between brands and make sure we are driving the compliance, if you will, or the consistency of product quality and service quality so that the customers are experiencing something which is consistent with what each of those brands stand for. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Appreciate it. Thank you for letting me back in. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our final question in queue today is a follow-up from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, Joe. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Joe? Operator Joe, if you're on mute... Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC Can you hear me, guys? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Now we can. There you go. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC All right. Obviously intuitively for the third quarter in a row, merger related costs decreased on a sequential basis. How much anticipated merger-related costs do you have for the balance of this year? And would you expect that to continue to go down on a sequential basis? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. I think the best I could say, Joe, right now is that we have to look at this as we keep moving along and getting through integration. So we don't have a final number for you. I think over $100 million in 2017 is the right expectation. Obviously we've already had $51 million in Q1, so that would kind of argue that we'll continue to move through the year, but exactly where we end up, whether it's $100 million or a bit more, it's too soon to say. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC And the $100 million that you're talking about would be on a pre-tax not post-tax basis? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Yes. That's a pre-tax basis, right. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great. Thanks. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Okay. Well, thank you all very much for your participation and your interest in the Marriott story. We'd love to welcome you into our hotels as you travel around the world. Talk to you soon.

Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, David. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Thank you. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC I wanted to just probe a little bit more about the guidance, and I know you've given quite a bit of detail around a lot of things, but if I'm trying to balance between your perspective on the economic climate taken in total for the remainder of the year versus the execution of the integration and just the execution of the business combination, how much of your improvement today would you say you would allocate to both? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Oh, that's a good question. And I'm not sure we've necessarily broken it down that way in our internal calculations, although clearly, as we've noted, the driving  the most significant driving factors in our increase in our RevPAR guidance was the strength of the first quarter, including in North America and the rest of the world, and the momentum that's particularly occurring in Europe and Asia-Pacific. The U.S. results, North American results, as well as the global results, obviously were stronger in the first quarter in part because we took share, so we talked about one point  nearly one point index growth in both the Marriott and Starwood portfolios. And, you know, it would be hard fairly to attribute all of that one point increase to the success of the integration, but I don't at the same time think that it's entirely unrelated to that. And so I think, we are getting a little bit of juice that is coming from bringing these two companies together. At the same time, you know, clearly strength around the world was because of a stronger demand environment as well, so I think the economic  underlying economic situation is also contributing. I can't give you percentages for each. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Right. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. But both are a factor. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Got it and if we're looking at the  what's left of the owned portfolios of the combined company, Leeny, where are we in terms of selling things off and how we should  I heard you that you've guided as though the owned portfolio remains where it is. But what inning or what can you tell us about how much progress you've made, and what we might reasonably expect you to sell in the remainder of the year and into next year? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. I think, David, we continue to be comfortable with the commentary that we've made before about selling over $1.5 billion of real estate by the time we get to the end of 2018. I would also say that we continue to be confident that there will be further asset sales in 2017. Beyond that as I'm sure you know, predicting the exact closing and timing of specific transactions is very hard to do, but I think, we're pleased with the progress, and we're moving along. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Got it. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC Great. Thanks. I wanted to clarify - Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Hi, Robin. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC How are you? Thanks. About group booking comments. It sounded like what you have on the books for the rest of the year, the pace is sort of like North American full-service group is up 1.6%, and I think, last quarter that you had said it was pacing up 3%, but I don't know if I'm using the same exact metric in both cases. So maybe you can  can you talk a little bit about, it sounds like then maybe it did slow in Q1. Just perspective. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah, we were in the high 2%s a quarter ago, and again this is full-service in North America, so it's down about a point. And that's  you know, it's not entirely rare to see us  see those numbers moderate over the course of the year, as in the year group bookings are the only thing that obviously can  or we think, that obviously can raise those numbers. We made a point of explaining in our prepared comments that we think we got about 86% of the group business that we anticipate for the year on the books, and obviously occupancies are running high, which means that we are seeing the booking window lengthen a bit, and we are seeing a bit more growth in limited service group business than in full-service space. At the same time, I think there is still some cautionary  what  something cautionary there about the data. It shows that we've got group customers that are a little reticent to make big commitments, but generally this is pretty healthy. And so on balance, we would say don't be alarmed by it, and we see good growth going forward. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC And just based on how much you have booked for the year, where you're pacing now that up 1.6%, is that where you think the year ends? Or it sounded like you said maybe things could moderate during the year. So just want  is that  does it end up being only up 1%? Or just how do you think about how... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Well, that's probably the best single number we would have at the moment. The  it is kind of a funny year and I think you've heard this from some of the other players. Partly this is because of the holiday schedule and partly it's just the normal vicissitudes of group bookings. But Q1 and Q4 are the strongest quarters of the year, Q2 and Q3 will be a bit weaker and that makes it a little bit hard to forecast all of this stuff. But I would think that, you know, in the high 1s, maybe someplace in that place, would be the best single number we can give you today. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Harry Curtis, Nomura. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet Hey, good morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Good morning, Harry. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, Harry. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet Just following up on that line of questioning, how is the group pace looking for 2018? It's still early, but  and maybe if you can comment on price, as well. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Let's see here. The  we're up in the mid single digits, between 4% and 5% for North American full-service for calendar 2018. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet Okay. And then my second question, just going back to the possible asset sales, I just want to make sure that our assumptions are right. The balance of owned hotels in the Starwood portfolio, is that roughly 5,200 rooms in North America? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Sounds about  in North America, I'll get you the specific numbers, but... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Including Canada, yeah. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Including Canada, that would  sounds about right. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet Okay, and is it reasonable to think that roughly 300 a key is not  is an okay ballpark to be in in terms of its market value? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah, I'm not going there, Harry. Each  each  that's like kind of saying that Tremont in Chicago is the same as the St. Regis in New York is the same as, you know, Toronto Sheraton. You know, they're each one- just like our children, each one is very unique. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet Yeah, well, you know, you've got to throw out the pitch to get a hit. So, yeah, I'll just end it there. Thanks a lot. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hi, thanks. You mentioned the Starwood companies moving over to your the Avendra platform and benefiting from lower OTA fees. And I was just wondering if you could quantify just for sort of the average hotel owner, who's moved now and is enjoying these benefits, do you have a sense of what kind of margin expansion they might be seeing just sort of on average? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Well, first of all, Smedes, I would say so far, very little. So far, in general, this all happened during the first quarter in both cases. So really in terms of Q1 margins, although there's some great work done in benchmarking and working on a host of things across the brand, coming from OTAs and from Avendra, next to nothing. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay, well, maybe then as those things are adapted more, and they have a little more under their belt. Do you have a sense of what it could do for the typical Starwood Hotel? Or legacy Starwood Hotel? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. It's going to vary so tremendously in terms of (32:31) ... Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. ... for OTAs. Because remember that in the U.S. it's going to be very different than overseas, and then again Avendra is largely a U.S.-base and there again if you're a suburban hotel that doesn't have a lot of group versus if you have a ton of group that buys lots of food and beverage, it's going to vary  it's going to really vary tremendously. But I will say, it will definitely, you know, be  it will be noticeable in terms of margins from the benefit, but I wouldn't be able to quantify an average. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. And I just wanted to ask, you mentioned some hotels converting from management to franchise, and it's not  I mean, it's not sort of a thing as my kids would say, is that an issue going forward for Marriott? Are there a lot of options for people just to convert to franchise or is that just something that's sort of, well, kind of a one-off general sort of exception? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. I think, it is a trend we've seen for a number of years and is likely to continue, even as we grow the managed portfolio, particularly globally and in the big-box space with new hotels. I think, in many instances, we've seen some hotels get to the point where they need substantial new capital for renovation. Often they're sold in the context of bringing that new capital in, and there is more capital eager to invest in well-branded assets, well-branded assets that have flexibility on who's running the day-to-day operations, and we have seen that it is in our interests, as well, to make those transactions happen in a way that brings the capital interests, helps to bring them up to standard. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Particularly in North America. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah. And which is very much a North American phenomenon. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. All right. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. It's actually Anthony Powell here for Felicia. How are you guys doing? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Good, how about you? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Hi, Anthony. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc. Doing great. You mentioned that you're seeing better higher rated corporate transient demand. Could you single out any industries that are driving that growth or any particular markets where you're seeing the strength? And also I believe last call you mentioned that you were trying to sign up more corporate contracts. How's that going? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah, I think generally, we are  we feel a bit more encouraged by corporate travel this quarter than we did a quarter ago in the guidance that we provided. But let's be careful about throwing all caution to the wind here. I think you've got, in the corporate travel landscape, lots and lots of different stories. Obviously the energy patch continues to remain relatively weak. In fact I think we were more optimistic about Houston a quarter ago than we are today. We sort of felt like we had hit bottom, and today I think we're a little less confident of that. By comparison, you look at the strength we saw in Washington, you look at the strength that we're seeing still in a number of western markets, we see companies that are reporting better corporate profits and I think as a consequence, we feel a bit better based both on the actual results in Q1, which to be sure was benefited by Easter, but also by sort of what we feel like is tenor in the marketplace. And we have moved more of our transient business, including business transient business, towards retail and to special corporate and away from discount, and so those things are driving a bit of a mix shift within the transient bucket. All good news. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc. Got it, thanks. And on your RevPAR index gain can you attribute any of that to customers allocating more of their travel spend to your system due to the merger or are you just better at selling and getting more groups into the hotels? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Well, I think by definition it means we're getting a bit more of their spend, since we have relatively taken share of the industry. We don't get real time data that would allow us to know exactly how to calculate that, but we are encouraged. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc. All right. Great. That's it for me. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Hi. Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Hi, Patrick. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, Patrick. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Question for you when we're thinking about your North American RevPAR guidance of 1% to 3%. I think, on a previous question you mentioned or indicated that group was sort of in the 1%-ish to 2% range. How do you think about your two other customer segments, the individual business travel and the leisure? Where would they fit in that range? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Maybe Laura or Betsy have got something precise here on that, but generally, I would think that leisure will be the strongest. You obviously have some markets which have got complexities around that answer, because of Zika or because of other trends. And obviously those comparisons will get easier as the year goes along, but generally I think we would say leisure is the strongest. The transient, business transient, is obviously the shortest booking and therefore the area we've got the least visibility into it. But I would think that corporate transient travel would be comparable, maybe a little bit better than group. And those are all North American centric numbers too. When you look around the rest of the world obviously you see different dynamics. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. Can I ask a follow-up question? In your Investor Day, you had talked about some initial steps that you were making with Sheraton identifying sort of the lower-end properties and targeting them first. Can I get a  I'd like to hear a little bit of update on what's  how that's progressing. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah, we are  we're encouraged by the progress we've made so far, and as we talked about at the Analyst Day, we have  we're well underway in conversations with our Sheraton owners and franchisees to make sure that we are getting the input we need to have from them to publish good, detailed brand standards for the Sheraton brand. At the same time, we have looked at both the bottom 25 and then the next bottom 25, so the bottom 50 Sheraton Hotels, and that's by and large relying on guest survey data and what the guests tell us about the way the hotels are being received. We are in discussions probably with 80%  80% to 85% of those owners of those 50 hotels. Nearly half of those 50, renovations are already underway. And we've got another handful or so where we've got plans that are fairly specific that are evolving. And so that gets us to close to 60% or so of those bottom 50 that we've already got good movement on. By the way, of those 60%, there will be 2 or 3 which we already think pretty clearly will leave the system, because it doesn't make sense for us to keep them and for them to get the kind of capital that would be necessary for them to meet brand standards. But all of that gives us encouragement, though this will be a multi-year effort. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay, great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, good morning, everyone. Was wondering if you could just maybe comment a little bit more on the increase to the capital return guidance. So it looks like it moved up fairly substantially versus the last outlook provided. What was the kind of biggest driver, biggest surprise to where you  to what you'd provided kind of earlier? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. So I think the easiest way to think about it, Shaun, is that you have the Westin Maui, which at $317 million at the end of the quarter, definitely gives us more room for the rest of the year, and then you've got the reality that our EBITDA was higher than we expected, and when you think about how you can lever that and use it, it gets you very quickly to $2 billion. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. And then sort of the same question as it relates to the costs and the G&A that came in in the quarter, Leeny, but as we think about the $210 million and you guys clearly said a piece of this is timing and related, but kind of what pieces or what components should start to ramp as we move sequentially through the year? And is there any possibility that ends up being, still being a little bit conservative as we just think about some of the puts and takes of the integration here? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Well, I hope so. That's first and foremost. I hope that's conservative. So the way I would think about it is that about, call it not quite half, of the outperformance, I think, you could argue is timing-related, and really will be spent some time in Q2, Q3, or Q4. But then, also, as you think about the hiring that needs to happen in MEA and Europe from the close-down of that, that was definitely part of what ended up driving the outperformance, and all of that hiring is now ongoing, and so the rest of the quarters won't experience that same gap in openings that were held in Q1. So to make a long story short, we do think, when you put the numbers together, that there is probably a little bit more additional savings as we go through the year, but it's also going to be matched with the timing delays that we had in the spending in Q1. So that's how we really get to taking the beat in Q1, and kind of using that for the full year. The other thing I'll point out is that remember, if you're comparing to combined company results, that that  you have to be careful as we look at that quarter to quarter going through the year, because as we moved through 2016, you were finding that there were people leaving Starwood, so the quarter over quarter comparisons get more difficult. When you look at it the full year, as my comments said, we're comfortable that it will be at least $200 million of the $250 million achieved in 2017. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch And, sorry, last one, but did you ever  had you ever given that $200 million before? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Well, we talked actually at our last call, we talked about thinking that we'd be roughly $185 million of this $250 million that we felt like in 2017. And frankly, now with the beat, I think we're confident that the $200 million is at least a good number for 2017. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC Good morning, everybody. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, Joe. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC Just back to the topic of group and group pace for 2017, when you look at the components of the group pace, is there a big difference between association or large attendance group versus non-association or smaller attendance group? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Short answer is, I don't know. I would  let me just take a peek here at these notes. Looks like, in order of strength, association would be the strongest. Then corporate, and not surprisingly, you get into things like government, government would be weakest. But not a huge gap between them, between association and corporate. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then your earlier comments, in your earlier comments, Arne, you mentioned that financing for new hotel construction is challenging. Are you willing or are you getting requests to invest more in some of these new projects? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. We're not really getting requests to invest in these new projects. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. No. Not meaningfully. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. The bulk of this is about select service franchise development in North America. That is not a place where we have ever really used our balance sheet in a material way, and wouldn't anticipate that that would ever change. I do think, you're not really asking this question, but I'll go ahead and talk about it anyway. I think because of land and construction costs and financing for new builds, I think we're likely to continue to see that 2015 was the sort of peak for signings of select service growth in the United States. And 2016 was obviously strong, as well. I think, 2017 will be strong, but will not be at the same levels that we saw in 2015. And the only way we'll see that ramp back up, I think, would be with definitive proof of a stronger GDP environment, and stronger performance environment, than is even reflected in the guidance that we're giving today. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Hey, good morning, everybody. Just wanted to talk, shift gears a little bit. Can we talk a little bit about Airbnb. I know it's a topic that hasn't come up in a few months. Seems like there's been a lot of regulation over the past few months surrounding Airbnb, whether it be in New York or San Francisco or across Europe or other cities around the world. I'm wondering if you're seeing, if that regulation is giving you confidence in your outlook, or if that regulation is actually starting to impact your numbers or whether you don't have enough visibility into that yet. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You know, it's a good question, Ryan. I think, the answer is that Airbnb and the home-sharing phenomenon has probably been less impactful to the RevPAR numbers that we've posted the last number of years than folks might first have imagined. And similarly, is probably less impactful today even with what's happening on the regulatory side in a number of cities and states. Now, we will continue to analyze this data as much as we possibly can to understand it, but I think by and large, they are serving a mostly different customer than what we serve at Marriott. They are skewed much more towards leisure. They are skewed much more towards a value-centric customer in the bulk of their business, and if their business is under pressure because of a regulatory environment, I'm not sure necessarily that that customer immediately pops up and shows up in our hotel suites. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. That makes sense. And then I guess, you know, as you think about Airbnb and where they might be going, you know, with the regulatory environment limiting their growth, it seems like there might be an avenue for growth as they potentially enter the OTA market with the idea that they've got proprietary inventory coupled with they already have access to that leisure traveler. Has any  is that something you guys have given any thought to, particularly as you're negotiating with the OTAs in terms of trying to get better commission rates given Airbnb's commission rate is so much lower than what you guys typically pay to the Expedias and the Pricelines? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah, well I'm not sure that clearly Airbnb's total rates are all that different when you look at what they charge the host and the guest, and combine those two as transactional costs in the platform, but let's stand back maybe for a minute from Airbnb specifically. Obviously, we have spent a lot of time analyzing our relationship with intermediaries. We are interested in having those relationships work for us, as well as they possibly can, and be as cost effective as they can. That is about of course negotiating our relationships with them regularly when they come up, and fundamentally it's about making sure we got a loyalty program that gives us the power to have a relationship with a huge percentage of our transient guests, particularly. And we've got, you know, continued great news on the loyalty space with not just 100 million members that we talked about at our Analyst Day, but signing up a million a month or more, and we feel really good about the way that's going. None of our hotels as far as I know has a single room on Airbnb. They certainly should not have a room on Airbnb so we are not today looking at that company as an intermediary in a way that's anything similar to the relationships we have with other OTAs around the world. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. All right. That's it for me. Thanks there. Thanks, Arne. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Arne - Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, Bill. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Given all the  all the what you've already chopped on the integration and what lies ahead, I think you talked about a couple of the things out there for next year, where does the biggest risk lie? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah, so the  I think, we're off to a good start on the integration, but I think, we are by no means declaring victory today. We've got a lot of work ahead of us. I think, the team is performing extraordinarily well in getting at that work, and they're incredibly energized by what has been accomplished and what we have to accomplish, and what we think we can achieve by accomplishing it. There are plenty of risks around. I think, if you identify one it's going to be around technology. And we are  you know, it takes longer, it costs more than any of us would like, and I don't think that's unique to Marriott or unique to the hotel business. I think, when you look across the corporate landscape, it is what we see in company after company. And we've got to make sure that we are moving as quickly as we possibly can, because these technology platforms will really allow us to drive, particularly the kind of revenue lift that we think is available, by having one reservations platform and one loyalty platform. And of course, secondarily also allow us to deliver these technology platforms at lower costs to our owners, because we'll be supporting one and not two. And even as we pull those platforms together and do all those things, we want to make sure that we are continuing to innovate and do the kind of new things that our customers expect us to do. So a recent example of that is our investment in PlacePass which is really an online or virtual concierge which helps our customers plan for their trips before going. It's a space that we're very excited about, but we want to make sure our technology platforms allow that to be linked to our loyalty sites and our dotcom sites so that we can drive that business even as we do that and other integration work. So long way of saying technology would be probably the thing that we are maybe most, what, frustrated by the cost, and time associated with it, maybe most fearful about it, but also most convinced that it will drive upside long-term to the performance of the portfolio. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. That's helpful. And then if, as an industry leader, I was wondering if you could give us some comments on a couple of headlines that are out there. The first one is the industry's efforts to lobby Congress regarding Expedia and Priceline. The second one is kind of this airline overbooking news and whether you guys have considered whether you need to make changes to your booking patterns, or, you know, to take away the risk of walk-in guests. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Well, there  those are two hot topics. Thank you for that. The  let's talk about overbooking first. We, about, oh, I don't know, a year and a half ago, two years ago, we expanded the cancellation window for our transient travelers from 6:00 p.m. the day of arrival to midnight the day before arrival, and that was a very useful tool to reduce overbooking. We do have, in a couple of markets today, a few pilots where we're looking at going to midnight of the day before, so that would be sort of like 48 hours before, and there are a number of reasons we're testing that, but I think that could be helpful on overbooking, as well. Obviously, this is  there's nothing worse to it  for a traveler than to show up at a hotel with a confirmed reservation and not have the room there, and so we're trying very  we measure how many times we have to walk a guest. We obviously do pay for that first night if they end up someplace else, but it's still not a great experience. And so that's an area where we continue to put some effort, and obviously we'd like to be at perfection. We'd like to be full every night without a single room empty and without a single customer walked. Now, that's not necessarily something that we will ever achieve, but I think, we're making good progress on that. I don't have much to say about industry efforts on the Hill about OTAs. I'm not sure I know exactly what the AHLA is doing there. I know there have been things over the course of the last year or two years about real transparency. I think that is not so much about what the conduct of the big OTAs has been, but it is conduct of affiliates that pop up and somehow exist under their sites or exist independently, and may not really have the inventory, and so they may be selling rooms to customers who think they've booked a room in one of our hotels or somebody else's hotel and they show up and actually there's no record of that. And that's probably the thing that we want to be most thoughtful about, because even though we have nothing to do with that booking, it reflects poorly on us, because the customer thinks they've booked a room in our hotel. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you for your time. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from David Beckel with Bernstein. Bebe Zhao - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi, thank you for the question. This is Bebe for David. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, Bebe. Bebe Zhao - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. I was just wondering, you've been offering exclusive member rates for over  a little bit over a year now and looking back have the discounts provided the benefits you expected? Do you plan to continue to offer similar levels of member discounts going forward, or do you expect to curtail those over time? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. I think member discounts are here to stay. And the reason I say that is because we are encouraged by what we've seen. And obviously we want to make sure that through the loyalty program, we have the relationship with customers that is  that doesn't require them to sit down and do a spreadsheet calculation to figure out whether it's in their interest to be members of our loyalty program. But instead, where they know without having really to even think about it that if I concentrate my stays with Marriott, I'm going to get  I'm going to get great rooms, I'm going to get points for my stay, I'm going to get free WiFi, I'm going to get mobile services. And I think the member-only rates are a piece of that equation, which again, I think is working, and will continue for the foreseeable future. Bebe Zhao - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hey, thanks for sneaking me in. I've got two quick follow-ups. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Okay. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. First on the net unit growth, what's the breakdown of the pipeline between legacy Starwood and Marriott brands? And how has the pipeline and associated process evolved since the acquisition closed? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Oh, these are good quizzes here, Stephen, at the end. I think the Marriott, legacy Marriott pipeline is proportionately a bit bigger than the legacy Starwood pipeline. So if you think about Marriott and Starwood before closing, Marriott was about twice the size of Starwood, I think in total rooms, 800,000-ish rooms to 400,000-ish rooms. And I think when you look at the pipeline, we're probably, oh, you know, 65%/35%, maybe something like that which would suggest the Marriott pipeline is a little bit bigger, which is not really that surprising. Marriott had many more brands playing in this select service place in the United States than Starwood did, and that's obviously where a number of these rooms in the pipeline from deals signed in 2015, 2016, and currently, are there. In terms of the way the process has changed, there are  there's nothing really revolutionary. I mean I think Starwood used a similar approach to valuing deals that Marriott did. There were some modest difference in the way the incentives worked for the developers. There are  which probably intensify the focus on value as opposed to just rooms, as we go forward. I think, Marriott, too, has had a bit different approach to territorials maybe, and particularly cross-brand territorials in some deals. But I view most of those changes as fairly minor, and, you know, as a consequence we've put the team  the development team was in place globally by the end of calendar 2016. They're working extraordinarily well together, and I think things are going swimmingly. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. That's helpful. And then one other quick clarification. I think it was on Shaun's earlier question on synergies. As you captured a bit more in the first quarter maybe than what you expected, are you finding new opportunities, or is there simply a pull forward of things you had already identified? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. I would say things that we identify, the best I can describe it, Stephen, is maybe in some respects happening a little bit sooner than we had expected. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks so much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Okay. Operator Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC Hey, good morning, everybody. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Hi, Jared. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC Just to ask the group question a little differently. Do you have the number for total group production in the quarter for all future periods? And then have you seen any change in cancellations or attrition? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. The cancellation/attrition story is generally quite positive. So there's less cancellation and attrition than would have been the case in prior periods. Group business, all group bookings in Q1 for all future periods was down modestly in revenue compared to the same time last year. However, last year was up massively from the same measure in 2015 and prior years. So while, obviously, we'd like to be up in every year over and over again, I don't think that the modest decline in revenue on the books in Q1 for all future periods is that concerning. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then, Arne, I think in the past, you used to provide the percentage of your North American hotels that were currently earning IMFs. Do you have that number? And where do you see the next direction for that number? Do you think it will be up or down? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. I've actually got it, Stephen (sic) [Jared] (1:02:10). And if we're looking at the percentage, in the first quarter, we're looking at 60% in the total portfolio with about 47% in North America, as compared to a year ago, very similar worldwide. It's about 61%. This is on a combined basis. So this is for both companies. And I think in general, there's a very slight difference between a year ago and this year first quarter, and that's a result of one portfolio of limited service hotels that was barely in the money a year ago Q1 and was not in the money in Q1. Though, to be honest, we expect them to be in the money in IMF this year and 2017, so we'd expect it to kind of get back to where it was for the whole company. The only comment I would make where we see it going is that clearly with international, with the growth in the Asia Pacific portfolio which tends not to have owners' priority, as you might imagine, that is weighing more and more into the percentage of hotels earning incentive fees. While in the U.S., when you've got a midpoint RevPAR of 2%, it's very difficult to hold onto margins or increase them very much relative to earning more incentive fees. So, overall, if we continue to see this kind of RevPAR environment, you might actually year-over-year see North America's percentage not growing, but international continuing to grow. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. Thank you very much for the time. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, good morning, everyone. With the comment about group space being more limited now, are you seeing opportunity to up-mix the group for next year? I guess increasing the stands for more F&B spend on that side? And then on the corporate side, can you give an update of your top 300 customers demand from that segment and are you seeing a difference between select service and the full service hotels? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You said top 200 customers? What did you say? Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC Top 300. I believe you guys give that statistic every so often. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Top 300. Well, that's news to me. On the group, generally, yes. I mean I think we are more focused on food and beverage and ancillary spend because of the volume we've got of group business, and I think that will continue to be the case as long as group business on the books remains strong. And I think the top 300 accounts generally are in positive shape. Now, we've got a sort of plus 4%-ish for Q1 for the top 300 accounts, but remember there we get the benefit of Easter, so March was meaningfully stronger this year than last year for business travel, because we didn't have that holiday. And I think that includes the group business as well, which is also primarily related to the calendar. But still net-net, again, it's a bit why we are encouraged on our expectations for the balance of the year. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. And then between the full service hotels and select service hotels, we're seeing a lot of supply on the select service but demand seems quite strong as well. So I wonder if the business traveler for select service is doing a little bit better than the full service. Can you comment on that? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. I think they're both actually performing quite well. And if you look at the RevPAR numbers which we published by brand. You'll see that the full-service hotels performed extraordinarily well in Q1. I think the select service portfolio was strong, though, too. And I think that's a sign that demand generally was strong in the quarter. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks. Most of my questions were answered. But if I could, just on the incentive fee front, when you guys think about some of the changes that you've made with the Starwood portfolio, including getting them on your pre-negotiated OTA rate and improving the RevPAR index, is there an opportunity there to see any kind of meaningful push in incentive fees? And what's the timeline on when we would start to see some of those thresholds be met? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. So I would say a little too soon to talk about a real analysis of changes in exactly what may be going on with the threshold, particularly as we're really just getting going at putting synergies into place and working through all the portfolios. As you did see, our incentive fee forecast for the year, we've clearly moved up nicely relative to where we were in February. And so from that standpoint, as a result of the strong margin work that is going across in the combined portfolio, we actually had strong IMF outperformance in both Asia Pacific and in North America across the portfolios, so kind of great work across legacy portfolios. It's also worth mentioning that they have a much bigger share of incentive fees that are outside the U.S. and Asia Pacific, which obviously every dollar of RevPAR you get a certain share of that with no owner's priority. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Great. Thank you, Leeny. That's helpful. And then, if I could, if you guys  and let's just talk about the $880 million to $890 million range. If you're in that range this year, we would assume that you've kind of hit the $200 million number you referenced earlier. If we think about the incremental $50 million, do we kind of layer that in in 2018 and then assume some form of growth on the just core inflation within the SG&A line? Is that kind of how you're shaping it now for 2018? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah. No, I think that's exactly right. I think we'll, obviously, be able to talk a bit more as we get further into the year about 2018. The biggest variable there is about wind-down costs, about how we work our way through making sure that, for example, we're combining the ledgers on the two companies, et cetera, and all of that we're kind of working our way through. I think as we've described it before, we've really talked about the $250 million, we would expect to really feel comfortable that it's kind of more in the latter part of 2018 that when you look at it on a quarterly run rate basis, you see it. But your general approach in terms of inflation with continued savings is right. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Great. That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Good morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Good morning. Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Bigger picture capital allocation question for you. Stock's at 15 times EBITDA. The market clearly likes buybacks, but when do those buybacks become less attractive, especially as you think about other tuck-in acquisitions or investment opportunities within the portfolio that might have better returns? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Great question. We look at it all the time. Certainly, first and foremost, we want to be investing in our business in value accretive ways. And whether that is by a contract, by a loan, by a brand acquisition, no matter how we look at it, first and foremost, we want to grow our business. But the reality is we've got a model that generates far more than we need to invest in our business, and we continue to be, as you can tell, from our share repurchase to date, we continue to feel great about returning our shareholders in kind of the balance that we're doing across a combination of dividends and share repurchase. Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. So as a follow-up, are you not seeing those other opportunities, or buyback still make sense at 15 times earnings? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. No, no, no, we're seeing opportunities, but as I was describing, our model, the reality, the $500 million to $700 million that we've described and the need to basically continue to grow our business that's in the model and we continue to expect to spend that. And to the extent there are other things that come along, we absolutely take a look at them. Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Fair enough. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC Great. Thanks. I wanted to circle back on April. I think you noted it was running up 2%. I'm curious how much of a headwind Easter was to April, and heading into the quarter... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Vince, make sure you heard the data. Year-to-date, April was 2%. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC Got it. So I was curious, how much of a headwind you thought Easter would be to April? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Easter will be a headwind to April. And we don't have final numbers yet for April. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. But for... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. It will be a headwind for April and it will be a headwind for Q2. I would think that it's nearly 1 point positive to Q1 and nearly 1 point negative to Q2. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. That's right. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. And please take that as directional because we don't even have final April numbers yet. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC Helpful, thanks. And then also just thinking about demand and specifically related to the occupancy gains, I think 1Q showed some nice growth and I'm curious within your full year budget how much you're thinking occupancy will play into it and if you think occupancy will be positive in 2017. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Globally I would think it will be positive, but I think in North America, much more likely to have RevPAR driven by rate as opposed to occupancy I think as the year goes along. Hotels are practically already quite full, and of course, it will depend a little bit quarter by quarter based on the holidays, but the contribution should be more rate-driven. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC Great. Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Telsey Group. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Thank you for allowing me back in. I just wanted to ask... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Are you back for more? David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC I'm back for more, first and last. It was some psychological theory I learned a million years ago... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. There you ago. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC ...primacy and recency. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. There you go. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC But, as we go through the model and we update all of the portfolio of brands, are there any updated thoughts about the range of brands? And, quite frankly, it seems like a lot, a long laundry list of brands, and how sustainable that can be over the very long term? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. No. We are thrilled by the number of brands we have and the range of choice that we can give to our customers, as we've spent obviously time talking about this at the Analyst Conference. There's no different thinking today than we laid out then. And we can all look at our 30 brands and our 1.2 million hotel rooms and say that's a lot, but it's nothing compared to the range of choice that's offered by the third-party intermediaries. And offering more choice to our customers is a great thing. And as a consequence, you should presume that we will continue with these brands and that our effort will not be about getting to fewer brands, but instead getting to emphasize the distinctions between brands and make sure we are driving the compliance, if you will, or the consistency of product quality and service quality so that the customers are experiencing something which is consistent with what each of those brands stand for. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Appreciate it. Thank you for letting me back in. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. You bet. Operator Our final question in queue today is a follow-up from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Hey, Joe. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Joe? Operator Joe, if you're on mute... Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC Can you hear me, guys? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Now we can. There you go. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Yeah. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC All right. Obviously intuitively for the third quarter in a row, merger related costs decreased on a sequential basis. How much anticipated merger-related costs do you have for the balance of this year? And would you expect that to continue to go down on a sequential basis? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. I think the best I could say, Joe, right now is that we have to look at this as we keep moving along and getting through integration. So we don't have a final number for you. I think over $100 million in 2017 is the right expectation. Obviously we've already had $51 million in Q1, so that would kind of argue that we'll continue to move through the year, but exactly where we end up, whether it's $100 million or a bit more, it's too soon to say. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC And the $100 million that you're talking about would be on a pre-tax not post-tax basis? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc. Yes. That's a pre-tax basis, right. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great. Thanks. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc. Okay. Well, thank you all very much for your participation and your interest in the Marriott story. We'd love to welcome you into our hotels as you travel around the world. Talk to you soon.
