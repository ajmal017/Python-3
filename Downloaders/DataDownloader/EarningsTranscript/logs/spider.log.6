Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call. I will now turn the call over to François. François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. Thank you, Jason. I'd like to begin by echoing my welcome to everyone on this call. Thank you for joining us today. I'm thrilled to be taking the helm of F5, a company that represents such a strong platform for growth and innovation. My confidence in F5 has only been bolstered by the time I have spent with our teams, our customers and our partners this past month. Part of the major appeal of joining F5, in the first place, was its broad array of industry-leading products that customers love and its long record of successful execution in both sales and service. But I can say that my early insight into F5's position is also defined by the technical depth of talent and world-class operations and systems that I see here. I have the luxury of a fresh perspective to see just how deep the passion and loyalty run at F5. And I say that coming from Ciena, where the team's focus rivals F5 in terms of innovation and customer service. Beyond the company's core assets and its people, F5's core expertise in application services is a critical differentiator. With the speed at which this digital economy runs, the number of business-critical applications and the services they need will only increase. This insatiable demand for more applications and more application services bodes very well for F5. Because we stand in front of more applications than any other company in the industry, we understand better than anyone how to make those applications perform and how to secure them. In the near term, I intend to build on the foundation laid during John McAdam's tenure as CEO, and my immediate priority is maintaining our focus on the plans outlined in last November's Analyst and Investor Meeting. Those execution priorities are closely aligned with my own view of trends in customer demands and the opportunities ahead. Specifically, we will continue to expand the breadth of application services, including security, that we offer our customers. And we will accelerate our efforts to make our solutions easily deployable in the combinations our customers choose: in the public cloud, private cloud, co-location facilities and our own cloud-based platform, Silverline, as well as in the data center. I want to conclude by thanking the global F5 team, partners and customers for their incredibly warm welcome in my first month on board. And in the months to come, I look forward to connecting with F5's wider analyst and investor community, as well as reacquainting myself with those of you with whom I have worked in the past. I'd now like to turn the call over to Andy for a review of our second quarter. Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Thank you, François. With François new to F5, my prepared remarks for Q2 are a bit expanded and will flow as follows. I will open with high-level comments on the quarterly results, next share a number of Q2 customer wins, followed by an update on products for Q2. Then, I will give more detail on revenue and other selected financial results, as is normal, and conclude with commentary on new products and functionality being introduced in Q3, combined with our Q3 outlook. F5 delivered revenue of $518.2 million in fiscal Q2, reflecting year-over-year revenue growth of 7%. The majority of this growth came from sales strength in the U.S., highlighted by strong enterprise and service provider sales, offset by continued weakness in EMEA and lower-than-expected services revenue. We were particularly pleased to see product revenue growth accelerate to 7% year-over-year in Q2, up from 2% year-over-year growth in the prior quarter. GAAP EPS was $1.43 per share for the quarter, while non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.95. During Q2, we had a number of large wins that helped drive product revenue growth and reflect our continuing focus on opportunities in security and the cloud. To cope with the explosive growth of traffic resulting from its unlimited data plans, a large U.S. service provider is deploying VIPRION Gi firewalls across mobile switching centers, which will support over 100 million subscribers nationwide. VIPRION's superior scalability and high-performance enable the customer to replace its existing firewalls on a smaller footprint at significantly lower cost. As part of its Cloud Edge strategy, a top U.S. financial institution needed to provide secure access to third-party affiliates such as mortgage companies and credit card processors. Their decision to deploy VIPRION in an Equinix based co-location facility provided an extensible platform that can be used to lock their third-party affiliates to specific applications. The VIPRION solution also enables millisecond response times as they build and access applications in the cloud. In EMEA, a large government agency launched a project that includes plans to go digital in every court and tribunal. This involves initially moving three key services and later expanding to 20 to the Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform. The agency has license virtual additions of LTM, AFM and ASM, allowing it to operating applications seamlessly between on-prem and the cloud ensuring the same level of security. Closer to home, a large beverage retailer and a Silverline DDoS customer expanded its Silverline services with the new three-year contract that includes Silverline's WAF protection as well. Under the new contract, both the DDoS and WAF services will also be extended to the company's workloads in Azure. These another major wins during the quarter, as well as significant opportunities in the pipeline continue to validate F5's ability to deliver products that meet the increasingly varied and complex needs of our customers, as they migrate towards hybrid infrastructures. Contributing to stronger product revenue growth, the entire family of new iSeries appliances was available for the entire quarter. Customer response has been positive, and we continue to be happy with the uptick of the new platforms which was in line with prior appliance refresh cycles. We launched TMOS 13.0 during Q2, which includes a number of important new features. Among them, enhancements to enterprise and service provider protocols, including DNS, HTTP, and TCP and the addition of MQTT support, which is specific for IoT workloads. We also introduced new security features and functions, including OAuth 2.0 identity support and improvements to Behavioral DDoS, bot detection and fingerprinting. Also included with the launch of the TMOS 13.0 is the new, high-performance 40-gig version of our Virtual Edition. In addition, we continue to see steady demand for a 100-gig VIPRION blade, which now includes availability of our vCMP functionality. Other new security products introduced during the quarter include our new Herculon product family, which allows our sales force to sell DDoS Hybrid Defender and SSL Orchestrator in a stand-alone form factor or as solutions on BIG-IP. And, finally, we made our WAF solution available as a utility offering in the Microsoft Azure marketplace. Switching gears to detailed results for the quarter. Product revenue of $241.1 million grew 7% year-over-year and represented 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $277.2 million also grew 7% year-over-year and accounted for 53% of total revenue. Revenue from the Americas accounted for 56% of total revenue during the quarter, up 7% from the second quarter of 2016. EMEA contributed 24% of revenue, up 4% year-over-year. While APAC contributed 15% of revenue, reflecting year-over-year growth of 16%. And Japan, at 5%, was down slightly year-over-year. Enterprise customers represented 65% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 22%. And government sales were 13%, including 4% of total sales from U.S. Federal. In Q2, we had four greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted 17.9% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which represented 16.3% of total revenue; Tech Data, formerly Avnet, representing 12.6%; and Arrow, contributing 10.5%. Our GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 83%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6%. GAAP operating expenses were $291.8 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $252.8 million. GAAP operating margin was 26.7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.8%. And our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 33.4%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32%. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $175.3 million. In Q2, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $138.16 for a total of $150 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments. DSO at the end of Q2 was 51 days. Inventories were $32.5 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9.6 million. Deferred revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $929.6 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,515 employees, an increase of 55 from the prior quarter. Moving on to new products and outlook for Q3. In Q3, we will introduce new products and functionality that further extend our opportunities across on-prem, public cloud and private cloud architectures. First, we will introduce our support for BIG-IP in the Google public cloud. We will also be releasing App Connector 1.0, which enables our customers to connect the public and private cloud application infrastructures, effectively extending their private cloud workloads into the public cloud. In addition, we will launch a set of technologies that enable microservice environments, including our Container Connector, which orchestrates BIG-IPs with microservice environments; and a new Application Services Proxy, which links components within microservice environments. And we will release the next version of BIG-IQ, which further increases it's scalability and will provide our customers with enhanced visibility and analytics. As we look to the back half of the year, we continue to foresee momentum from the business drivers we outlined at the beginning of the year. The continued adoption of our iSeries products, accelerating sales of software solutions and F5's growing relevance in cloud environments, all serve as a foundation for continued product revenue growth. While, we are pleased with the uptick the products introduced in the first half of the year and excited about the opportunities the continuing influx of new products represent, we feel that the ongoing uncertainty in EMEA merits prudence as we approach our outlook for Q3. With this in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 is $520 million to $530 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 83% range, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84.5%. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $286 million to $296 million. This includes approximately $38.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. For Q3, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 34% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 32%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.47 to $1.50 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $2.01 to $2.04 per share. We plan to increase our head count by up to 60 employees in the current quarter. And we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $170 million. We would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you, speakers. Participants, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Speakers, our first question will come from the line Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks. And François and Jason, good luck to you on your new roles. Andy, I guess, you're going to be the speaker for tonight. Maybe we can dive a little bit into what's going on in Europe and on the weakness that you're seeing there. First of all, is there a way for you to kind of quantify to us how much you missed over there? I'm just trying to gauge, if your report have been fine, where do you think you would have landed relative to your original guide? And then, is there any color you can give about that weakness, whether it be enterprise, service provider, ADC, security, North Europe, South Europe, UK, FX-driven, competitive-driven, anything that you can give would be greatly appreciated? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah, yeah. So two things I'd highlight there related to guide. I'd be reluctant to quantify, but EMEA combined with the shortfall that we saw on services, which  we had talked last quarter about services continuing to decline, but then through the year we'd see it shallow out and then start to grow again. It ended up dropping a little more than we anticipated, and that was us just misreading the tea leaves on some end-of-life products, so to get that out there. Coming back to EMEA, the combination of those two, yeah, they would've had impact on the number we think. So that's why we're highlighting it, and it has our focus. And then, in terms of what we're seeing there, John, did you want to? John D. DiLullo - F5 Networks, Inc. Well, this is John DiLullo, so we have a very experienced team there. And I think they're doing well, but we're definitely seeing a few delays in a couple of areas. I think some of that is connected to some macro conditions. People are trying to understand exactly what it means, what Brexit means, from a data residency perspective and then, also, some of the new data protection regulations that are coming out. And I think that's pausing things for us and that's what's causing a bit of the delay there in order flow. And we have a couple of execution problems too that we're working through. We've put some new leadership in the UK and in Germany. And we're doing a lot more to map the teams to some of the public cloud growth opportunities out there, and also doing a lot more training. But I think we're making progress. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Okay. Andy, just a follow-up on that. On your outlook, you've mentioned it conservative just given the issues that you're seeing. Can you give us a little bit more color about your working assumptions into Europe specifically for the next quarter, or are you assuming no improvement whatsoever in the region? How do we think about your level of conservatism with regards to that region? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. I'm not sure conservatism is the word I'd use on this, because I think we've been talking with the sales organization, evaluating the pipeline, looking at the business. We've highlighted this for a number of quarters now. This really isn't a new dynamic for us. And I think taking it all in collectively, we looked at the picture that we thought we could expect from the business at this time and factored that into the guidance. And that's resulted in the guidance we gave you today. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Very good. Good luck, guys. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And, François, welcome to the team. Couple questions. Maybe just first, can you talk about linearity in the quarter, average deal sizes and the percentage of revenue from new appliances? And then, in past product cycles we've typically seen a fairly healthy acceleration in product growth in the quarters following the big initial launch. So I was hoping to understand if you think we'll see a similar trajectory in the second half of this year. Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah, Jess. And you might have to help me if I miss one of your questions, but I think you started with linearity. And actually, early in the quarter, we felt pretty good about our start in January. As we got through the first month, we felt pretty good about it and then started to see it taper off. It was similar to the prior quarter, in that middle month kind of pull back and then landed okay, I would put it. And then, to your question on our product refresh. One thing we talk about a lot is the uptake in the product refresh, and I think at times we don't draw the conclusion we want you to draw when we make these comments, because we talk about  in the first full quarter, we want to see roughly 25% and we see that increasing over four quarters to 80%. And so, when does that really kick in for us is a driver? And if we look back historically, really it's when we start to get into the higher percentages of the sales being represented by those new appliances that we really see the full driver. So we did feel we saw some good wins this quarter and it did impact the product revenue growth that we saw. But we think we're going to see that get through Q3 and start to build after that. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC And then, average deal size, and I guess would love it if you could touch on just kind of how the public cloud is playing into the results you're seeing and what gives you confidence the public cloud can be an opportunity and isn't the cause of some of the weakness you're seeing here? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. So on the average deal size; I think last quarter we were at right around $110,000. This quarter it moved up a little bit, $125,000. So one of the things that is giving us confidence is seeing the average deal size move up a little bit. But our $1 million plus size deals were actually pretty strong across the rest of the world. And when we evaluate our business, that's an important metric for that. And then, for cloud. John D. DiLullo - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. On the public cloud, Jess. I think what we're seeing is that customers are at varying stages of their cloud adoption strategy, where when customers haven't made their decision on public cloud migrations or really their architectural decisions, and they're a little bit hesitant. That's not as good for us. When they have made their decisions and they are actually embarking on a cloud strategy, then we're seeing multiple catalysts for us. In fact, we've done some analysis around that. And we're seeing that those customers who have moved to the public cloud that were F5 customers before actually tend to spend more with us once they've made those moves. So that's kind of a catalyst for us. Silverline is a catalyst for us as our own proposition in the cloud. So we're seeing sort of multiple catalysts emerge. But really, for us, it's really good when customers have made their architectural decision and they actually have moved to the cloud. That's when things accelerate for us. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks, guys. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Jeffrey Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura | Instinet Thank you very much. François, let me add my voice to those congratulating you on the seat. I know that the people on Ciena certainly miss you. And, Jason, I am looking forward to working with you as well. Let me begin, maybe Andy, by digging into your commentary on the product refresh being in line with the prior one. The prior one was a little bit more diffused in terms of its timeliness, this is a little tighter. And yet the product revenue was still able to get up to about 20% growth year-over-year for a few quarters. Is that the kind of in-line that you were referencing, or if you could put some more color around that I'd appreciate it? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. Specifically, my in-line was the uptick of the appliances in sales. So not necessarily the  I don't know that I can verify your 20%. I mean it definitely did, when it got to full steam, drive very solid revenue growth. And so, when we look at it internally, we look at the uptick and start to watch when it gets  we're in the second quarter, it's in line in terms of percent with what we've seen previously. Your comment's very fair, it was more elongated before. So we're trying to factor that in and then looking at how it's going to drive product. And as I said, we have our guidance and we think we'll see that really start to kick in as we exit Q3. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura | Instinet Okay. So would it be fair to say then it will be the June and September quarters where you should see the peak year-over-year of comparables, and that should be materially higher than where we are today? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. Well, you have our guidance for June, right? So I'm going to let that stand as it is. Then, I think as we go into Q4, which is our calendar Q4, has its own dynamics. And I think we'll see it play in there. And then really as we expand out 18 months to 24 months and if you look historically, that's when we've seen it be a real strong driver. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura | Instinet Okay. And then, lastly, the gross margin. Obviously, very good. Again, are you seeing any reasons why that would drift up given the rising mix of software? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. We always talk about that as software becomes more prominent in our business, that naturally is going to carry up to gross margin. Historically, we've looked look at that as an opportunity to derive top line growth. Probably the most prominent example recently is investments in Silverline. And I think we'll continue to do that and balance that trade-off of investment against higher gross margin. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura | Instinet Thank you very much. Talk soon. Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Thanks. Okay. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Jayson Noland of Baird. Your line is open. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay, great. Thank you. François, I wanted to start with you and ask your initial thoughts. I know you haven't been in the seat long. But maybe if you could add some color and then any adjustments you see necessary to make here regarding areas of focus? I heard you mentioned security in your prepared remarks. François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. Yes. Thank you, Jayson. Well, sort of early observations. As I said it in my prepared remarks, really, really excited to be here. And I thought before joining and even more now that F5 has a very significant opportunity and has a big platform for growth, largely because of this insatiable demand for applications. And that sort of application networking talent here and understanding around what it takes to make applications perform better, go faster, be more secure, that talent and that understanding is unparalleled. And so, really for us the focus and the things that I want to make sure we execute on is, making sure we remain in the critical path of applications wherever they are, private cloud, public cloud, data centers. And the company has already started executing on that. But there's a ton of things that we can do to even expand the number of applications that we support. As an example of that, just yesterday we were meeting with one of our large Fortune 500 customers. They have over 4,000 applications, and we're only sitting and supporting a fraction of those applications. And as they move to both their private cloud and some public cloud implementation, we've got an opportunity to expand the number of applications that we support for that customer. And so, I'm really excited about that opportunity. And then, the other access of potential growth for us is expanding the number of application services that we offer. Security is one of them. And we've already made a lot of headway in adding security capabilities to the ADC, but there are other things that we can do. And so, I see those two areas are important vectors for the company. And the priority right now is to make sure that we execute on these vectors. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay, thank you. And maybe a follow-up for Andy. You've mentioned $400 million run rate in software as an expectation exiting 2017, is there upside or downside to that or are right on track? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. I think we're right on track. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you very much. Given that the moving parts here  and, by the way, François and Jason, both welcome as well. Let me extend that to you two. I imagine you'll hear this over and over again. But wanted to see if you could talk about the past historical seasonal patterns for the company, in that you've previously indicated operating margin in the second half of the year tend to move back towards the high-30% range versus sort of mid-30s in the first half of the year. Wondering if you're comfortable reiterating that perspective at this point, even if you're not guiding for the balance of the year on revenue? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. I think specifically what we say, and this on the October call, is we gave general guidelines of guidance. And we have said pretty consistently over the last three or four years that we expect op margin with seasonality to pull back in Q1 and Q2, because it's important for us to not slow the machine down on our investing and head count to try to overly  I'll use the term overly manage op margin. And then, on strength of revenue see that increase in the back half. So I believe that plays out on revenue strength again. And you have our guidance, as I said, for Q3. And then, we'll give guidance for Q4 and see where that takes us. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. And then, in terms of a product trends, I'm looking for some indication of how to think about the Herculon family. I know it's new and you're just coming come into market. But what kind of expectations do you have in terms of contributions. And I think part of the thing I'm struggling with is, with security you're entering a market that's relatively mature with lots of competitors. And, historically, it's been difficult I think for F5 to sort of break out from the ADC market. And you certainly have had security features within your platforms, but now you have the security appliance. I'd like to see if you can help us level set, basically get a good expectation of how much contribution we should expect from specifically Herculon products maybe one year out? How should we think about that as a contribution? Thank you. François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. Thank you, Simon. It's François here. So you're correct, in that we have made some enhancements to the ADC platform that include a number of security offerings. If you look at our overall revenue growth, we had actually very strong growth, let's say, north of double-digit year-on-year growth in the security space overall in our portfolio in the second quarter. And that's primarily driven by security add-ons that we've put on top of the ADC platform. The Herculon product is just out in the market now. It's really early days. So we don't expect it to have really meaningful contribution for several quarters. And you're right, it is effectively our first family of purpose-built platform for security. And so, there's an element of learning in the market that we're going through over the next few quarters. But we also believe that it addresses an important pain point and a growing pain point for a number of our customers. So longer term, we actually think we have a very compelling proposition, and that there's going to be strong demand for the platform. It's really early days for us to quantify the contribution it will make to the business overall. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you. Good luck with it. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you very much. You mentioned some challenges in Europe, ranging all the way from Brexit to regulations and all the type of things. Can you help us understand, is there going to be the need to change your go-to-market strategy, your sales force, realign things? Do you feel you got the right efforts in place? And is the majority of the shortfall in Europe under your control, or are you saying it's more regulatory Brexit uncertainty that's going on there? Thank you. John D. DiLullo - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. Jim, it's John DiLullo. So I think it's definitely under control and some of these macro issues feel more like pauses rather than systemic issues. The team that we have there is a very experienced team that was setting records just four, five quarters ago. So we think it's a temporary collection of macro elements that we need to work through. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. And then, the resolution time you think will be, when? François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. So this is François here. Well, on the macro issues, yeah, I think it's several months because, as you know, these macro issues, there's both issues around data residency and sort of regulation that's being passed in Europe. There has also been macro issues around the political environment. And as you know, we're going through, specifically in Continental Europe, a number of elections. And a number of large projects, frankly, have been delayed because the uncertainty surrounding these elections is probably greater than it's ever been in Continental Europe. So that I think kind of works itself through as we get the results of these elections and the political uncertainty goes away. In terms of the things that we control which are more around the sort of realignment of our resources with the right opportunities, as John was saying, we have some things in motion already. But you probably know this and I know this with experience having spent a lot of time in Europe that these issues take a long time to fix, because they're not  moving resources in Europe isn't as simple and straightforward as it might be here in the United States. Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. And this is Andy. Just one thing to add that we're not seeing  and I think it's important to highlight and was within John's comments was, the competitive landscape there for us hasn't changed. And obviously with the comments we're putting out here just around the theater, I mean we spend a lot of time talking with sales management making sure we understand what's going on. And the one area that we came away feeling good about is, competitively we feel as strong as ever. And that's why John was highlighting that we saw deals pushing, not deals losing. And we think that's important to highlight. So we are readdressing everything from the structure, and how we're aligning resources and the view of the market coming through in our guidance, but I think that's worth highlighting on a positive note. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you so much for the details. Operator Our next question will come from the line Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is open. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc. Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Just trying to get a sense here if we can kind of try to figure out what the extrapolation is with the guidance. And it kind of implies pretty much single-digit product revenue growth already so soon here with this product cycle. Does that mean we're going to actually potentially see you guys decline next year from a product revenue perspective or are we missing something? And then, I just wanted to see if you could talk a little more about market share momentum and your confidence just given that Amazon, AWS, keeps taking share in pretty short order here. If that continues, how can you still grow longer term? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. Yeah. So I'll take the first part of that question, which is our view on growth and product. And, yes, if you back into our guidance with what we give you, that might look like it's pulling back a little bit. But, broadly, we think we're going to be pushing hard on the top line and we think we have every opportunity with the drivers we have in place. We're talking about the Shuttle series and a lot of the other products. Our viewpoint is not that. I wouldn't comment on next year, up or down, but we believe we're a growth company. At our scale, what does that mean? We'll see. We provide guidance quarterly, but that's our number one priority to push the top line, and we're going to focus on execution and work to make that happen. François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. And, Mark, as it relates to AWS, we're confident we can continue to grow over time and actually maintain or grow share. If you look at the dynamics in the marketplace, the overall ADC market is growing, the hardware ADC market is probably flat to down, whilst the virtual ADC market is growing fairly rapidly. Within the growth of the virtual ADC market, there are use cases that potentially are best addressed by a simple implementation with the AWS solution. So if a small enterprise has a single use case that doesn't require a lot of application services, but just simple load balancing, then that's a scenario where there's a good fit for a WAF-type solution. But there are a large number of use cases in the virtual ADC space that are well addressed by our Virtual Edition, and we're seeing actually very significant revenue growth on our Virtual Edition and generally in software as a percentage of our revenues in general. So we're pretty confident that with what we've done and a number of the things we talked about today in terms of our road map, that we're going to continue to see growth in our Virtual Edition, included in a number of use cases in the public and private cloud. So we're pretty confident that we address a large number of use cases, and we can continue to grow. Jason Willey - F5 Networks, Inc. Take the next question, please. Operator Our next question will come from the line of George Notter of Jefferies. Your line is open. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC Hey, guys. Thanks very much. I guess, I wanted to ask a question to François. Obviously, you're new to the company, you're taking a fresh look at the business. I guess, I'm wondering if there is any thoughts of looking at the capital allocation strategy of the company, any new views on M&A, anything you could talk to on that front would be great? Thanks. François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. Thanks, George. And, hi. So let me start with capital allocation. Look, I think, I will start by saying that we see a great opportunity for F5 as a platform for growth and, therefore, we're going to manage the business for long-term growth. And as we do that, that may or may not require a change in how we allocate capital going forward. At this stage, it's too early to say whether that may or may not be the case. But for the short-term, there isn't going to be a change in our capital allocation model, that  I can say that definitively. When it comes to M&A, George, as you know, I come from experience with an organization that has been quite acquisitive over the years. And from my experience, M&A actually can be very effective for growth in the technology space. And a number of these opportunities can help a company a lot, but they can also go very wrong under the right circumstances. So, for me, it is going to be all about discipline in the case of M&A, really being disciplined about our build versus buy choices, really understanding why in some cases certain assets may be more valuable inside of F5 than outside of F5, and making sure that we have the right expertise in the company both to assess these opportunities and to make them successful if and when we pull the trigger on some acquisitions. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC Thank you. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Alex Henderson of Needham. Your line is open. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC Sneaking under the wire. So I was hoping we could get an angle on your expectation for Verizon's optical transport business in the core optical market for metro? François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. No comment, Alex. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC Okay. So since we can't do that, and as an alternative, I was hoping you could give us a little bit more granularity on what your revenue expectations are for the growth rate in software-only and the growth rate in public cloud-only, as well as in security-only? And if software is increasing as a percentage of sales, should we be expecting that to have a positive implication for the longer term gross margins, because I assume that that's a higher-margin product? Thanks. Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. I think, generally, we look at the broader trends that we're seeing across software security. François highlighted that our security had strong growth year-over-year, continue to expect that from software. We're not going to guide it specifically, but the trends are there and we like what we're seeing. And as it relates to gross margin, we talked about it a little bit earlier. Yeah, it could push up gross margin. We're not guiding that. We talk a lot about reinvesting that back in the business, and we'll continue to evaluate that on a quarterly basis as we see the opportunity present itself to us. But, broadly, the trends are there going in the right direction, and we like where we sit. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC Could you give us any more color on the rates of growth as opposed to, yes, it's nice. I mean, that's a pretty anemic way of describing the numbers relative to what you could provide? François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. Well, Alex, I think we can say that the three areas that you've mentioned, security, software/virtual additions and public cloud, are all growing faster than our overall revenues. In this case of security, I did mention earlier that we saw very strong double-digit growth in the quarter. In the case of the public cloud, I think we've said before, it is actually growing even faster than security, but from a very small base to start with. But I actually have some color for you, Alex, having been here just a few weeks. One of the areas of surprise for me was  a pleasant surprise  was to see how much we, as a company, are already doing in the public cloud on the various models, perpetual licenses, subscription, also the number of customers buying our Virtual Edition by the drink (47:44) as a utility, by the hour. And the number of hours we're billing in the public cloud is growing extremely rapidly. So these are all areas of growth with  right now, some more meaningful than others. I'd say, probably of these three overall software, as you know, as a percentage of our business is pretty large. So that's a meaningful contribution. Public cloud isn't yet a meaningful contribution. And security is growing and kind of in between those two. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Jason Willey - F5 Networks, Inc. Robert, I think we'll take one more question. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you very much. And, Francois, my congratulations to you as well. Andy, I was hoping you can expand on the weakness you saw in services. I was a little surprised to see it flat sequentially and, looking back, you guys have never had a flat sequential quarter in services before. And when we chatted at a conference in mid-February, I think you were still seeing at that point consistent attach rates and renewals. So maybe just give us a little more detail on what happened with the end-of-life products that you were referencing there and how we should think about that going forward? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. And actually the way to look at this is, we're modeling it is, sequentially it was basically flat, up $0.5 million. We think off of this new base we start to go to more normal growth rates again. And really the driver to that is, we did end of life a number of older boxes. I think they averaged over 7 years old and they did have strong attach rates to them, still renewal rates. The impact of it, frankly, I just  I missed the modeling on it and the impact was bigger than I anticipated. So that's where we ended up. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. So maybe just to be clear on that because I think you've said before that you've got something like 40,000 units in the installed base that are over 5 years. So of these over 7-year-old end-of-life products, are there any additional ones that might stop maintenance in the coming quarters? And has that now been factored into the expectation that this is the bottom? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. I don't think we're going to see anything in the short-term, and we'd advise you of that. I would highlight surrounding this discussion that our deferred revenue was pretty strong in the quarter. So we saw that go up 10%, and the majority of that is annual maintenance. So I would look at that too to balance the expectations. But as I said, when we started, we now think, off of this new base, it's a bit of reset, but we're going to start sequentially growing again at least in rough dollar basis consistent with what you've seen in the past. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just a quick one. I might have missed it. But did you say what percent software was as a percent of total revenue this quarter? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. No. We didn't break that out. No. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. Thanks, Simona. Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yes. Thank you. Jason Willey - F5 Networks, Inc. All right. Thank you. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you again in three months. Have a good rest of your day. François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

Participants, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Speakers, our first question will come from the line Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks. And François and Jason, good luck to you on your new roles. Andy, I guess, you're going to be the speaker for tonight. Maybe we can dive a little bit into what's going on in Europe and on the weakness that you're seeing there. First of all, is there a way for you to kind of quantify to us how much you missed over there? I'm just trying to gauge, if your report have been fine, where do you think you would have landed relative to your original guide? And then, is there any color you can give about that weakness, whether it be enterprise, service provider, ADC, security, North Europe, South Europe, UK, FX-driven, competitive-driven, anything that you can give would be greatly appreciated? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah, yeah. So two things I'd highlight there related to guide. I'd be reluctant to quantify, but EMEA combined with the shortfall that we saw on services, which  we had talked last quarter about services continuing to decline, but then through the year we'd see it shallow out and then start to grow again. It ended up dropping a little more than we anticipated, and that was us just misreading the tea leaves on some end-of-life products, so to get that out there. Coming back to EMEA, the combination of those two, yeah, they would've had impact on the number we think. So that's why we're highlighting it, and it has our focus. And then, in terms of what we're seeing there, John, did you want to? John D. DiLullo - F5 Networks, Inc. Well, this is John DiLullo, so we have a very experienced team there. And I think they're doing well, but we're definitely seeing a few delays in a couple of areas. I think some of that is connected to some macro conditions. People are trying to understand exactly what it means, what Brexit means, from a data residency perspective and then, also, some of the new data protection regulations that are coming out. And I think that's pausing things for us and that's what's causing a bit of the delay there in order flow. And we have a couple of execution problems too that we're working through. We've put some new leadership in the UK and in Germany. And we're doing a lot more to map the teams to some of the public cloud growth opportunities out there, and also doing a lot more training. But I think we're making progress. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Okay. Andy, just a follow-up on that. On your outlook, you've mentioned it conservative just given the issues that you're seeing. Can you give us a little bit more color about your working assumptions into Europe specifically for the next quarter, or are you assuming no improvement whatsoever in the region? How do we think about your level of conservatism with regards to that region? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. I'm not sure conservatism is the word I'd use on this, because I think we've been talking with the sales organization, evaluating the pipeline, looking at the business. We've highlighted this for a number of quarters now. This really isn't a new dynamic for us. And I think taking it all in collectively, we looked at the picture that we thought we could expect from the business at this time and factored that into the guidance. And that's resulted in the guidance we gave you today. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Very good. Good luck, guys. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And, François, welcome to the team. Couple questions. Maybe just first, can you talk about linearity in the quarter, average deal sizes and the percentage of revenue from new appliances? And then, in past product cycles we've typically seen a fairly healthy acceleration in product growth in the quarters following the big initial launch. So I was hoping to understand if you think we'll see a similar trajectory in the second half of this year. Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah, Jess. And you might have to help me if I miss one of your questions, but I think you started with linearity. And actually, early in the quarter, we felt pretty good about our start in January. As we got through the first month, we felt pretty good about it and then started to see it taper off. It was similar to the prior quarter, in that middle month kind of pull back and then landed okay, I would put it. And then, to your question on our product refresh. One thing we talk about a lot is the uptake in the product refresh, and I think at times we don't draw the conclusion we want you to draw when we make these comments, because we talk about  in the first full quarter, we want to see roughly 25% and we see that increasing over four quarters to 80%. And so, when does that really kick in for us is a driver? And if we look back historically, really it's when we start to get into the higher percentages of the sales being represented by those new appliances that we really see the full driver. So we did feel we saw some good wins this quarter and it did impact the product revenue growth that we saw. But we think we're going to see that get through Q3 and start to build after that. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC And then, average deal size, and I guess would love it if you could touch on just kind of how the public cloud is playing into the results you're seeing and what gives you confidence the public cloud can be an opportunity and isn't the cause of some of the weakness you're seeing here? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. So on the average deal size; I think last quarter we were at right around $110,000. This quarter it moved up a little bit, $125,000. So one of the things that is giving us confidence is seeing the average deal size move up a little bit. But our $1 million plus size deals were actually pretty strong across the rest of the world. And when we evaluate our business, that's an important metric for that. And then, for cloud. John D. DiLullo - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. On the public cloud, Jess. I think what we're seeing is that customers are at varying stages of their cloud adoption strategy, where when customers haven't made their decision on public cloud migrations or really their architectural decisions, and they're a little bit hesitant. That's not as good for us. When they have made their decisions and they are actually embarking on a cloud strategy, then we're seeing multiple catalysts for us. In fact, we've done some analysis around that. And we're seeing that those customers who have moved to the public cloud that were F5 customers before actually tend to spend more with us once they've made those moves. So that's kind of a catalyst for us. Silverline is a catalyst for us as our own proposition in the cloud. So we're seeing sort of multiple catalysts emerge. But really, for us, it's really good when customers have made their architectural decision and they actually have moved to the cloud. That's when things accelerate for us. Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks, guys. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Jeffrey Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura | Instinet Thank you very much. François, let me add my voice to those congratulating you on the seat. I know that the people on Ciena certainly miss you. And, Jason, I am looking forward to working with you as well. Let me begin, maybe Andy, by digging into your commentary on the product refresh being in line with the prior one. The prior one was a little bit more diffused in terms of its timeliness, this is a little tighter. And yet the product revenue was still able to get up to about 20% growth year-over-year for a few quarters. Is that the kind of in-line that you were referencing, or if you could put some more color around that I'd appreciate it? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. Specifically, my in-line was the uptick of the appliances in sales. So not necessarily the  I don't know that I can verify your 20%. I mean it definitely did, when it got to full steam, drive very solid revenue growth. And so, when we look at it internally, we look at the uptick and start to watch when it gets  we're in the second quarter, it's in line in terms of percent with what we've seen previously. Your comment's very fair, it was more elongated before. So we're trying to factor that in and then looking at how it's going to drive product. And as I said, we have our guidance and we think we'll see that really start to kick in as we exit Q3. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura | Instinet Okay. So would it be fair to say then it will be the June and September quarters where you should see the peak year-over-year of comparables, and that should be materially higher than where we are today? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. Well, you have our guidance for June, right? So I'm going to let that stand as it is. Then, I think as we go into Q4, which is our calendar Q4, has its own dynamics. And I think we'll see it play in there. And then really as we expand out 18 months to 24 months and if you look historically, that's when we've seen it be a real strong driver. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura | Instinet Okay. And then, lastly, the gross margin. Obviously, very good. Again, are you seeing any reasons why that would drift up given the rising mix of software? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. We always talk about that as software becomes more prominent in our business, that naturally is going to carry up to gross margin. Historically, we've looked look at that as an opportunity to derive top line growth. Probably the most prominent example recently is investments in Silverline. And I think we'll continue to do that and balance that trade-off of investment against higher gross margin. Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura | Instinet Thank you very much. Talk soon. Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Thanks. Okay. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Jayson Noland of Baird. Your line is open. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay, great. Thank you. François, I wanted to start with you and ask your initial thoughts. I know you haven't been in the seat long. But maybe if you could add some color and then any adjustments you see necessary to make here regarding areas of focus? I heard you mentioned security in your prepared remarks. François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. Yes. Thank you, Jayson. Well, sort of early observations. As I said it in my prepared remarks, really, really excited to be here. And I thought before joining and even more now that F5 has a very significant opportunity and has a big platform for growth, largely because of this insatiable demand for applications. And that sort of application networking talent here and understanding around what it takes to make applications perform better, go faster, be more secure, that talent and that understanding is unparalleled. And so, really for us the focus and the things that I want to make sure we execute on is, making sure we remain in the critical path of applications wherever they are, private cloud, public cloud, data centers. And the company has already started executing on that. But there's a ton of things that we can do to even expand the number of applications that we support. As an example of that, just yesterday we were meeting with one of our large Fortune 500 customers. They have over 4,000 applications, and we're only sitting and supporting a fraction of those applications. And as they move to both their private cloud and some public cloud implementation, we've got an opportunity to expand the number of applications that we support for that customer. And so, I'm really excited about that opportunity. And then, the other access of potential growth for us is expanding the number of application services that we offer. Security is one of them. And we've already made a lot of headway in adding security capabilities to the ADC, but there are other things that we can do. And so, I see those two areas are important vectors for the company. And the priority right now is to make sure that we execute on these vectors. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay, thank you. And maybe a follow-up for Andy. You've mentioned $400 million run rate in software as an expectation exiting 2017, is there upside or downside to that or are right on track? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. I think we're right on track. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you very much. Given that the moving parts here  and, by the way, François and Jason, both welcome as well. Let me extend that to you two. I imagine you'll hear this over and over again. But wanted to see if you could talk about the past historical seasonal patterns for the company, in that you've previously indicated operating margin in the second half of the year tend to move back towards the high-30% range versus sort of mid-30s in the first half of the year. Wondering if you're comfortable reiterating that perspective at this point, even if you're not guiding for the balance of the year on revenue? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. I think specifically what we say, and this on the October call, is we gave general guidelines of guidance. And we have said pretty consistently over the last three or four years that we expect op margin with seasonality to pull back in Q1 and Q2, because it's important for us to not slow the machine down on our investing and head count to try to overly  I'll use the term overly manage op margin. And then, on strength of revenue see that increase in the back half. So I believe that plays out on revenue strength again. And you have our guidance, as I said, for Q3. And then, we'll give guidance for Q4 and see where that takes us. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. And then, in terms of a product trends, I'm looking for some indication of how to think about the Herculon family. I know it's new and you're just coming come into market. But what kind of expectations do you have in terms of contributions. And I think part of the thing I'm struggling with is, with security you're entering a market that's relatively mature with lots of competitors. And, historically, it's been difficult I think for F5 to sort of break out from the ADC market. And you certainly have had security features within your platforms, but now you have the security appliance. I'd like to see if you can help us level set, basically get a good expectation of how much contribution we should expect from specifically Herculon products maybe one year out? How should we think about that as a contribution? Thank you. François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. Thank you, Simon. It's François here. So you're correct, in that we have made some enhancements to the ADC platform that include a number of security offerings. If you look at our overall revenue growth, we had actually very strong growth, let's say, north of double-digit year-on-year growth in the security space overall in our portfolio in the second quarter. And that's primarily driven by security add-ons that we've put on top of the ADC platform. The Herculon product is just out in the market now. It's really early days. So we don't expect it to have really meaningful contribution for several quarters. And you're right, it is effectively our first family of purpose-built platform for security. And so, there's an element of learning in the market that we're going through over the next few quarters. But we also believe that it addresses an important pain point and a growing pain point for a number of our customers. So longer term, we actually think we have a very compelling proposition, and that there's going to be strong demand for the platform. It's really early days for us to quantify the contribution it will make to the business overall. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you. Good luck with it. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you very much. You mentioned some challenges in Europe, ranging all the way from Brexit to regulations and all the type of things. Can you help us understand, is there going to be the need to change your go-to-market strategy, your sales force, realign things? Do you feel you got the right efforts in place? And is the majority of the shortfall in Europe under your control, or are you saying it's more regulatory Brexit uncertainty that's going on there? Thank you. John D. DiLullo - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. Jim, it's John DiLullo. So I think it's definitely under control and some of these macro issues feel more like pauses rather than systemic issues. The team that we have there is a very experienced team that was setting records just four, five quarters ago. So we think it's a temporary collection of macro elements that we need to work through. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. And then, the resolution time you think will be, when? François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. So this is François here. Well, on the macro issues, yeah, I think it's several months because, as you know, these macro issues, there's both issues around data residency and sort of regulation that's being passed in Europe. There has also been macro issues around the political environment. And as you know, we're going through, specifically in Continental Europe, a number of elections. And a number of large projects, frankly, have been delayed because the uncertainty surrounding these elections is probably greater than it's ever been in Continental Europe. So that I think kind of works itself through as we get the results of these elections and the political uncertainty goes away. In terms of the things that we control which are more around the sort of realignment of our resources with the right opportunities, as John was saying, we have some things in motion already. But you probably know this and I know this with experience having spent a lot of time in Europe that these issues take a long time to fix, because they're not  moving resources in Europe isn't as simple and straightforward as it might be here in the United States. Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. And this is Andy. Just one thing to add that we're not seeing  and I think it's important to highlight and was within John's comments was, the competitive landscape there for us hasn't changed. And obviously with the comments we're putting out here just around the theater, I mean we spend a lot of time talking with sales management making sure we understand what's going on. And the one area that we came away feeling good about is, competitively we feel as strong as ever. And that's why John was highlighting that we saw deals pushing, not deals losing. And we think that's important to highlight. So we are readdressing everything from the structure, and how we're aligning resources and the view of the market coming through in our guidance, but I think that's worth highlighting on a positive note. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you so much for the details. Operator Our next question will come from the line Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is open. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc. Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Just trying to get a sense here if we can kind of try to figure out what the extrapolation is with the guidance. And it kind of implies pretty much single-digit product revenue growth already so soon here with this product cycle. Does that mean we're going to actually potentially see you guys decline next year from a product revenue perspective or are we missing something? And then, I just wanted to see if you could talk a little more about market share momentum and your confidence just given that Amazon, AWS, keeps taking share in pretty short order here. If that continues, how can you still grow longer term? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. Yeah. So I'll take the first part of that question, which is our view on growth and product. And, yes, if you back into our guidance with what we give you, that might look like it's pulling back a little bit. But, broadly, we think we're going to be pushing hard on the top line and we think we have every opportunity with the drivers we have in place. We're talking about the Shuttle series and a lot of the other products. Our viewpoint is not that. I wouldn't comment on next year, up or down, but we believe we're a growth company. At our scale, what does that mean? We'll see. We provide guidance quarterly, but that's our number one priority to push the top line, and we're going to focus on execution and work to make that happen. François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. And, Mark, as it relates to AWS, we're confident we can continue to grow over time and actually maintain or grow share. If you look at the dynamics in the marketplace, the overall ADC market is growing, the hardware ADC market is probably flat to down, whilst the virtual ADC market is growing fairly rapidly. Within the growth of the virtual ADC market, there are use cases that potentially are best addressed by a simple implementation with the AWS solution. So if a small enterprise has a single use case that doesn't require a lot of application services, but just simple load balancing, then that's a scenario where there's a good fit for a WAF-type solution. But there are a large number of use cases in the virtual ADC space that are well addressed by our Virtual Edition, and we're seeing actually very significant revenue growth on our Virtual Edition and generally in software as a percentage of our revenues in general. So we're pretty confident that with what we've done and a number of the things we talked about today in terms of our road map, that we're going to continue to see growth in our Virtual Edition, included in a number of use cases in the public and private cloud. So we're pretty confident that we address a large number of use cases, and we can continue to grow. Jason Willey - F5 Networks, Inc. Take the next question, please. Operator Our next question will come from the line of George Notter of Jefferies. Your line is open. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC Hey, guys. Thanks very much. I guess, I wanted to ask a question to François. Obviously, you're new to the company, you're taking a fresh look at the business. I guess, I'm wondering if there is any thoughts of looking at the capital allocation strategy of the company, any new views on M&A, anything you could talk to on that front would be great? Thanks. François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. Thanks, George. And, hi. So let me start with capital allocation. Look, I think, I will start by saying that we see a great opportunity for F5 as a platform for growth and, therefore, we're going to manage the business for long-term growth. And as we do that, that may or may not require a change in how we allocate capital going forward. At this stage, it's too early to say whether that may or may not be the case. But for the short-term, there isn't going to be a change in our capital allocation model, that  I can say that definitively. When it comes to M&A, George, as you know, I come from experience with an organization that has been quite acquisitive over the years. And from my experience, M&A actually can be very effective for growth in the technology space. And a number of these opportunities can help a company a lot, but they can also go very wrong under the right circumstances. So, for me, it is going to be all about discipline in the case of M&A, really being disciplined about our build versus buy choices, really understanding why in some cases certain assets may be more valuable inside of F5 than outside of F5, and making sure that we have the right expertise in the company both to assess these opportunities and to make them successful if and when we pull the trigger on some acquisitions. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC Thank you. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Alex Henderson of Needham. Your line is open. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC Sneaking under the wire. So I was hoping we could get an angle on your expectation for Verizon's optical transport business in the core optical market for metro? François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. No comment, Alex. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC Okay. So since we can't do that, and as an alternative, I was hoping you could give us a little bit more granularity on what your revenue expectations are for the growth rate in software-only and the growth rate in public cloud-only, as well as in security-only? And if software is increasing as a percentage of sales, should we be expecting that to have a positive implication for the longer term gross margins, because I assume that that's a higher-margin product? Thanks. Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. I think, generally, we look at the broader trends that we're seeing across software security. François highlighted that our security had strong growth year-over-year, continue to expect that from software. We're not going to guide it specifically, but the trends are there and we like what we're seeing. And as it relates to gross margin, we talked about it a little bit earlier. Yeah, it could push up gross margin. We're not guiding that. We talk a lot about reinvesting that back in the business, and we'll continue to evaluate that on a quarterly basis as we see the opportunity present itself to us. But, broadly, the trends are there going in the right direction, and we like where we sit. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC Could you give us any more color on the rates of growth as opposed to, yes, it's nice. I mean, that's a pretty anemic way of describing the numbers relative to what you could provide? François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. Well, Alex, I think we can say that the three areas that you've mentioned, security, software/virtual additions and public cloud, are all growing faster than our overall revenues. In this case of security, I did mention earlier that we saw very strong double-digit growth in the quarter. In the case of the public cloud, I think we've said before, it is actually growing even faster than security, but from a very small base to start with. But I actually have some color for you, Alex, having been here just a few weeks. One of the areas of surprise for me was  a pleasant surprise  was to see how much we, as a company, are already doing in the public cloud on the various models, perpetual licenses, subscription, also the number of customers buying our Virtual Edition by the drink (47:44) as a utility, by the hour. And the number of hours we're billing in the public cloud is growing extremely rapidly. So these are all areas of growth with  right now, some more meaningful than others. I'd say, probably of these three overall software, as you know, as a percentage of our business is pretty large. So that's a meaningful contribution. Public cloud isn't yet a meaningful contribution. And security is growing and kind of in between those two. Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Jason Willey - F5 Networks, Inc. Robert, I think we'll take one more question. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you very much. And, Francois, my congratulations to you as well. Andy, I was hoping you can expand on the weakness you saw in services. I was a little surprised to see it flat sequentially and, looking back, you guys have never had a flat sequential quarter in services before. And when we chatted at a conference in mid-February, I think you were still seeing at that point consistent attach rates and renewals. So maybe just give us a little more detail on what happened with the end-of-life products that you were referencing there and how we should think about that going forward? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. And actually the way to look at this is, we're modeling it is, sequentially it was basically flat, up $0.5 million. We think off of this new base we start to go to more normal growth rates again. And really the driver to that is, we did end of life a number of older boxes. I think they averaged over 7 years old and they did have strong attach rates to them, still renewal rates. The impact of it, frankly, I just  I missed the modeling on it and the impact was bigger than I anticipated. So that's where we ended up. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. So maybe just to be clear on that because I think you've said before that you've got something like 40,000 units in the installed base that are over 5 years. So of these over 7-year-old end-of-life products, are there any additional ones that might stop maintenance in the coming quarters? And has that now been factored into the expectation that this is the bottom? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yeah. I don't think we're going to see anything in the short-term, and we'd advise you of that. I would highlight surrounding this discussion that our deferred revenue was pretty strong in the quarter. So we saw that go up 10%, and the majority of that is annual maintenance. So I would look at that too to balance the expectations. But as I said, when we started, we now think, off of this new base, it's a bit of reset, but we're going to start sequentially growing again at least in rough dollar basis consistent with what you've seen in the past. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just a quick one. I might have missed it. But did you say what percent software was as a percent of total revenue this quarter? Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. No. We didn't break that out. No. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. Thanks, Simona. Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc. Yes. Thank you. Jason Willey - F5 Networks, Inc. All right. Thank you. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you again in three months. Have a good rest of your day. François Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today as we present our fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 year-end results. Let us begin by turning to slide 2 for our fourth quarter income statement highlights. Our performance this quarter was consistent with our expectations and aligned to the guidance ranges on all of our key financial metrics we provided in January, reflecting our continued operational execution, portfolio evolution and commitment to our Sketch-to-Scale strategy. Our revenue totaled $5.9 billion, which was at the high end of our guidance range as all four of our business groups met or exceeded our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, our quarterly revenue increased $90 million or 2%. Mike will provide additional insight into our business group revenue and the demand environment shortly. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $205 million, which was above the midpoint the of our guidance range of $185 million to $215 million and expanded 2% year-over-year. Adjusted net income was $156 million. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter was $0.29, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.27 to $0.31, while our GAAP EPS was $0.16. Now turn to slide 3 for our trended quarterly financial highlights. Our fourth quarter adjusted gross profit totaled $419 million and our adjusted gross margin was 7.1%. This marks our second-highest level ever of adjusted gross profit dollars generated in the fourth quarter, despite having lower quarterly revenue today. Our improving adjusted gross profit and gross margin are being supported by our strategic evolution and a structural mix shift to higher margin end markets, while we are also providing greater levels of innovation and design and engineering services. Our strengthening gross margin and disciplined discretionary spending enables Flex to continue to make investments to support our long-term vision and growth. Our SG&A expense amounted to $214 million, which was modestly up both sequentially and year-over-year. The expansion of SG&A is reflective of incremental design and engineering investments as we expand our innovation and design centers, and we continue to absorb incremental costs associated with our acquisitions, which carry higher SG&A levels than some of our legacy businesses. We are consciously elevating the levels of our spend to support our new business models and investing across all aspects of our platform. And we will anticipate more of our operating expense to be directed at funding our Sketch-to-Scale portfolio shift. Our quarterly adjusted operating income came in at $205 million and our adjusted operating margin was 3.5%. While a modest margin increase year-over-year, it represented our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. More importantly, our annual adjusted operating margin is up 20 basis point from 3.2% in fiscal 2016 to 3.4% in fiscal 2017. Return on invested capital, or ROIC, remained stable and strong at 20% and continues to be well above our cost of capital. Turning to slide 4, we display our operating performance by business group. Our CEC business generated $53 million in adjusted operating profit and posted a 2.7% adjusted operating margin, which was within our targeted range of 2.5% to 3.5%. The sequential decline of profitability is driven by lower revenue levels, resulting in lower overhead absorption, increased pricing pressures, and increased investments to expand our converged infrastructure capabilities. Our CTG business produced $41 million in adjusted operating profit, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 2.7%, which is within our targeted range of 2% to 4% for this business. When looking at the sequential decline in margin, it was driven almost entirely by the 17% seasonal revenue decline and the associated absorption impacts. In addition, we had elevated levels of ramp costs from new programs, which were partially offset by the benefit from better-than-expected execution on certain products, which were going end of life. Our IEI business generated $53 million in adjusted operating profit and achieved a 4.1% adjusted operating margin. This was consistent with our expectations as our semi-cap equipment business displayed solid growth, and our solar tracker business recaptured demand from the utility scale project push-outs and delays experienced in the prior quarters. Lastly, our HRS business continue to display strong operational execution, as it delivered $84 million in adjusted operating profit, equating to an 8% adjusted operating margin. This consistent, solid operating performance demonstrates strong operational management as we continue to successfully ramp multiple new customers and programs within both our auto and medical markets. We are pleased with HRS's ability to operate effectively within its targeted long-term margin range of 6% to 9% while continuing to make investments to increase our engineering and technical competencies and advanced innovation solutions. Please turn to slide 5 for our other income statement comments. Net interest and other expense for the quarter was $34 million, which was above our guidance of $25 million to $30 million, primarily reflecting the impact from increasing interest rates and lower foreign currency gains. As we move forward we are raising our quarterly guidance for this line item to the range of $30 million to $35 million, as it better reflects the impact of higher interest rates that affect our floating rate debt. Our adjusted income tax expense for the fourth quarter was approximately $15 million, reflecting an adjusted income tax rate of approximately 9%. As I've discussed in the past, we foresee a gradual increase in our effective tax rate over the next several years due to our earnings mix shifting with a greater concentration in higher tax jurisdictions as well as increased uncertainties given the global tax environment. Therefore, we are increasing and broadening our long-term tax rate range to 10% to 15%, and we anticipate executing to the lower end of that range in fiscal 2018. There's several different elements that have an impact when reconciling between our GAAP and our adjusted EPS. There's a $0.03 impact from the $15 million of stock-based compensation expense and another $0.03 impact from the $17 million of net intangible amortization expense. And lastly, we recognized $37 million or $0.07 from employee termination and other costs, as we completed the targeted restructuring we previously had announced. These targeted efforts enable us to move away from certain legacy activities, and we have reinvested a majority of the cost savings from these actions into growth areas of our portfolio and our platform. Now turning to slide 6, let us review our strong cash flow generation. We continue to generate strong operating cash flows, which enables us to operate, invest, and grow our business. We generated $137 million of cash flow from operations in Q4, which marked the 11th straight quarter of greater than $100 million of cash flow from operations. This also pushed our operating cash flow generation to almost $1.2 billion for the year. Net working capital remained relatively flat at $1.6 billion and amounted to 6.9% of our net sales, illustrating our disciplined working capital management. We continue to drive multiple actions to improve our inventory management and we are pleased that we have successfully driven our inventory down to $3.4 billion, which is the lowest level in almost four years. Our cash conversion cycle totaled 24 days, which improved by three days over year ago. We believe that our current and prospective business mix will continue to result in our net working capital as a percentage of sales to remain within our targeted range of 6% to 8%. Our capital investment remains disciplined, while we continue to drive automation and innovation investments and fulfill our planned capability and capacity expansion. This quarter our net capital expenditures totaled $104 million, which was slightly below our depreciation level of $107 million. For the year, we invested $490 million to bring our total capital expenditure investment to over $1.2 billion over the past three years as we have invested in our platform and evolving businesses. Our resulting free cash flow was $33 million in the quarter. For fiscal 2017, we generated $660 million, which was above the midpoint of our targeted range of $600 million to $700 million. This performance capped a very successful five-year run that saw us generate over $3.2 billion. Impressively, our 10-year free cash flow generation was $6.3 billion, which is nearly three-quarters of our current market cap. Our strong, sustainable cash flow generation enables us to consistently return value to shareholders through repurchasing of our shares. This quarter we repurchased 5.7 million shares, or 1% of our float, for approximately $90 million, and we returned over 50% of our fiscal free cash flow to shareholders as committed. Please turn to slide 7 to review our balanced capital structure. We continue to operate with a strong financial condition, maintaining over $3.3 billion in liquidity, no near-term debt maturities and over $1.8 billion in cash. Our credit metrics remain healthy with our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 2.4 times. So, as we close out our fiscal 2017, we are very pleased with our ability to deliver on our financial commitments, sustain a strong cash flow generation, operate a flexible and balanced capital structure and continue to evolve our portfolio. We're taking distinct actions to further strengthen our Sketch-to-Scale supply chain solutions and to increase the attractiveness of our long-term business model. We'll continue to operate with discipline and consistently deliver on our commitments. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Thanks, Chris. Please turn to slide 8 for fiscal year 2017 business highlights. As we reflect on the year's performance, we are very pleased to deliver to our shareholders consistent, multiyear growth in earnings per share, operating margin expansion, strong free cash flow and consistent share repurchases while we continued to invest in our platform and evolve our portfolio to longer product life cycles and higher margin businesses. For fiscal year 2017, our operating profit dollars totaled over $815 million, $23.5 million above fiscal 2016. Our adjusted operating margin for the year was 3.4%, which was a 16-year high. We are thrilled to have delivered 14 straight quarters of year-over-year operating margin expansion. Our evolving business mix and improved operational execution has enabled us to achieve our 21st consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding consensus EPS. We have built a business model that generates outstanding free cash flow consistently year after year. We have generated positive operating cash flow in 23 of our past 24 quarters and positive free cash flow in 11 straight quarters. For the year, cash flow from operations totaled $1.15 billion and free cash flow was $660 million. Our strong cash flow generation is a hallmark for Flex and provides us the ability to make the investments necessary to successfully expand our platform beyond our traditional businesses. We will realize continued margin expansion and accelerated growth as a result of a substantial amount of new TAM from these new industries. A great example of entirely new industries that have better economics and long-term profit potentials is seen with our Nike partnership. Let me start by stating that this strategic partnership continues to work very well with both companies fully committed to success, both this year and over the next decade. We are accelerating our investments in Nike on the back of early automation successes, a strong customer collaboration and broad-based opportunities. While we will have some acceleration in our investments in the next couple of quarters, our previous outlined expectation to reach operational productivity or profitability as we exit fiscal 2018 remains intact. In addition, we announced a new joint venture with RIB Software in Germany, called YTWO Formative. The joint venture is focused on transforming the building and housing industry. It does this by digitizing the design through supply chain process, leveraging the combination of RIB's 5D BIM software and Flex's platform of operational scale and world-class supply chain systems. Together, we can build a smarter, more connected system, using modern software architecture and real-time information. We believe that our offering can reduce costs by up to 50%, shorten cycle times, improve efficiencies and help complete construction projects on schedule. The initial traction we are seeing from the targeted customer base has been very strong. We booked our first customer this past quarter, who is a major European developer, and are deep in conversations with several other sizable builders in each of our three main target geographies of Europe, the U.S. and Asia. As I have discussed, we're actively investing in our future. It is our objective to achieve a balanced blend of investments in our platform to position our company for the future, while returning value to shareholders. We continue to fulfill our commitment to return value back to shareholders and bought back approximately $90 million worth of stock or nearly 6 million shares. For the year, we repurchased nearly 25 million shares or almost 5% of our float for $350 million. This is over 50% of our free cash flow. And as Chris stated, we remain committed to continue to return over 50% of free cash flow to investors on an annual basis. Please turn to slide 9 as we review revenue by business group in detail. Before I go into the details of each business group, I wanted to mention that we had no 10% or greater customers for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our top-10 customers accounted for 43% of sales for fiscal 2017, which is down from 46% from fiscal 2016. Our diversification is truly a unique quality, which differentiates Flex from competitors. Additionally, we operate at scale in so many different industries that we have more insights into more industries, more geographies, and more technologies than virtually any other company today. I can't emphasize enough how valuable this is, as most products in the future will be systems and will be a combination of multiple technologies. Leveraging these technologies across industries will be the competitive differentiation of the future and incredibly difficult to duplicate. Now turning to our business groups. CEC was in line with our expectation for a sequential revenue decline of 5% to 10%, as it came down 6% to $1.98 billion. For fiscal 2017 CEC declined 5% as anticipated. The decline was mostly due to structural weakness in legacy server and storage, down over 30% year-over-year, modest weakness in networking and telecom, offset only slightly by our continued success in our converged infrastructure and cloud offering, or CI3, which experienced double-digit growth. For the June quarter, we expect CEC revenue to be down 5% to 15% on a year-over-year basis and we once again expect to see growth in CI3 being offset by weakness in the rest of the CEC business. CTG saw less of a seasonal revenue decline than we anticipated, declining 17% sequentially versus our expectations of a 20% to 30% drop. For fiscal 2017, CTG was down 9%, or over $600 million, due entirely to the exit of the China Motorola Lenovo business, which accounted for roughly $900 million reduction. Excluding this impact, CTG grew year-over-year. For the June quarter, we are guiding CTG revenue to increase 5% to 15% year-over-year driven by Bose and new programs, offset by the end of life of certain legacy programs and game consoles and wrist wearables. IEI rebounded strongly this quarter as forecasted. Revenue rose 14% sequentially, at the high end of our guidance range for a 10% to 15% increase, and reflecting an all-time high quarterly revenue. Strength in capital equipment and solar trackers led the way, along with additional support of industrial home and lifestyle products. For fiscal 2017, IEI grew nearly $300 million or 6% year-over-year with growth in almost all major segments. And while below our 10% long-term target, this is actually very impressive when you consider the greater than $300 million year-over-year impact IEI needed to absorb from its largest customer, SunEdison, going bankrupt. IEI bookings have been exceptional the past couple of quarters and we expect that strength will support our future growth targets. The bookings were achieved across a broad range of industries including appliances, energy, lifestyles and capital equipment. For the June quarter we are forecasting IEI sales to be flat to up 5% year-over-year, as new programs in energy and appliances partially offset by declines in capital and office equipment. HRS was in line with guidance, growing 2% sequentially versus expectations of flat to up 5%. The growth was entirely due to automotive, as medical declined sequentially. HRS's streak of achieving year-over-year quarterly growth extended to 29 straight quarters. For fiscal 2017, HRS grew 6% or $250 million, mostly driven by automotive, which eclipsed 10% growth. In our June quarter, we expect HRS to be up 5% to 10% year-over-year, which is a function of automotive growth led by our AGM acquisition, which we closed early in Q1, coupled with gains in automotive lighting, being offset by declines from a few medical customers. Let's turn to our June quarter guidance on slide 10. Our expectation is for revenue to be in the range of $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion. Our guidance for adjusted operating income is in the range of $170 million to $200 million and reflective of our accelerated investment levels we are anticipating for several of our new businesses as we invest in their future growth as I discussed earlier. This equates to an adjusted EPS guidance range of $0.24 to $0.28 per share based on weighted average shares outstanding of 538 million. The adjusted EPS guidance is expected to be approximately $0.08 higher than the quarterly GAAP earnings per diluted share due to net intangible amortization and stock-based compensation. As I conclude, I want to thank my team at Flex for helping to drive a very successful fiscal 2017 full of new records and milestones. With that, I'd like to open up the call for Q&A. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Your first question is from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you very much. Good afternoon. So, it looks like earnings have kind of flattened out here, and you talked about interest expense going up, the tax rate going up, at least in the short term, investments going up. How does this play into the 12% EPS growth that you're looking for over a number of years? Is that still the goal? And is that going to tend to be a little more backend loaded now? Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. Hi, Steve. This is Chris. And we have a great opportunity in 10 days to even unpack this further with you at our Investor Day. But now  but you'll see, and I don't want to jump what we're going to talk about in another 10 days, but our long-term model remains intact. Some of those points that you just highlighted, we'd highlighted were implicit in that range when we talked about it last year in the 2020 Vision. What you also heard today was the company making conscious decisions to make investments and accelerate investments across some of our new business models and initiatives that are taking shape earlier in this year. So, we're going to spend some time with you in another 10 days, you and our investors, to take you through that long-term vision that remains intact and also gives us the confidence to start putting forth some of these investments into the current periods here. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Can you be more explicit on the investments that you're making this coming year? What's the incremental investment? And where is it showing up? Is it gross margin? SG&A? What's your CapEx plan and so forth? Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. Certainly. The investments that I was alluding to there were more centered around the P&L. Okay? And if you look at how we've guided the first quarter here, you're seeing those investments show up in terms of both in gross profit as well as in SG&A. So, I talked about the incremental levels of investment around our research and development, design and engineering, expanding the innovation centers. That's going to be reflective in an SG&A as well as, as you see us bringing on some new acquisitions, I had also highlighted those are going to have incremental SG&A contributions. So at the front end of this year, when you have those investments coming in and you do not have any top-line growth, you're going to see more of a margin type of an impact. Mike also alluded to and talked through the investment levels that we're driving in terms of Nike. What you're seeing there is more operational that are going to be more reflective in our gross margin and gross profit implications. So those two alone  those activities right there equate to what you see when you put a guide out that we have that centered around $0.26 at the midpoint. So if you look, we're down sequentially roughly $20 million and all of that will be identified through these incremental investments and the shifts that we're seeing here. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Great. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Good afternoon, guys. I guess a couple questions from me. First of all, Nike. It sounds like you're accelerating the investments right now and I think Nike's CEO talked on their call about seeing tens of millions of dollars of gross margin benefit from partners like Flex, and that number should go up. So I'm curious, is the revenue trajectory and your expectations on revenues starting to inflect? Is that happening a little bit earlier with Nike? Could you just maybe update us on that dynamic? Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yeah, let me just talk a little bit about Nike more broadly. I think what some of the comments you're getting out of Nike  and we obviously see the same thing because we work hand in hand with them all the way from a design center, all the way to the factory floor, is that we're seeing the potential and the possibilities in front of us that are pretty significant. And we believe this whole concept of reinventing how shoes are manufactured is really alive and well. We're starting to get early successes around some of the design engagements that we're having about reinventing how design actually occurs, some of the new technologies of the shoes, and even into the automation projects that we're seeing. So what's happening is it's our objective and their objective, of course, is to try to accelerate these coming and take advantage of these benefits. So, the short-term impact of that is going to be higher operating expenses. If I think about what we're trying to do more specifically on the factory floor, we have all different models  a number of different models that we have to introduce into the floor. We have new technologies. We have automation. We have to re-optimize the supply chain for the new locations. We're taking and making improvements all the way back to the  or changes back to the design process, all the way back into Nike. And at the same time, hiring 12,000 people is the goal over a 15-month period. So, you can imagine doing all these kind of things at once and kind of reinventing how shoe manufacturing occurs at the same time. So, it's kind of a long answer, but the short of it is, all this is creating some pressure on the gross margin level. We're creating pressure on the gross margin level because we actually see the possibilities. And the amount of TAM that's available to Flex and the amount of opportunity for us to really help Nike is going to be pretty extraordinary, because $1 billion is just a small percentage of what they actually produce. And the one last thing I would finish with is we continue to be hopeful that despite the incremental operating investments that we'll do over the next couple of quarters, that by the time we get into Q4, we'll cross over into profits. And then it is  hopefully the learning is behind us. And ideally, as we move into FY 2019 and 2020 and 2021, it's really just about revenue expansion or supply expansion in number of shoes we built, and the learning curve is predominantly over. So hopefully, I answered your question. I know it was probably more than you were looking for, but that kind of outlines what we're trying to accomplish with Nike and what we think the possibilities are. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC No, more is always better, so appreciate that. Just if I think about the expense and the investments you guys are doing though right now, and of course, it seems like maybe it's a 30 basis point, 40 basis point margin impact in the June quarter guide. How long do you think that sustains? And does that sustain essentially all the way through March of 2017? Or do we start to see the revenue and leverage come in a bit quicker broadly in the model? Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. I think there's two parts to that. I think there's both the Nike and then the other investments. What we see is we see on the Nike side that sustaining for a couple of quarters, and we go back to the statement Mike just made in his prepared as well as how he closed, we have ourselves crossing over into profits in the last quarter of this next fiscal year, fiscal 2018. So that's the change on that piece. We anticipate seeing a much stronger second half for Flex this coming year. And with that incremental level of revenues, you're going see the leverage on the other investments that we're making inside of the R&D and other efforts that are putting some pressure on this near term. So the second half of the year for us is going to be much stronger. It's going to show the leverage. It's going to help us drive the profitability back up. And you also have a Nike shifting back into crossing into profits at the end of the next year. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. And I'll just give you a little more color in terms of some of the investments that we're really excited about, but I think about YTWO, I think the adoption that we're having and the conversation we're having in the marketplace is way above expectations. We already talked about Nike, so I don't need to talk about the excitement we have there about trying to accelerate what we can do there. We mentioned the IEI wins that are going to take a little bit of investment as we go into there, but they had record  they've had a number of different record bookings over the last few quarters, which is going to drive a lot of  which is going to secure their long-term revenue targets. We talked about AGM that we just brought on. We have to convert computer systems and absorb that. That'll take about two quarters. And quite frankly, on the Bose program, we probably have another quarter, quarter and a half of investment to get that whole business into our system. So while all these things are hitting kind of a lot more aggressively in the first and second quarter, a lot of them are on the back of just the success that we're having in terms of what we're seeing in the marketplace. So we're pretty excited to have them. We made a conscious decision to allow those investments to run and will actually play into second half with a much stronger revenue and with a revenue that's going to accelerate into FY 2019. So, that's kind of the play that we're running right now and we're pretty pleased with it. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Perfect. Thanks a lot and see you guys at the Analyst Day. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Thank you. Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks and good afternoon. Chris, you talked about a $20 million sequential increase related to the investments. Can you just give us a sense of the total investment, how much is Nike versus other, and what the leverage is dependent upon? Meaning, are there guaranteed volumes associated with this? Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. Certainly, Adam. And the $20 million was just a reference to equate to the Q4 operating profit and then a midpoint of guidance. So I wasn't being explicit as to the amount of those investments. But specifically, we're not quantifying with our partner, Nike, around what that level of investment is right now. We're just talking about the accelerated level that's going to be reflected in our performance. The relationship with Nike, as Mike says, continue to be strong. It's probably deeper than it was at any other stage right now. We're completely aligned with the production curve and we're continuing to manage that relationship as we go forward. I don't know what more I'm going to add with regard to that except that the investments have been a conscious level decision by the company that's necessary for us to move to accelerate the business model that we're getting after. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. And operating profit dollars, looks like they're going to decline year-over-year based on your guidance. How temporary is this? And I know your target is a CAGR, but do you think you can grow operating profit dollars over 10% in fiscal 2018? Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. We're going to have an ability to go more deeper on our long-term model in another 10 days. Our progress  what you will hear from us is that we're not moving off of our 2020 Vision, and we're going to unpack for you all the different areas that provide us that confidence as to how we move that 2020 Vision. That journey to 2020 is not going to be linear. You're seeing that evidence right now. Each quarter it will change with regards to the level of investments required from the company to post up, and secure, and capture those future profitable business streams. So, I'm not going to give you a 2018 view. I would tell you that it will not be at a 10% growth. We're going to be able to show you in another 10 days different elements of what stands behind the growth across each of the businesses and in total as we make the journey towards 2020. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the questions. So, the first question is a follow-up question around the elevated expenses. Should we think about the magnitude of the incremental expenses being larger in the September quarter as maybe the size of some of these pull-in programs starts to increase in scale? And then maybe you can just  I just want to be a bit more clear on how exactly those expenses go away as you move through the year. It sounds like maybe the revenue just comes in to get leverage on those expenses, or is  that's probably the primary reason that the impact goes away later this calendar year? Or are there some one-off, either SG&A or product development type expenses, that are truly  they just go away on an absolute basis as you move through the year? Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. Certainly, Mark. Let me try to  I think I got everything that you just asked. So, yeah, if I was to think about as you move forward, you should see a September quarter that'd be very similar in terms of that level of investment. There's nothing that's going to be accelerating. I think it's going to be very similar. And what you have when I describe the investments we're taking right now in terms of the design engineering, the expansion of innovation centers and that installed capacity, capability and competency, that's essentially coming in fixed. So as you think about those being put in place, you see a back half of the year that's much stronger in terms of the revenue and the volumes, and you're going to see that leverage play through. So you're going to see a leverage model that starts helping to drive the margin and profit dollars improving as you go through the year. And then, specifically, if you tie back to the Nike discussion that we've been having, Nike is going to be one in which we also start having greater revenues, greater execution. And so, as that changes in the back end of the year and we start moving out to come out of the back end of that year with profitability on that, that's also going to provide further leverage, further earnings upside, if you will. So, I think the way you describe it is exactly how we envision it. We're going to spend a little more time with you and others in another 10 days to get deeper on some of those attributes, but these are conscious decisions where we sit today to invest into the business with a long-term focus around discrete areas that are going to be revenue generative and truly operational profit generative. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yeah. That's helpful, Chris. Just a quick follow-up on that point and then I just have a second question. The quick follow-up is just the return on invested capital I think running around 20% for the company. These incremental investments that you're making, are they consistent with that sort of return profile going forward? And then my other question was on the high reliability business seeing nice year-over-year growth. Obviously, that's where your auto business is. A few semi companies have talked about seeing some deceleration in auto and I think North America is seeing some slowdown in SAAR. I understand Flex has been gaining content and expanding internationally, but is there anything you're factoring into your guidance on the auto side to maybe account for any unit SAAR type of slowdown if in fact that is occurring? Thank you. Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. Certainly, Mark. Yeah, and thank you for the first point on the investment level, because someone asked that earlier, and it is two parts. I've been talking a lot about the investment we're doing in terms of the P&L. There's also CapEx. As we think about CapEx for this coming year, it's going to be very similar to what we just printed this past year and before. I think there's nothing more elevated in terms of that capital investment being required by the company as we continue to invest in the platform and continue to invest in capability and capacity around the growing areas of the business. So that would be in check. What you do see is with a slightly lower profitability, you'll put a little pressure on the return profile, which puts a little pressure on the ROIC. I think you'll see us relatively consistent around the ROIC. It will have a little pressure at the front end, but it should be coming back up and sustain itself well in the range around the 20% and well above our weighted average cost of capital. So as I try to answer your second question, and that was related to how we think about auto, we couldn't be more pleased with the position we have inside of auto. And I think we've talked before with regards to what we've been seeing. These SAAR is something that we're very aware of and the production associated with those volumes. But for our offering, it's been more around the complete expansion of the services and capabilities that we have. Our auto content continues to grow very healthily. If you look back, you had 2008 where we were roughly around $25 per content in a car, this year we're coming out roughly around $118 of content in a car. So some real solid, double-digit growth, and we're seeing that go forward. You heard our announcement about AGM. AGM, we're super-excited about that strategic acquisition. It again provides us more capability inside of interior lighting and overhead consoles, and it just is another tool in which we can take what is a truly global platform that we're operating today with great meaningful partnerships and over 300 global platforms and continue to increase that. So we're getting growth in many different ways. Our guidance reflects not just some benefit from AGM, but also continue growth inside of auto that was very strong this past year. So, I think that's kind of  I'm trying to give you as much color as I can as to how I thought through that. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yeah. And pretty much, Mark... Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. ...year-after-year, we've beat our growth rate as we overachieved the SAAR levels. And while we'd like to have them be higher, they're not a requirement in order for us to hit the growth targets, unless they fall off like meaningfully. But so far they're pretty flat. The expectation is for them to be pretty flat. And we run reasonably independently, because we've been achieving double-digit growth rates for many, many years now. And as we look forward and we look at our book of business, we actually think going forward we will continue to have some double-digit growth near term. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Welcome. Operator The next question is from Jim Suva from Citi. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks very much. A quick clarification question, then I'll ask my main question. First, the clarification question. Does your guidance include the AGM Automotive acquisition? And if so, how should we think about that as far as magnitude? Just trying to figure out organic versus inorganic growth. And then my main question is on the CEC guidance, many of us on this call also cover many of those customers, and none of them are seeing such a big decline year-over-year. So, can you help us understand, are you transitioning off some programs or are some programs winding down? Are you walking away from some business? Could you lose some, because that CEC decline is quite material year-over-year? Thank you. Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. Thank you, Jim. Let me just start with the AGM. So the AGM is included in our current guidance. And it is a component  and I believe I answered this earlier, it is a component of the growth inside of HRS that we've identified for this next period, which is up 5% to 10% year-over-year. We're also seeing growth inside of our core automotive offering, and some modest growth inside of HRS. So it is part and parcel to the entire guidance framework there. I think we talked about AGM in our announcement when we talked about closing that. And what you still need to think about AGM for us is it's going to be accretive to earnings this year. It's going to be accretive to cash flow this year. Obviously, it's not a material transaction. It's a nice strategic transaction that is providing us some real complementary lighting and overhead console business. It's allowing us to really capture some more market share. It really does a nice job of balancing out North America and our Europe lighting offering. It accelerates some positions with some really strategic OEMs. It also just was announced that in 2016 it won the GM Innovation Award. So, there's all these other features that get us excited about what AGM does to the portfolio. But how you should think about it, it's completely inclusive. I would say that it's a big component of the HRS guide, but we're also growing inside of the core automotive and medical. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yeah. And just to address your CEC question, Jim, I think the best way to look at it is on an annual basis our CEC business was down about 5%. I expect that's probably not too far off of your benchmarks of how hardware's trending in with the other  with the OEMs. More specifically, on the quarter, the quarter's actually flat sequentially if you look at it on a sequential basis. And on the quarterly basis on the Q1 FY 2018, the Q1 2017 is a pretty tough comp. But I think the important part to think about as well on this is there's just more and more commoditization in the space, and as there moves to be more and more commoditization and revenue is hard to come, there's a lot of capacity out there and there's a lot of companies that have capacity that can build products like this. And what that does is it push margins down. And as you push margins down this space, it comes with inventory turns that run probably closer in the floor range. So, you actually  as the margins come down and returns are pressured as a result of plenty of capacity and movement to more and more commoditization structurally, it's going to be more and more challenging for us to invest in those kind of programs as opposed to focusing our investments where we have like a lot of different opportunities. And I think a lot  so a lot of that is just structural and I think you'll probably see more of it over time. The one thing that's unique to that is the CIC  or the CI3, where we continue to invest in, which is our cloud initiative. We continue to have double-digit growth and we expect a pretty strong growth rates over this next year. So, we're trying to reestablish our system to be very, very focused on where the OEMs need the future to be as opposed to chasing kind of a lower margin commoditized play with kind of rough inventory turns of kind of the past. So anyways, I think there's a lot of different pieces of that that you have to consider, but this is how we think about the business structurally going forward. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you for the details. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. You're welcome. Operator Your next question is from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ruplu Bhattacharya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Mike, can you just talk a little bit more about the IEI segment? Margins were back in the 4% to 6% range and I guess revenues were up mid-single digits for the year. You talked about some program wins. So how should we think about revenues? Can they accelerate in fiscal 2018 and can you get to the midpoint of the 4% to 6% range exiting the year? Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yeah. So, the first thing I'd say is I'd wait for more color on that as we get into the Analyst Day. But if you step back and just think about the IEI performance, it has continuous margin improvement. In FY 2015 for the year, we did 3% operating profit. In FY 2016, we did 3.4%. In FY 2017, we just finished with 3.6%, and that was like pretty tough with SunEdison being such a substantial portion of that, we lost all that margin contribution there. Closed the year at 4.1%, so we're obviously moving in a very, very positive direction. If you couple that with the fact that we're having, over the last few quarters, just record bookings, and if you'll note I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we actually believe these bookings will set us up to hit the long-term growth rates in IEI which, as you know, are 10%. So I think we continue to make very nice progress, and we're very, very bullish about the future and even immediately in FY 2018. But I would just ask you to wait for a little bit more detail as we'll be together again in 10 days and we'll be outlining our more long-term vision for this segment then. Ruplu Bhattacharya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up. You talked about CTG being a little bit better. This quarter it came in down 17% versus your guidance of down 20% to 30%. So just wondering, was there any particular area of strength? And also in that segment, did you, Mike, say that you need another quarter or maybe quarter and a half of investments in Bose? I would have thought Bose would be profitable by now, but maybe there's more investments there. So if you can just clarify that. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yeah. No, I think when you think about Bose  so CTG is kind of a mix of business. There's some seasonal implications and I think we're going to see a lot less seasonality going forward based on the mix they have. On the Bose business, they're definitely profitable. It's just that we've not optimized the profitability yet because the integration of the computer systems and the optimization of the factory with Flex systems as such is really not yet complete. So it usually takes anywhere from two to four quarters to really ultimately achieve a full what I would almost call synergy associated with the Flex systems. So that would be one of the structural elements. When we talk about the investments in the next couple of quarters that are pressuring our operating margins that will be one of those investments that will go away by the time we get to the third quarter. And so, in time that will work its way out pretty positively. But we're already  it's already positively contributing. It's just not at the margin targets yet that we'd like to see. Ruplu Bhattacharya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. And I would just expand just a little bit on that just to say in the current quarter, we did have some benefits from some legacy programs that went end of life. So, that was a contributor favorably. But again, think about CTG, we're on a path to enabling commercialization of products in new industries, it's about a richer mix. So it's not always going to be about the revenue growth here. And the Bose comments that Mike just shared with you are not a departure at all. I mean, we've been talking a lot about Bose not being accretive to our margins in the first several quarters. So, we're very pleased with how we're moving along with that foundational element of our future and you're going to continue to see a growth profile inside of CTG. Ruplu Bhattacharya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Great. Thank you. Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. You're welcome. Operator The next question is from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC Thanks very much. Just two quick ones for me. First, I believe last year you had a concentration of capital spending around two served markets and I was just curious can you give us a sense for the focus on CapEx this year or maybe a rough level of it. And then secondly, like you mentioned the medical business has been a little bit depressed. So, I was curious if you have a sense for when that might turn and start seeing growth again? Thanks. Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. So with regards to the capital, I had highlighted earlier that we're going to be able to provide a better detail here in another 10 days at the Investor Day as regarding our capital allocation and capital investment as we move forward through 2020. But as I alluded to earlier, you should be anticipating 2018 to be on a very similar level of investment as this past year. As you highlighted, we've been making some concentrated capacity and capability investments in some of our growth areas. HRS has been one of those areas for us. And as I think about what we've done, we've put nearly $350 million into CapEx over the last several years into that business to support its expansion, to support its capability. So, you're going to see a very similar dispersion of our capital investment this coming year and in another 10 days I'll be able to give you a little bit better insight into some of those both in 2018 and beyond. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yeah. And on the medical business, we're planning on doing a pretty good deep dive with you on the strategy for medical over the  and what our expectations are for the coming years. The medical hardware business itself actually does not have much of a growth rate. If you start to separate out all the acquisitions and the effects of those acquisitions, it's actually pretty flat. And if you  also believe it or not, the acquisitions themselves, which we tend to see a lot of them, have actually called out some of the programs they've already awarded. As our customers went, focused on the integration as opposed to focused on the optimization, which is where a company like Flex comes in. So, it slows things down a little bit and we're experiencing that. At the same time, we've done some pretty significant investments in digital health where we brought on a whole new division that is focused specifically on trying to drive digital health and leveraging some of the technologies we have much more broadly than just the medical piece, but also into the connected home and the wearables. And we're going to give you a number of different  we'll give you some updates on that as we go forward and we'll talk about some of the expansion of the new markets that we're having in medical. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC Great. Thank you very much. Kevin Kessel - Flex Ltd. Operator, we're coming up to the top of the hour here, and I know there are a lot of earnings so we have time for one final question at this time. Operator The last question is from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. So, a couple of questions. On the CEC business, understand the areas of weakness, but you did talk about, Mike, opportunities in the cloud infrastructure and cloud computing area. How big is that business now for you? And how is the opportunity in terms of it moving the needle, offsetting the weakness in some of the areas that you talked about? Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yeah. So, right now, it's over $1 billion. We've got probably 18 new logos in it. You've probably seen some of our participation in the Open Compute platform and a number of different industries where we've moved into even almost a leadership position in terms of thinking how some of the changes should unfold. So we'll see it grow. It's probably not big enough yet to offset any kind of structural declines in the more commoditized part of the business. But we're super-excited about it. And if I think about the future, it's not just in terms of what CI3 can do, but it's really important to think about the advent and when 5G comes along, and then the telco cloud, which is still a couple years out. But we're actually positioning some of our investments pretty heavily to take advantage of 5G and telco cloud and be in a leadership position in those places. So, it's not big enough to offset the structural declines and some of the possibilities for like 5G and telco cloud are out a couple of years. So, we're going to have investments over the next couple of years, I think, that are not necessarily going to offset the decline. But that's what we're trying to do and we'll see how it goes. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. And then just lastly, we've heard from several of your competitors and customers about memory shortages, SSD shortages impacting revenue opportunities. We're seeing inventory build at some competitors and even seeing lead-times strength  lengthen on other components. Are you seeing that at all? Your inventories look pretty clean, just trying to figure out what you're seeing in that area. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yes. So we are seeing it. We are seeing lead times push out. A lot of it we've anticipated. We're having some impacts to revenue, but it's not material at this point. And we do know a lot of customers are giving us a really, really  are starting to build up inventory, and hopefully they won't create a shortage as a result of people hoarding inventory. But we are actually in pretty good balance and able to get most of the inventory, and not seeing any real impact to our revenue at this point. And the one thing I would add is we've done a tremendous amount of investment in our real-time systems about how we're able to look at the inventory and look at the visibility in the supply chain. We've done a lot of investments in something that we call Pulse, which is our own internal system to really get real-time visibility of inventory across the supply chain. We've been doing implementations like Elementum, which is obviously a leader in SaaS based visibility in the supply chain, where we're using them to help us manage our inventory and our visibility, and we've driven a lot of systems to be real time with our people. So, I think those kind of changes have made a huge impact on our visibility into the supply chain and our ability to manage inventory. And you actually see another impact of that where you actually see our work in process has actually come down quite a bit, and we've got some of the best inventory turns we've had in a while. So, we actually feel it, we see it. We don't feel it too bad, because I think we are a bit ahead of it. But again, without question, lead times are pushing out on a number of different products. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Thanks a lot. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Let's close. I want to thank everybody for attending the call. Our Sketch-to-Scale strategy continues to show a lot of promise. There is plenty of evidence to support our sustained business evolution. This quarter, once again, was our 14th straight quarter of year-over-year adjusted operating margin growth. Our free cash flow for fiscal 2017 was exceptionally strong. It's sustainable, and it forms a basis for our consistent capital return program to shareholders. We remain structurally and strategically positioned to deliver meaningful earnings and margin expansions as we've articulated and focused on our 2020 model that we're going to discuss in more detail at our May 10 Investor and Analyst Day. So with that, I will conclude today's call. Thank you. Operator This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Your first question is from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you very much. Good afternoon. So, it looks like earnings have kind of flattened out here, and you talked about interest expense going up, the tax rate going up, at least in the short term, investments going up. How does this play into the 12% EPS growth that you're looking for over a number of years? Is that still the goal? And is that going to tend to be a little more backend loaded now? Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. Hi, Steve. This is Chris. And we have a great opportunity in 10 days to even unpack this further with you at our Investor Day. But now  but you'll see, and I don't want to jump what we're going to talk about in another 10 days, but our long-term model remains intact. Some of those points that you just highlighted, we'd highlighted were implicit in that range when we talked about it last year in the 2020 Vision. What you also heard today was the company making conscious decisions to make investments and accelerate investments across some of our new business models and initiatives that are taking shape earlier in this year. So, we're going to spend some time with you in another 10 days, you and our investors, to take you through that long-term vision that remains intact and also gives us the confidence to start putting forth some of these investments into the current periods here. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Can you be more explicit on the investments that you're making this coming year? What's the incremental investment? And where is it showing up? Is it gross margin? SG&A? What's your CapEx plan and so forth? Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. Certainly. The investments that I was alluding to there were more centered around the P&L. Okay? And if you look at how we've guided the first quarter here, you're seeing those investments show up in terms of both in gross profit as well as in SG&A. So, I talked about the incremental levels of investment around our research and development, design and engineering, expanding the innovation centers. That's going to be reflective in an SG&A as well as, as you see us bringing on some new acquisitions, I had also highlighted those are going to have incremental SG&A contributions. So at the front end of this year, when you have those investments coming in and you do not have any top-line growth, you're going to see more of a margin type of an impact. Mike also alluded to and talked through the investment levels that we're driving in terms of Nike. What you're seeing there is more operational that are going to be more reflective in our gross margin and gross profit implications. So those two alone  those activities right there equate to what you see when you put a guide out that we have that centered around $0.26 at the midpoint. So if you look, we're down sequentially roughly $20 million and all of that will be identified through these incremental investments and the shifts that we're seeing here. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Great. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Good afternoon, guys. I guess a couple questions from me. First of all, Nike. It sounds like you're accelerating the investments right now and I think Nike's CEO talked on their call about seeing tens of millions of dollars of gross margin benefit from partners like Flex, and that number should go up. So I'm curious, is the revenue trajectory and your expectations on revenues starting to inflect? Is that happening a little bit earlier with Nike? Could you just maybe update us on that dynamic? Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yeah, let me just talk a little bit about Nike more broadly. I think what some of the comments you're getting out of Nike  and we obviously see the same thing because we work hand in hand with them all the way from a design center, all the way to the factory floor, is that we're seeing the potential and the possibilities in front of us that are pretty significant. And we believe this whole concept of reinventing how shoes are manufactured is really alive and well. We're starting to get early successes around some of the design engagements that we're having about reinventing how design actually occurs, some of the new technologies of the shoes, and even into the automation projects that we're seeing. So what's happening is it's our objective and their objective, of course, is to try to accelerate these coming and take advantage of these benefits. So, the short-term impact of that is going to be higher operating expenses. If I think about what we're trying to do more specifically on the factory floor, we have all different models  a number of different models that we have to introduce into the floor. We have new technologies. We have automation. We have to re-optimize the supply chain for the new locations. We're taking and making improvements all the way back to the  or changes back to the design process, all the way back into Nike. And at the same time, hiring 12,000 people is the goal over a 15-month period. So, you can imagine doing all these kind of things at once and kind of reinventing how shoe manufacturing occurs at the same time. So, it's kind of a long answer, but the short of it is, all this is creating some pressure on the gross margin level. We're creating pressure on the gross margin level because we actually see the possibilities. And the amount of TAM that's available to Flex and the amount of opportunity for us to really help Nike is going to be pretty extraordinary, because $1 billion is just a small percentage of what they actually produce. And the one last thing I would finish with is we continue to be hopeful that despite the incremental operating investments that we'll do over the next couple of quarters, that by the time we get into Q4, we'll cross over into profits. And then it is  hopefully the learning is behind us. And ideally, as we move into FY 2019 and 2020 and 2021, it's really just about revenue expansion or supply expansion in number of shoes we built, and the learning curve is predominantly over. So hopefully, I answered your question. I know it was probably more than you were looking for, but that kind of outlines what we're trying to accomplish with Nike and what we think the possibilities are. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC No, more is always better, so appreciate that. Just if I think about the expense and the investments you guys are doing though right now, and of course, it seems like maybe it's a 30 basis point, 40 basis point margin impact in the June quarter guide. How long do you think that sustains? And does that sustain essentially all the way through March of 2017? Or do we start to see the revenue and leverage come in a bit quicker broadly in the model? Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. I think there's two parts to that. I think there's both the Nike and then the other investments. What we see is we see on the Nike side that sustaining for a couple of quarters, and we go back to the statement Mike just made in his prepared as well as how he closed, we have ourselves crossing over into profits in the last quarter of this next fiscal year, fiscal 2018. So that's the change on that piece. We anticipate seeing a much stronger second half for Flex this coming year. And with that incremental level of revenues, you're going see the leverage on the other investments that we're making inside of the R&D and other efforts that are putting some pressure on this near term. So the second half of the year for us is going to be much stronger. It's going to show the leverage. It's going to help us drive the profitability back up. And you also have a Nike shifting back into crossing into profits at the end of the next year. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. And I'll just give you a little more color in terms of some of the investments that we're really excited about, but I think about YTWO, I think the adoption that we're having and the conversation we're having in the marketplace is way above expectations. We already talked about Nike, so I don't need to talk about the excitement we have there about trying to accelerate what we can do there. We mentioned the IEI wins that are going to take a little bit of investment as we go into there, but they had record  they've had a number of different record bookings over the last few quarters, which is going to drive a lot of  which is going to secure their long-term revenue targets. We talked about AGM that we just brought on. We have to convert computer systems and absorb that. That'll take about two quarters. And quite frankly, on the Bose program, we probably have another quarter, quarter and a half of investment to get that whole business into our system. So while all these things are hitting kind of a lot more aggressively in the first and second quarter, a lot of them are on the back of just the success that we're having in terms of what we're seeing in the marketplace. So we're pretty excited to have them. We made a conscious decision to allow those investments to run and will actually play into second half with a much stronger revenue and with a revenue that's going to accelerate into FY 2019. So, that's kind of the play that we're running right now and we're pretty pleased with it. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Perfect. Thanks a lot and see you guys at the Analyst Day. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Thank you. Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks and good afternoon. Chris, you talked about a $20 million sequential increase related to the investments. Can you just give us a sense of the total investment, how much is Nike versus other, and what the leverage is dependent upon? Meaning, are there guaranteed volumes associated with this? Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. Certainly, Adam. And the $20 million was just a reference to equate to the Q4 operating profit and then a midpoint of guidance. So I wasn't being explicit as to the amount of those investments. But specifically, we're not quantifying with our partner, Nike, around what that level of investment is right now. We're just talking about the accelerated level that's going to be reflected in our performance. The relationship with Nike, as Mike says, continue to be strong. It's probably deeper than it was at any other stage right now. We're completely aligned with the production curve and we're continuing to manage that relationship as we go forward. I don't know what more I'm going to add with regard to that except that the investments have been a conscious level decision by the company that's necessary for us to move to accelerate the business model that we're getting after. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. And operating profit dollars, looks like they're going to decline year-over-year based on your guidance. How temporary is this? And I know your target is a CAGR, but do you think you can grow operating profit dollars over 10% in fiscal 2018? Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. We're going to have an ability to go more deeper on our long-term model in another 10 days. Our progress  what you will hear from us is that we're not moving off of our 2020 Vision, and we're going to unpack for you all the different areas that provide us that confidence as to how we move that 2020 Vision. That journey to 2020 is not going to be linear. You're seeing that evidence right now. Each quarter it will change with regards to the level of investments required from the company to post up, and secure, and capture those future profitable business streams. So, I'm not going to give you a 2018 view. I would tell you that it will not be at a 10% growth. We're going to be able to show you in another 10 days different elements of what stands behind the growth across each of the businesses and in total as we make the journey towards 2020. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the questions. So, the first question is a follow-up question around the elevated expenses. Should we think about the magnitude of the incremental expenses being larger in the September quarter as maybe the size of some of these pull-in programs starts to increase in scale? And then maybe you can just  I just want to be a bit more clear on how exactly those expenses go away as you move through the year. It sounds like maybe the revenue just comes in to get leverage on those expenses, or is  that's probably the primary reason that the impact goes away later this calendar year? Or are there some one-off, either SG&A or product development type expenses, that are truly  they just go away on an absolute basis as you move through the year? Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. Certainly, Mark. Let me try to  I think I got everything that you just asked. So, yeah, if I was to think about as you move forward, you should see a September quarter that'd be very similar in terms of that level of investment. There's nothing that's going to be accelerating. I think it's going to be very similar. And what you have when I describe the investments we're taking right now in terms of the design engineering, the expansion of innovation centers and that installed capacity, capability and competency, that's essentially coming in fixed. So as you think about those being put in place, you see a back half of the year that's much stronger in terms of the revenue and the volumes, and you're going to see that leverage play through. So you're going to see a leverage model that starts helping to drive the margin and profit dollars improving as you go through the year. And then, specifically, if you tie back to the Nike discussion that we've been having, Nike is going to be one in which we also start having greater revenues, greater execution. And so, as that changes in the back end of the year and we start moving out to come out of the back end of that year with profitability on that, that's also going to provide further leverage, further earnings upside, if you will. So, I think the way you describe it is exactly how we envision it. We're going to spend a little more time with you and others in another 10 days to get deeper on some of those attributes, but these are conscious decisions where we sit today to invest into the business with a long-term focus around discrete areas that are going to be revenue generative and truly operational profit generative. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yeah. That's helpful, Chris. Just a quick follow-up on that point and then I just have a second question. The quick follow-up is just the return on invested capital I think running around 20% for the company. These incremental investments that you're making, are they consistent with that sort of return profile going forward? And then my other question was on the high reliability business seeing nice year-over-year growth. Obviously, that's where your auto business is. A few semi companies have talked about seeing some deceleration in auto and I think North America is seeing some slowdown in SAAR. I understand Flex has been gaining content and expanding internationally, but is there anything you're factoring into your guidance on the auto side to maybe account for any unit SAAR type of slowdown if in fact that is occurring? Thank you. Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. Certainly, Mark. Yeah, and thank you for the first point on the investment level, because someone asked that earlier, and it is two parts. I've been talking a lot about the investment we're doing in terms of the P&L. There's also CapEx. As we think about CapEx for this coming year, it's going to be very similar to what we just printed this past year and before. I think there's nothing more elevated in terms of that capital investment being required by the company as we continue to invest in the platform and continue to invest in capability and capacity around the growing areas of the business. So that would be in check. What you do see is with a slightly lower profitability, you'll put a little pressure on the return profile, which puts a little pressure on the ROIC. I think you'll see us relatively consistent around the ROIC. It will have a little pressure at the front end, but it should be coming back up and sustain itself well in the range around the 20% and well above our weighted average cost of capital. So as I try to answer your second question, and that was related to how we think about auto, we couldn't be more pleased with the position we have inside of auto. And I think we've talked before with regards to what we've been seeing. These SAAR is something that we're very aware of and the production associated with those volumes. But for our offering, it's been more around the complete expansion of the services and capabilities that we have. Our auto content continues to grow very healthily. If you look back, you had 2008 where we were roughly around $25 per content in a car, this year we're coming out roughly around $118 of content in a car. So some real solid, double-digit growth, and we're seeing that go forward. You heard our announcement about AGM. AGM, we're super-excited about that strategic acquisition. It again provides us more capability inside of interior lighting and overhead consoles, and it just is another tool in which we can take what is a truly global platform that we're operating today with great meaningful partnerships and over 300 global platforms and continue to increase that. So we're getting growth in many different ways. Our guidance reflects not just some benefit from AGM, but also continue growth inside of auto that was very strong this past year. So, I think that's kind of  I'm trying to give you as much color as I can as to how I thought through that. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yeah. And pretty much, Mark... Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. ...year-after-year, we've beat our growth rate as we overachieved the SAAR levels. And while we'd like to have them be higher, they're not a requirement in order for us to hit the growth targets, unless they fall off like meaningfully. But so far they're pretty flat. The expectation is for them to be pretty flat. And we run reasonably independently, because we've been achieving double-digit growth rates for many, many years now. And as we look forward and we look at our book of business, we actually think going forward we will continue to have some double-digit growth near term. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Welcome. Operator The next question is from Jim Suva from Citi. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks very much. A quick clarification question, then I'll ask my main question. First, the clarification question. Does your guidance include the AGM Automotive acquisition? And if so, how should we think about that as far as magnitude? Just trying to figure out organic versus inorganic growth. And then my main question is on the CEC guidance, many of us on this call also cover many of those customers, and none of them are seeing such a big decline year-over-year. So, can you help us understand, are you transitioning off some programs or are some programs winding down? Are you walking away from some business? Could you lose some, because that CEC decline is quite material year-over-year? Thank you. Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. Thank you, Jim. Let me just start with the AGM. So the AGM is included in our current guidance. And it is a component  and I believe I answered this earlier, it is a component of the growth inside of HRS that we've identified for this next period, which is up 5% to 10% year-over-year. We're also seeing growth inside of our core automotive offering, and some modest growth inside of HRS. So it is part and parcel to the entire guidance framework there. I think we talked about AGM in our announcement when we talked about closing that. And what you still need to think about AGM for us is it's going to be accretive to earnings this year. It's going to be accretive to cash flow this year. Obviously, it's not a material transaction. It's a nice strategic transaction that is providing us some real complementary lighting and overhead console business. It's allowing us to really capture some more market share. It really does a nice job of balancing out North America and our Europe lighting offering. It accelerates some positions with some really strategic OEMs. It also just was announced that in 2016 it won the GM Innovation Award. So, there's all these other features that get us excited about what AGM does to the portfolio. But how you should think about it, it's completely inclusive. I would say that it's a big component of the HRS guide, but we're also growing inside of the core automotive and medical. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yeah. And just to address your CEC question, Jim, I think the best way to look at it is on an annual basis our CEC business was down about 5%. I expect that's probably not too far off of your benchmarks of how hardware's trending in with the other  with the OEMs. More specifically, on the quarter, the quarter's actually flat sequentially if you look at it on a sequential basis. And on the quarterly basis on the Q1 FY 2018, the Q1 2017 is a pretty tough comp. But I think the important part to think about as well on this is there's just more and more commoditization in the space, and as there moves to be more and more commoditization and revenue is hard to come, there's a lot of capacity out there and there's a lot of companies that have capacity that can build products like this. And what that does is it push margins down. And as you push margins down this space, it comes with inventory turns that run probably closer in the floor range. So, you actually  as the margins come down and returns are pressured as a result of plenty of capacity and movement to more and more commoditization structurally, it's going to be more and more challenging for us to invest in those kind of programs as opposed to focusing our investments where we have like a lot of different opportunities. And I think a lot  so a lot of that is just structural and I think you'll probably see more of it over time. The one thing that's unique to that is the CIC  or the CI3, where we continue to invest in, which is our cloud initiative. We continue to have double-digit growth and we expect a pretty strong growth rates over this next year. So, we're trying to reestablish our system to be very, very focused on where the OEMs need the future to be as opposed to chasing kind of a lower margin commoditized play with kind of rough inventory turns of kind of the past. So anyways, I think there's a lot of different pieces of that that you have to consider, but this is how we think about the business structurally going forward. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you for the details. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. You're welcome. Operator Your next question is from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ruplu Bhattacharya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Mike, can you just talk a little bit more about the IEI segment? Margins were back in the 4% to 6% range and I guess revenues were up mid-single digits for the year. You talked about some program wins. So how should we think about revenues? Can they accelerate in fiscal 2018 and can you get to the midpoint of the 4% to 6% range exiting the year? Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yeah. So, the first thing I'd say is I'd wait for more color on that as we get into the Analyst Day. But if you step back and just think about the IEI performance, it has continuous margin improvement. In FY 2015 for the year, we did 3% operating profit. In FY 2016, we did 3.4%. In FY 2017, we just finished with 3.6%, and that was like pretty tough with SunEdison being such a substantial portion of that, we lost all that margin contribution there. Closed the year at 4.1%, so we're obviously moving in a very, very positive direction. If you couple that with the fact that we're having, over the last few quarters, just record bookings, and if you'll note I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we actually believe these bookings will set us up to hit the long-term growth rates in IEI which, as you know, are 10%. So I think we continue to make very nice progress, and we're very, very bullish about the future and even immediately in FY 2018. But I would just ask you to wait for a little bit more detail as we'll be together again in 10 days and we'll be outlining our more long-term vision for this segment then. Ruplu Bhattacharya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up. You talked about CTG being a little bit better. This quarter it came in down 17% versus your guidance of down 20% to 30%. So just wondering, was there any particular area of strength? And also in that segment, did you, Mike, say that you need another quarter or maybe quarter and a half of investments in Bose? I would have thought Bose would be profitable by now, but maybe there's more investments there. So if you can just clarify that. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yeah. No, I think when you think about Bose  so CTG is kind of a mix of business. There's some seasonal implications and I think we're going to see a lot less seasonality going forward based on the mix they have. On the Bose business, they're definitely profitable. It's just that we've not optimized the profitability yet because the integration of the computer systems and the optimization of the factory with Flex systems as such is really not yet complete. So it usually takes anywhere from two to four quarters to really ultimately achieve a full what I would almost call synergy associated with the Flex systems. So that would be one of the structural elements. When we talk about the investments in the next couple of quarters that are pressuring our operating margins that will be one of those investments that will go away by the time we get to the third quarter. And so, in time that will work its way out pretty positively. But we're already  it's already positively contributing. It's just not at the margin targets yet that we'd like to see. Ruplu Bhattacharya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. And I would just expand just a little bit on that just to say in the current quarter, we did have some benefits from some legacy programs that went end of life. So, that was a contributor favorably. But again, think about CTG, we're on a path to enabling commercialization of products in new industries, it's about a richer mix. So it's not always going to be about the revenue growth here. And the Bose comments that Mike just shared with you are not a departure at all. I mean, we've been talking a lot about Bose not being accretive to our margins in the first several quarters. So, we're very pleased with how we're moving along with that foundational element of our future and you're going to continue to see a growth profile inside of CTG. Ruplu Bhattacharya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Great. Thank you. Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. You're welcome. Operator The next question is from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC Thanks very much. Just two quick ones for me. First, I believe last year you had a concentration of capital spending around two served markets and I was just curious can you give us a sense for the focus on CapEx this year or maybe a rough level of it. And then secondly, like you mentioned the medical business has been a little bit depressed. So, I was curious if you have a sense for when that might turn and start seeing growth again? Thanks. Christopher E. Collier - Flex Ltd. So with regards to the capital, I had highlighted earlier that we're going to be able to provide a better detail here in another 10 days at the Investor Day as regarding our capital allocation and capital investment as we move forward through 2020. But as I alluded to earlier, you should be anticipating 2018 to be on a very similar level of investment as this past year. As you highlighted, we've been making some concentrated capacity and capability investments in some of our growth areas. HRS has been one of those areas for us. And as I think about what we've done, we've put nearly $350 million into CapEx over the last several years into that business to support its expansion, to support its capability. So, you're going to see a very similar dispersion of our capital investment this coming year and in another 10 days I'll be able to give you a little bit better insight into some of those both in 2018 and beyond. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yeah. And on the medical business, we're planning on doing a pretty good deep dive with you on the strategy for medical over the  and what our expectations are for the coming years. The medical hardware business itself actually does not have much of a growth rate. If you start to separate out all the acquisitions and the effects of those acquisitions, it's actually pretty flat. And if you  also believe it or not, the acquisitions themselves, which we tend to see a lot of them, have actually called out some of the programs they've already awarded. As our customers went, focused on the integration as opposed to focused on the optimization, which is where a company like Flex comes in. So, it slows things down a little bit and we're experiencing that. At the same time, we've done some pretty significant investments in digital health where we brought on a whole new division that is focused specifically on trying to drive digital health and leveraging some of the technologies we have much more broadly than just the medical piece, but also into the connected home and the wearables. And we're going to give you a number of different  we'll give you some updates on that as we go forward and we'll talk about some of the expansion of the new markets that we're having in medical. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC Great. Thank you very much. Kevin Kessel - Flex Ltd. Operator, we're coming up to the top of the hour here, and I know there are a lot of earnings so we have time for one final question at this time. Operator The last question is from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. So, a couple of questions. On the CEC business, understand the areas of weakness, but you did talk about, Mike, opportunities in the cloud infrastructure and cloud computing area. How big is that business now for you? And how is the opportunity in terms of it moving the needle, offsetting the weakness in some of the areas that you talked about? Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yeah. So, right now, it's over $1 billion. We've got probably 18 new logos in it. You've probably seen some of our participation in the Open Compute platform and a number of different industries where we've moved into even almost a leadership position in terms of thinking how some of the changes should unfold. So we'll see it grow. It's probably not big enough yet to offset any kind of structural declines in the more commoditized part of the business. But we're super-excited about it. And if I think about the future, it's not just in terms of what CI3 can do, but it's really important to think about the advent and when 5G comes along, and then the telco cloud, which is still a couple years out. But we're actually positioning some of our investments pretty heavily to take advantage of 5G and telco cloud and be in a leadership position in those places. So, it's not big enough to offset the structural declines and some of the possibilities for like 5G and telco cloud are out a couple of years. So, we're going to have investments over the next couple of years, I think, that are not necessarily going to offset the decline. But that's what we're trying to do and we'll see how it goes. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. And then just lastly, we've heard from several of your competitors and customers about memory shortages, SSD shortages impacting revenue opportunities. We're seeing inventory build at some competitors and even seeing lead-times strength  lengthen on other components. Are you seeing that at all? Your inventories look pretty clean, just trying to figure out what you're seeing in that area. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Yes. So we are seeing it. We are seeing lead times push out. A lot of it we've anticipated. We're having some impacts to revenue, but it's not material at this point. And we do know a lot of customers are giving us a really, really  are starting to build up inventory, and hopefully they won't create a shortage as a result of people hoarding inventory. But we are actually in pretty good balance and able to get most of the inventory, and not seeing any real impact to our revenue at this point. And the one thing I would add is we've done a tremendous amount of investment in our real-time systems about how we're able to look at the inventory and look at the visibility in the supply chain. We've done a lot of investments in something that we call Pulse, which is our own internal system to really get real-time visibility of inventory across the supply chain. We've been doing implementations like Elementum, which is obviously a leader in SaaS based visibility in the supply chain, where we're using them to help us manage our inventory and our visibility, and we've driven a lot of systems to be real time with our people. So, I think those kind of changes have made a huge impact on our visibility into the supply chain and our ability to manage inventory. And you actually see another impact of that where you actually see our work in process has actually come down quite a bit, and we've got some of the best inventory turns we've had in a while. So, we actually feel it, we see it. We don't feel it too bad, because I think we are a bit ahead of it. But again, without question, lead times are pushing out on a number of different products. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Thanks a lot. Michael M. McNamara - Flex Ltd. Let's close. I want to thank everybody for attending the call. Our Sketch-to-Scale strategy continues to show a lot of promise. There is plenty of evidence to support our sustained business evolution. This quarter, once again, was our 14th straight quarter of year-over-year adjusted operating margin growth. Our free cash flow for fiscal 2017 was exceptionally strong. It's sustainable, and it forms a basis for our consistent capital return program to shareholders. We remain structurally and strategically positioned to deliver meaningful earnings and margin expansions as we've articulated and focused on our 2020 model that we're going to discuss in more detail at our May 10 Investor and Analyst Day. So with that, I will conclude today's call. Thank you. Operator This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Kit Leong Low Good morning. Thank you, Jing, for the opening statement. Welcome to Focus Media Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Results Conference Call. In the fourth quarter of 2012, aggregate net revenue from LCD display network, in-store network, poster frame network and movie theater network, or otherwise we call these our core business, was $244.1 million. This is within the company guidance range of $237 million and $246 million. This represented a slight decrease of 1% from $247.7 million for the third quarter of 2012 and an increase of 2% from $238.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. Net revenue from the traditional outdoor billboard network, which is -- which we consider noncore as part of business line, for the fourth quarter 2012 was $6.1 million, within the company guidance of between $6 million and $7 million. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Focus Media for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $95.1 million, within the company guidance range of $93 million and $98 million, slightly increasing from $94.6 million for the third quarter 2012 and a slight decline of 1% from $96 million for the fourth quarter 2011. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Focus Media per fully diluted ADS was $0.71, substantially unchanged from $0.71 per fully diluted ADS for the third quarter of 2012 and an increase of 1% from $0.70 per fully diluted ADS for the fourth quarter of 2011. For the full year 2012, aggregate net revenue from LCD display network, in-store network, poster frame network and movie theater network was $895.5 million, representing an increase of 22% from $737 million for the full year of 2011. Net revenue from traditional outdoor billboard network for full year 2012 was $32 million, representing a decrease of 35% from $49.5 million for the full year 2011, mainly due to the company downsizing the noncore business. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Focus Media for the full year 2012 was $333.1 million, representing an increase of 17% from $284.1 million for the full year of 2011. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Focus Media per fully diluted ADS for full year 2012 was $2.50, a 22% increase from $2.05 per fully diluted ADS for the full year 2011. In terms of cash flow, net cash inflow from operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2012, after deducting the purchase of equipment and subsidiaries was $137.6 million, an increase of 22% from $112.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. Net cash inflow from operating activities for full year 2012 after deducting the purchase of equipment and subsidiaries was $335.7 million, representing an increase of 47% from $228 million for the full year of 2011. Last, for the going private transaction, I'd like to give you a quick update. The company announced today that it has called an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders to be held on April 29, 2013, to consider and vote on, among other things, the proposal to authorize and approve the previously announced agreement and plan of merger dated back on December 19, 2012. And thank you, and like to open up the call for questions right now. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Sachin Shah [ph] from Cap One [ph]. Unknown Analyst Just want to find out, so I saw the shareholder vote, the April 29, as you mentioned, I want to find out, is that approximately when you expect the deal to close shortly after the shareholder vote? Can you maybe just give us a background of -- or an update on when you ultimately expect the deal to close? Kit Leong Low [indiscernible] Subsequent to that, there will be a process of people calling -- the buyers group calling capital, as well as the closing mechanism by paying off to the paying agents. So probably, it will be approximately about 3 to 4 weeks after that, that you would probably see the cash from our paying agents, so that will be the process. The delisting process of the company takes a slightly different path. After the closing, i.e. the fact that we have -- the buyers group has paid the paying agent, subsequent to that, there will be a filing to NASDAQ for the process to be -- to fully delist the company subsequently. So that will be the process. So to put the answers in short, it will probably about 3 to 4 weeks after the April 29 date when the full closing would happen. Unknown Analyst Okay. And can you maybe just give us an update on the financing. There's been kind of stories out, detailing how finance [indiscernible] and some others still has [indiscernible] completed. So maybe you can just give us an update on the comfort level of arriving at the full financing for the transaction to head to the finish line. Kit Leong Low As the company, we can't speak on behalf of the buyers' group. I think all the detail finance -- in terms of financing information, is actually in the 13-E3 filing, which is quite clearly delineated. I think it's really clear that -- in the 13-E3 -- that the debt financing is underwritten by the bank. So it's not a function of whether the financing is done or not, it's basically the bank's space to underwritten the financings, it's not a fact that the buyers could be in the process of raising that as we speak right now. So I would encourage investors to take a look at the 13-E3 itself as part of financing. Unknown Analyst Okay. So the financing, yes, it is committed, so we just basically have to wait about approximately 3 weeks from the shareholder vote to close the transaction. We don't have to wait for the financing to be indicated per se. Is that correct? Kit Leong Low Right. The buyers' group has the time to call their capital. The time allowing to call the capital is roughly about 2 to 3 weeks, and that includes both the equity financing as well as the debt financing. Unknown Analyst Okay. And just one last question... Kit Leong Low Assuming that the vote -- sorry. Unknown Analyst Yes, just one last question. So shareholder vote, obviously they have to do whatever they have to administratively including calling that capital from the banks. Is there any other obstacles or anything that you can envision that would not allow this deal to close as it currently stands? Kit Leong Low Sure. I mean, the best I could answer you, is I think the risk factors are quite well delineated in 13-E3. I don't think there's anything else we like to add beyond that, so we can be exhaustive on the call on the different potential risk factors. I think it's pretty quite clearly written on the 13-E3 of any sort of major -- major sort of risk factors out there. Sorry for not being -- I just don't want to be -- and then be missing some of that. Operator Your next question today comes from the line of Jiong Shao from Macquarie. Jiong Shao - Macquarie Research My first question is on the overall ad environment, I was hoping you can elaborate a bit on what you are seeing -- what you saw last quarter and what you are seeing now and your outlook for this year. And I recall that in your 13-E3 document, you've provided an outlook for the full year, and in fact for the next few years as well. Anything you can add or elaborate on that -- those outlook, that will be great. That's my first question. Jiang Nanchun [Chinese] Unknown Executive [Chinese] Kit Leong Low [Chinese] Jiang Nanchun [Chinese] Kit Leong Low Shao Jiong, let me translate the portion that Jason answered and then I'll come back to you on your sort of subquestions. In terms of the ad environment, in the fourth quarter, because of the political tension between China and Japan, the auto sector was quite badly affected. A lot of the Japanese auto ended up not putting a whole lot of budget onto sort of what we call the medium- to high-end media companies. So for the most part, I think the fourth quarter is, to a large extent, affected by that, though we see some recovery to it at the end of December last year in terms of that segment. But as of right now, we still haven't seen it back to what we would consider to be normal, sort of normal in terms of the environment. In terms of the outlook for the current year, it's still -- to put it in short, it's still unclear as far as how it's going to pan out. As of the way that we look at it, currently, is that given the change in the government, in China for the most part, we believe that there will be a transition phase in terms of when a lot of the policy that's been talked about will start to take in -- take effect in the country. Until then the macroeconomy, I think for the most part, I think you probably read in a lot of different media reports as well as like your shops in terms of different [indiscernible] banks outlook, there's still some uncertainties as far as how the macroenvironment will pan out. And given advertising is highly correlated to the macro in terms of the economic environment, at the moment, it's difficult to tell exactly how it's going to pan out for 2013. We're keeping a close eye on it. I mean, the best I could -- we could try to -- help to -- and try to take a look at it is that, in terms of qualitatively, the environment in the first quarter as compared to fourth quarter, is about similar. If you really want to drill down to it may be slightly better, but not a whole lot better. So it's still somewhat tentative in terms of the outlook at the moment. To answer your second subpart of question in terms of the forecast we put into our -- into the 13-E3, there was a forecast we provided to buyers' group as well as JPMorgan at the time of when the transaction was being contemplated. So for the most part, that's the outlook that we hope the company will be able to achieve going forward, so that's sort of how we look at those numbers. These numbers are subject to change from time to time, it depends on how the year pans out. As you can appreciate, and just like any sort of a forecast, it takes a view on -- at the time on how we look at the business. So and as the macro environment changes, from time to time, those number may or may not be the same. So it depends on execution. But as of right now, in terms of the numbers that we look at there is what we hope to be able to achieve at the moment. Jiong Shao - Macquarie Research Okay, great. My second question is could you please provide us, as you usually did in the past, the vertical exposure to different sectors and how trends quarter-over-quarter was last quarter? Kit Leong Low Sure. In terms of the fourth quarter 2012, FMCG is 30% of the business, the subsegment between FMCG, what we call the 3 major subsegment, one is cosmetic and personal hygiene, that's roughly about 10%; food and pharma, that's roughly about 8%; beverage and wine is about 12%; transportation is roughly about 20%; auto is about -- [indiscernible] auto is about 18%; transportation services is about 4%, 3.5% to be exact; financial services, about 7%; Internet-related is about 10%; telco and IP products is about 12%; home electronics, about 1%; real estate, about 5%; and I think the rest of them are pretty fragmented, so I'll just stop there. Operator [Operator Instructions] There seems to be no further questions on the line today. I would now like to hand the call back to your presenters. Please continue. Jing Lu Thank you, everybody. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today. Thank you all for your participation.

So I would encourage investors to take a look at the 13-E3 itself as part of financing. Unknown Analyst Okay. So the financing, yes, it is committed, so we just basically have to wait about approximately 3 weeks from the shareholder vote to close the transaction. We don't have to wait for the financing to be indicated per se. Is that correct? Kit Leong Low Right. The buyers' group has the time to call their capital. The time allowing to call the capital is roughly about 2 to 3 weeks, and that includes both the equity financing as well as the debt financing. Unknown Analyst Okay. And just one last question... Kit Leong Low Assuming that the vote -- sorry. Unknown Analyst Yes, just one last question. So shareholder vote, obviously they have to do whatever they have to administratively including calling that capital from the banks. Is there any other obstacles or anything that you can envision that would not allow this deal to close as it currently stands? Kit Leong Low Sure. I mean, the best I could answer you, is I think the risk factors are quite well delineated in 13-E3. I don't think there's anything else we like to add beyond that, so we can be exhaustive on the call on the different potential risk factors. I think it's pretty quite clearly written on the 13-E3 of any sort of major -- major sort of risk factors out there. Sorry for not being -- I just don't want to be -- and then be missing some of that. Operator Your next question today comes from the line of Jiong Shao from Macquarie. Jiong Shao - Macquarie Research My first question is on the overall ad environment, I was hoping you can elaborate a bit on what you are seeing -- what you saw last quarter and what you are seeing now and your outlook for this year. And I recall that in your 13-E3 document, you've provided an outlook for the full year, and in fact for the next few years as well. Anything you can add or elaborate on that -- those outlook, that will be great. That's my first question. Jiang Nanchun [Chinese] Unknown Executive [Chinese] Kit Leong Low [Chinese] Jiang Nanchun [Chinese] Kit Leong Low Shao Jiong, let me translate the portion that Jason answered and then I'll come back to you on your sort of subquestions. In terms of the ad environment, in the fourth quarter, because of the political tension between China and Japan, the auto sector was quite badly affected. A lot of the Japanese auto ended up not putting a whole lot of budget onto sort of what we call the medium- to high-end media companies. So for the most part, I think the fourth quarter is, to a large extent, affected by that, though we see some recovery to it at the end of December last year in terms of that segment. But as of right now, we still haven't seen it back to what we would consider to be normal, sort of normal in terms of the environment. In terms of the outlook for the current year, it's still -- to put it in short, it's still unclear as far as how it's going to pan out. As of the way that we look at it, currently, is that given the change in the government, in China for the most part, we believe that there will be a transition phase in terms of when a lot of the policy that's been talked about will start to take in -- take effect in the country. Until then the macroeconomy, I think for the most part, I think you probably read in a lot of different media reports as well as like your shops in terms of different [indiscernible] banks outlook, there's still some uncertainties as far as how the macroenvironment will pan out. And given advertising is highly correlated to the macro in terms of the economic environment, at the moment, it's difficult to tell exactly how it's going to pan out for 2013. We're keeping a close eye on it. I mean, the best I could -- we could try to -- help to -- and try to take a look at it is that, in terms of qualitatively, the environment in the first quarter as compared to fourth quarter, is about similar. If you really want to drill down to it may be slightly better, but not a whole lot better. So it's still somewhat tentative in terms of the outlook at the moment. To answer your second subpart of question in terms of the forecast we put into our -- into the 13-E3, there was a forecast we provided to buyers' group as well as JPMorgan at the time of when the transaction was being contemplated. So for the most part, that's the outlook that we hope the company will be able to achieve going forward, so that's sort of how we look at those numbers. These numbers are subject to change from time to time, it depends on how the year pans out. As you can appreciate, and just like any sort of a forecast, it takes a view on -- at the time on how we look at the business. So and as the macro environment changes, from time to time, those number may or may not be the same. So it depends on execution. But as of right now, in terms of the numbers that we look at there is what we hope to be able to achieve at the moment. Jiong Shao - Macquarie Research Okay, great. My second question is could you please provide us, as you usually did in the past, the vertical exposure to different sectors and how trends quarter-over-quarter was last quarter? Kit Leong Low Sure. In terms of the fourth quarter 2012, FMCG is 30% of the business, the subsegment between FMCG, what we call the 3 major subsegment, one is cosmetic and personal hygiene, that's roughly about 10%; food and pharma, that's roughly about 8%; beverage and wine is about 12%; transportation is roughly about 20%; auto is about -- [indiscernible] auto is about 18%; transportation services is about 4%, 3.5% to be exact; financial services, about 7%; Internet-related is about 10%; telco and IP products is about 12%; home electronics, about 1%; real estate, about 5%; and I think the rest of them are pretty fragmented, so I'll just stop there. Operator [Operator Instructions] There seems to be no further questions on the line today. I would now like to hand the call back to your presenters. Please continue. Jing Lu Thank you, everybody. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today. Thank you all for your participation.

Now, I would like to turn the call over to the company's Chairman and CEO, Kosta Kartsotis. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with a few prepared remarks before turning the call over to Dennis Secor, our Chief Financial Officer. Following his prepared remarks, Greg McKelvey, our Chief Strategy and Digital Officer, will join us for the Q&A. Our results for the quarter, while largely in line with our expectations, continue to reflect a challenging retail environment and the watch category undergoing significant change. The strategies we are pursuing in the midst of these headwinds enable us to better compete in the environment and capitalize on the growing importance of technology to the watch category. The newness and the innovation that we are infusing into our fashion accessories is gaining traction with our retail partners and consumers alike, demonstrating that technology can be the catalyst needed to drive growth in watches. We are very excited about the next generation of products we are developing and launching throughout the year. Our design, technology and engineering expertise were on display at the important Basel Watch Fair, where we received a very positive response to our assortment and the improved functionality. We believe we are in a position to further expand our leadership position in the fashion accessory space, expand our addressable market and improve our financial performance. Our focus for the year continues to be on executing against our New World Fossil restructuring initiative, driving growth in our core watch business and advancing our wearable products within an expanded offering across additional brands. With wearables, we continue to re-imagine the watch and its capabilities. Innovation has always been at the heart of what we do, which is what makes this period of disruption in watches a very exciting time for our team. We are on track to launch over 300 SKUs this year with enhanced engineering that will enable slimmer cases, more functionality and brighter screens. We are excited to bring five more brands on to our wearables platform, including DKNY, and Marc Jacobs, MICHELE, Relic and Tory Burch, to the nine other brands we introduced in 2016. Our new products for this year will include slimmer and smaller hybrid smartwatches and full round touchscreen smartwatches with custom displays and branded micro apps to create a portfolio of fashion-first technology accessories. Within hybrid smartwatches, we will introduce new design variations that include increased functional side pushers, allowing for various customizable tasks and notifications. All of the 14 brands from our portfolio of wearables will benefit from this enhanced functionality. Hybrid smartwatches represent an opportunity to reach a new generation of watches wearers, and we believe we are uniquely positioned to revolutionize the watch space with these accessories given our depth of brand offerings. Our 2017 touchscreen smartwatches will see improvements in every way, from better screen resolution to smaller cases sizes and branded micro apps, enabled by the launch of Android Wear 2.0. Our internal software development team has created apps to offer unique functionalities that align with the look and feel of each brand, a capability made possible through the acquisition of Misfit and the development of our engineering team. In addition to updated Fossil and Michael Kors' touchscreen watches, we'll expand the offering to Emporio Armani, Diesel and Misfit, which we'll all launch this fall. With the Misfit Vapor, we'll introduce new features such as optical heart rate monitoring and swim-proof functionality, our first product to offer those features. We continue to broaden our distribution and consumer electronics channels with our new wearables products enabling us to work with new wholesale partners. Based on the success across the smaller set of stores and the channel during the fourth quarter, we're working to significantly expand the number of doors we distribute to in the CE channel. We're moving quickly and reacting to what the consumer is telling us about the new wearable product. Along those lines, we have simplified the pricing for the Fossil Q assortment offering two price points in hybrids and two price points in display, providing an even more competitive and compelling offer for the consumer. Driving volume and leveraging the scale we bring to the category is enabling us to improve our product costs, a goal we communicated coming into the year. We are very encouraged by the team's ability to deliver some of these benefits earlier than we originally expected and will continue to drive further progress to provide the right long-term product margins for the category. As we shared with you in February, with the addition of technology and new functionality in our watches, we are expanding our addressable market beyond the single category traditional watch space we once competed in. We are now poised to take advantage of the growth in the wearables space, while continuing to leverage our competitive strengths in the traditional watch business in order to increase our share in the combined market. At the New World Fossil, we continue to execute against this initiative as we create a leaner and more nimble operating platform, capable of better serving our customer and competing in this new retail environment. During the first quarter, we took expense reduction actions that will better position the organization to support our growth-driving initiatives, while focusing fewer resources on areas of the business that are not as high a priority currently. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach to managing capital required to navigate New World Fossil. This is a very broad initiative, which demands that we strategically prioritize actions that generate the best returns on our capital investments, actions designed to enhance our organizational structure, as well as our supply chain, an area that can further drive gross margin and profitability improvements over time. As we continue to advance our comprehensive plan to evolve our business model for the future, we are very pleased with the progress the team has made. With what we have accomplished so far, we are on target to deliver about 40% of New World Fossil's profit enhancement goal this year and the initiatives we're driving today should position us to deliver even more against our overall $200 million goal. We're very encouraged by the speed with which the organization is adapting to these changes and the commitment shown across the organization to be more disciplined in the way we operate and delivering the expected benefits from this process. Another area of our business we continue to focus on is driving growth in our own brands. This will continue to be a focus for us as we work to further grow Fossil and Skagen and look for other initiatives that can drive our own revenues. First quarter results for both brands reflect a softer wholesale environment and weaker traffic in the retail space. However, Skagen was able to deliver a flat performance in the quarter and Fossil declined 10%, both in constant currency. Fossil declined largely driven by a weaker performance in leathers, a category we are working hard to improve with upcoming design improvements. Our wearables product continues to perform well and we have initiatives in the pipeline to further grow that portion of the business, in addition to the pricing changes I mentioned earlier. In traditional watches, we are continuing to innovate and have identified several trends that we are distorting. You will also see Fossil launching a new media campaign with an emphasis on social, digital and print marketing utilizing authentic brand ambassadors. These ambassadors were strategically chosen to introduce the Fossil Q product to a wide range of ages and prospective watch wearers, while staying true to the brand heritage. In closing, our entire team is very energized by the challenge in front of us and focused on growing our core watch business through innovation and leveraging our core competitive strengths. All of our strategic advantages continue to make us the leader in our space and differentiate us from many of our competitors, as we actively seek to add new brands to further enhance our portfolio. With technology and innovation, we have strengthened our position, and we believe we are on the right track to improve our financial performance, see significant growth in our wearables business this year, as the products grow to represent a much larger percent of our business. And we remain confident in our strategic priorities and the initiatives we are pursuing given their ability to positively impact our results and drive long-term shareholder value. We will continue to expand our addressable market with successful wearable product launches that leverage our proven design and branding expertise, further establishing our leadership position in the fashion accessories space. And now I would like to turn the call over to Dennis for additional color on our financial performance. As you'll hear, we are adjusting our outlook for the year, primarily given further pressure on gross margin due to promotional activity in our outlet channel. The retail landscape is very challenging right now. While we are very focused on our long-term strategies and the opportunities they represent, we are mindful of the need to balance those with the near-term challenges in the business. We are focused on this and have not lost sight of the importance of striking that balance. Dennis? Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Thanks, Kosta, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results were largely in-line with our expectations as constant currency net sales decreased 11% and on a reported basis decreased to $582 million. During the quarter, we continued to advance our strategy in wearables driving significant growth in the category, particularly smartwatches, which helped to mitigate the decline in traditional watches. That decline, combined with the continued softness in leathers, resulted in sales at the lower end of our expectations. For the quarter, we delivered results within our range of expectations and reported a net loss per share of $1, including restructuring charges of $0.35 per share compared to earnings of $0.12 last year. The decline compared to last year was primarily driven by lower sales and gross margins and restructuring charges, mitigated partially by lower operating expenses. First quarter loss per share was positively impacted by $0.11 due to changes in foreign currency with a strong U.S. dollar negatively impacting our sales and operating margins, however, operating gains from hedging activity more than offset that negative impact. On a year-over-year comparison, the impact from currency was essentially neutral given last year's $0.10 positive impact from non-operating contract gains. To recap the quarter's sales performance; as we expected, we had a tough comparison in the first quarter given Q1 of 2016 saw greater sell-in across our brands and channels. In addition, the consolidation of our retail store fleet also contributed to our sales decline as we operated with roughly 40 fewer stores compared to last year's first quarter. Wearables represented 7% of our sales across product categories and over 75% of those sales came from smartwatches, significantly impacting the trend in the watch category for our key brands. For Michael Kors, while watch sales did decline in the quarter, once again smartwatches positively impacted overall watch trends for the brand by double-digit. Fossil declined 10% in constant dollars compared to last year, mainly driven by leathers. Despite a low single-digit decline in watches, smartwatches had a significantly positive impact on the watch category for the brand, nearly offsetting the entire decline in traditional watches. Skagen sales were flat compared to last year with all categories performing similarly. In the retail channel, comp store sales, including e-comm sales, which grew 20% for the quarter, declined 11% due to further deceleration in traffic trends in our retail stores. Now from a regional perspective; in the Americas, first quarter sales decreased 17% to $278 million with traditional watches and leathers driving the decline. Declines across all the brands in the portfolio were driven by decreases in traditional watches, primarily offset by connected watches with our strongest performance coming from Michael Kors Access. Both wholesale and retail sales declined at similar rates in the quarter. In Europe, reported sales decreased 7% to $196 million, a 3% constant dollar decrease. Our relatively flat performance in jewelry and watches with declines in traditional watches offset by connected watches was offset by a decline in leathers. Within the region, continued growth in Skagen and increases in Armani Exchange and Michael Kors were offset by declines in the other brands in the portfolio. Modest growth in Spain was offset by declines in the UK and Middle East with both the wholesale and retail channels decreasing across the region. In Asia, sales decreased 5% to $109 million with declines in watches led by traditional watches and leathers driving the decrease. Growth in India and China was offset by a decline in Japan and Australia. In the quarter, gross profit decreased to $290 million and gross margin declined 300 basis points to 49.8%. Lower margin in the retail channel, primarily due to increased promotions to drive sales in our outlets and online, as well as a higher mix of connected products, which currently deliver lower margins were the biggest drivers of the decline. The negative impact of changes in foreign currencies and an increase in the relative mix of off price sales, which were flat to last year, also contributed to the decline. International mix partially offset those headwinds did as the initial benefits we are seeing from our New World Fossil initiatives and we expect those improvements to expand as we move throughout the year. First quarter operating expenses were $335 million or 57.5% of sales and included $26 million of restructuring costs associated with realigning and optimizing our organizational structure plus store closure cost, primarily in the Americas. Excluding those items, expenses were significantly lower compared to the first quarter of last year as we begin to realize the initial benefits of New World Fossil. Marketing expenses were also lower than a year ago, as we shifted marketing investments to the second and third quarters to better create awareness and support our significant wearables rollout this year. Our first quarter operating loss was $45 million, driven by lower sales in gross margins. Expenses were flat as reductions in our ongoing operating expenses offset the $26 million impact of restructuring charges. First quarter other income increased roughly $3 million to 6 million, due to more favorable foreign currency activity. Interest expense increased roughly $2 million, due to higher interest rates. Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was roughly 3% compared to last year's 31%, due to changes in tax accounting rules and jurisdictional earnings. While we had anticipated a small tax charge in the quarter, we ultimately recorded a small benefit, primarily due to our updated estimate for restructuring charges this year, which I will address shortly. Now, turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $51 million, invested $4 million in CapEx and reduced borrowings by $16 million. We improved our net debt position by roughly $221 million compared to a year ago. We ended the quarter with roughly $321 million in cash compared to $307 million last year and debt of $616 million compared to $823 million a year ago. Inventory levels at the end of the first quarter were down 9% with traditional watch inventories down substantially, enabling us to both invest in wearables inventories to drive growth, while also reducing our overall investment in inventory. Accounts receivable increased by 4% to roughly $245 million and wholesale DSOs increased by 7 days compared to the prior year, due to timing and shifts in customer mix. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $21 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we amended and extended our credit agreement with our banks. This amendment extends the facility until May 2019 and among other things, provides us with greater covenant flexibility during our peak working capital periods. The amendment also included a higher fee structure, which we had already anticipated. We're pleased to have the support of our banking partners as we work through the transformation of our business and navigate a challenging retail environment. Let's now move to our outlook. With the first quarter now behind us, we're updating our outlook for the year to reflect our experience and learning from the first quarter. Let me start with our operational results and then later give an update on our New World Fossil restructuring investments. So on operations let me start with our traditional business. In our traditional business, while sales continued to decline, first quarter sales were modestly stronger than we had planned going into the quarter. We are experiencing an intensifying competitive environment, mainly in our outlets and international concessions, necessitating a greater use of promotions to drive sales in our stores as we compete for consumer spending. This put more pressure on gross margins, particularly in the second half of the quarter. We were able to mitigate some of that pressure though by further containing expenses, but not enough to fully mitigate the margin headwind. We expect this promotional trend to carry throughout the balance of the year, which is reflected in our updated guidance. Next, in wearables, while we increased sales by nearly 400% compared to last year, our selling plans were short of our initial plans for the quarter. In the quarter, we also continued working with our licensed partners and now have better visibility into our distribution plans for 2017. With our ambitious plans, we don't expect we will get all the distribution we had initially anticipated in place this year, though with the expansion of wearables across a larger portion of our brand portfolio, we continue to expect that we could roughly triple our penetration of wearables revenues, which represented roughly 5% of last year sales. From an earnings perspective, while we're adjusting the upper end of our sales expectations to reflect our updated distribution plans, we don't expect a significant impact to earnings. Based on the greater visibility we now have into our wearable supply chain and product costing, and our first quarter wearables margins, we expect that our wearables margins will be stronger than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. Based on these factors, we are updating our annual sales expectations in the range between down 1.5% and 6%, both of which include roughly a 1.5 point currency headwind. We expect our sales growth rates to improve sequentially throughout the year, as we rollout more brands on to our wearables platform progressively throughout the year. Next to gross margins; we continue to plan that overall gross margins will be down compared to last year, given currency headwinds and the impact of wearables margins on our mix. We are updating our expectations to reflect further headwinds due to the promotional retail environment mainly for traditional watches. Given our better-than-planned wearables cost, we do expect that the mix impact from wearables will not be as severe as we had initially expected. Moving to expenses; coming out of our first quarter, our team has identified further areas where we can reduce operating costs, gaining greater efficiencies in our operational processes, including accelerating some of our New World Fossil cost benefits into 2017. Our goal is to use these further cost reductions to mitigate anticipated gross margin pressures for the remainder of the year, though we do not expect that we will be able to fully offset these further margin headwinds this year. For the full year, excluding restructuring charges, we continue to expect to operate with substantially lower expenses throughout the year. After restructuring charges, we've updated our plans for the year to focus 2017 investments on activities that deliver near-term cash payback. As a result, we're now planning to defer some of our planned store closures and now expect total 2017 restructuring charges of roughly $45 million, $12 million of which we expect to incur in the second quarter. Overall for the year, we expect total expenses to be lower than last year and we expect to operate with the total expense rate that is flat to down compared to last year. We now expect to operate with an operating margin between 1.5% and 2.2%, which includes roughly a 90 basis point headwind related to currencies. We now expect full-year earnings per share in the range between a loss of $0.40 per share and earnings of $0.30 per share. These updated expectations include a $0.60 restructuring charge, which is $0.41 lower than our previous expectations. Given our adjustment and expected restructuring charges and variability and jurisdictional mix, our guidance now assumes a tax rate in the low 20% range at the lower end and the low 30% range at the upper end and we have adjusted our guidance to reflect this change. We continue to assume higher interest expense this year compared to a year ago, given our financing activities. And assuming exchange rates remain at prevailing levels, based on our other expectations, we'd expect non-operating currency net benefits roughly similar to last year's levels. Based on our current estimates, as we move into the back half of the year, we expect our earnings to sequentially improve. We continue to expect gross margin pressures to be strongest in the third quarter, given the greatest year-over-year change in connected mix relative to last year. We continue to expect that our planned shift of greater advertising investments into the third quarter will likely dampen the earnings benefit of our anticipated wearables growth. And we also continue to expect that expense timing to turn in the fourth quarter when we expect to generate a substantial majority of this year's earnings. For the second quarter, we expect sales to decline in the range between 8% and 11.5%, which includes roughly a 220 basis point currency headwind. We expect operating margin in the range between negative 3.5% to negative 5.5% and a loss per share in the range between $1 and $0.83, which includes a restructuring charge of $0.15 per share. Let me take a moment to talk about liquidity and cash flow. With the amendments we made to our credit facility, we have additional flexibility to operate during our peak working capital periods. Our recent declines in EBITDA are putting additional pressure on our available capital. However, with our new facility now in place, we expect that it, coupled with our cash generation, will provide us with sufficient resources to manage throughout the year and over the life of the facility. As a management team, we are highly focused on managing our capital carefully and prudently and are working to improve our position. We are now refocusing both our CapEx and our restructuring investments on those initiatives that drive near-term cash returns. We have opportunities to monetize a modest level of international unencumbered assets. We're continuing to drive our investments in inventory down ending Q1 with nearly $60 million less inventory than we had a year ago, and we are focused on other areas to optimize our investment in working capital. Our goal for the year is to generate overall free cash flow similar to last year's $144 million. There are headwinds against that goal. The biggest of which are lower operating earnings and higher interest rates. At our higher level of expectations, those represent roughly an $85 million headwind, including our restructuring investments and the effects of currencies. We have significant offsets to those headwinds. Based on our updated plans, we'll deploy $30 million less CapEx than last year. Given this year's lower earnings, we expect we'll pay roughly $20 million less in taxes this year. And our goal is to leverage our efforts to manage working capital in inventory and in other areas to bridge the gap. We expect that our cash build this year will primarily be in international markets. While it remains our goal to reduce our debt position that will be challenging this year given that the majority of our restructuring investments will require U.S. cash, limiting our ability to repay our debt, which is U.S. based. Therefore, we continue to expect to end the year with a relatively similar debt position as last year. Our ability to generate cash flow remains strong even in a disruptive environment. Our net debt position, currently roughly $300 million, improved $180 million in fiscal 2016, and we expect it to substantially improve again this year. Our capital challenges are twofold. First, the majority of our cash flow was generated overseas, which creates a substantial tax consequence to fully use that cash to repay existing U.S. debt. Secondly, given that our debt is concentrated with banks; our availability is a significant function of our historical EBITDA, which has been recently declining, including a significant impact from currencies. We remain focused on solutions to mitigate these issues, including diversifying our capital structure, both in terms of markets and tenor. And with that, we'll open up the call to your questions. Please limit yourself to one single-part question, so that we can get to everyone and give them a chance to ask a question. If you have further questions, please re-queue and we'll get to as many questions as time permits. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Our first question is from Ed Yruma of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Edward J. Yruma - Pacific Crest Securities Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I know you indicated that sell-in on wearables was a little bit short of plans, I guess any specificity there would be helpful. I know you gave some color around the Fossil lift for wearables, but how did the Michael Kors wearable performance shake out? And was some of the weaker sell-in due to the potential for orders that maybe got pushed out toward the back end of the year? Thank you. Gregory A. McKelvey - Fossil Group, Inc. Yes. We'll talk about wearables performance on three levels, sales, margins and product delivery. For sales, we mentioned Q1 was below budget, still strong growth of over 400% and was 7% of our total sales. If you look at the factors for why under-budget, we're determining that wearables are a bit more of a seasonal business than traditional watches, so we should expect our mix to be a bit lower than in the front end of the year and higher as a percent of total business in the back half. We ended up pushing out a lot of our marketing in Q1, so there's very limited marketing and most of that is now aligned against Fossil and Kors and the other brands that we're launching in Q2 and Q3. And then it took a bit longer to solidify our expanded distribution through license or approval. So those are now largely in place and aligned with our updated sales goals through the year. So that's the summary, nothing specific around Kors. Those products are still performing very well. And for the rest of performance on wearables, margins are coming in better. So as you know, we've been  I mentioned on the last call, relentlessly working with our supply base on driving cost out. Those plans aren't fully solidified, but we've got line of sight to those margins improvements accruing sooner than we had originally forecasted. And then Q1 was  has been a significant amount of work as well on delivering on all of the product launches for the back half of the year, which remain on track. Edward J. Yruma - Pacific Crest Securities Thanks so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the wearables category. Could you talk about your inventory mix and how you are planning the business, traditional fashion watches versus wearables? Where you stand now? Where you expect that to be later in the year? And at retail, is there still a lot of traditional fashion watch inventory that needs to be worked through that's driving the promotions that are pressuring the gross margins a little bit as you try to kind of clear the desk for all the wearable launches in the second half? Thanks. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Yeah. No, I would say, we  you heard us say on the call our inventories are down 9%. The team here has been really focused on managing that well, within that 9% decline, we've been able to significantly invest in wearables, which is going to drive our growth and reduce our investments in the traditional business. So we're accomplishing a number of objectives, both in terms of positioning us well for growth and managing our capital. We think that the inventories are very clean. We've been reducing those inventories significantly. Our clearance this quarter was roughly flat to last  or a year ago rather, which has put some  a little bit of a headwind into the margins. But very pleased with the inventory position we're coming out of the quarter with. Gregory A. McKelvey - Fossil Group, Inc. In discounting, you're seeing, Omar, is what we actually referenced in our last call where we've got sharp opening price points to drive volume, particularly on Fossil. You'll continue to see that sharp price points with stepped-up marketing and dramatically improved process, I think that's the right recipe to drive this business. Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC Got it. Thanks. Good luck. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Oliver Chen of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC Hi. Thank you. As we look ahead, when should we expect the decline in traditional watches to stop or grow in terms of will the compares ease or are you feeling like there's the initiatives you're putting forward will start to drive demand or will that decline for the foreseeable future? And on the wearables side, can you just brief us on the marketplace, because I'm feeling like there's a lot of promotional intensity that could be out of your control in the marketplace. So how will you manage margins in that context and what can you do to try to manage a healthy demand profile on some items in terms of making sure that the margin march happens over time? Thank you. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Sure. Let me take the first part of that in terms of the sales trajectory. We've said for a while that our biggest challenge is really near-term visibility. You go back to last year, and we were fundamentally operating in a declining market when we were only operating in the traditional watch market. And coming out of the fourth quarter, when we had a strong showing of our wearables performance. We're now in a growing wrist device market that is 30%-plus bigger than that standalone traditional watch market. And that growth in that combined wrist device market is being fueled by connected watches. But we don't yet have all of our brands on their platform. We haven't fully developed the distribution for connected, so we're still in the earlier phases of that part of the evolution. So the near-term challenge is continuing to try to sequence the growth in connected against the headwinds in traditional. Connected again in the first quarter, which as Greg mentioned, is probably the least impactful quarter given the seasonality of that product, but it did drive double-digit improvement in the trajectories of Kors, very nearly the same in Fossil. So we're still seeing that wearables can be the catalyst to drive growth in the category. But specifically for 2017, the first quarter was our toughest compare. Remember, we had last year sell-in that we were up against, we've got fewer stores, we got currencies, but we do expect as we bring more connected on to the platform that see accelerating growth. Our second quarter guide is a sequential improvement to the first, and we expect that to accelerate as we move through the back half of the year. Gregory A. McKelvey - Fossil Group, Inc. And more specifically on your point around discounting and how we're seeing the market, on hybrids, I guess, I responded to this with Omar, and this is really about our  the price points that our elasticity curves are telling us drive volumes, were then translated into lower cost, which hit the margin profile we're looking for the year. Out of Q1, we're doing better than we thought. We're getting cost out even further and so we're on hybrids feeling good about our ability to continue to grow that business profitably. And that's really our own  there's nobody else driving the significant scale in that category like we are. On the smartwatch, I think the indicators we look for there is that we're still seeing very strong sell-through for our higher price point products with Michael Kors and the Access watch. We don't have significant discounting on those. We're still seeing that and then we're again intentionally using a high, low strategy on Fossil to drive strong opening price points and volume. So we are  I think, performing well in the marketplace and are effectively on track for our margin expectations. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. I would just add that we're perceiving significantly demand in wearables. If you look at IDC's latest research, it shows that the smartwatch business last year was about $19 billion, on its way to $35 billion by 2020. And we are  through our new distribution, through CE channels and all our existing distribution, we're seeing pretty significant demand out there that bodes well for our future in wearables. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. You know to kind of punctuate that. We still believe very strongly what we said last time in terms of the long-term that we have the opportunity to drive back to operating margins in those low-teens, driven by three major initiatives to return to a modest level of growth. And we think connected is showing us that we have the opportunity to do that. We've got to deliver New World Fossil, and we are well on our way to delivering the 2017 part of that and connected margins was the third. And you heard Greg say that, we have advanced the ball faster against that initiative this year already. So we certainly continue to believe that, that is an achievable goal for us. Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC Thanks for that. That's great. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Erinn Murphy of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a question on wholesale partner destocking, has that  traditional watches  has that trend accelerated? Is it flat sequentially or is it still declining? And then I guess just yesterday with Coach's announcement of the acquisition of Kate Spade. Does that change anything with the licensing relationship you have with Kate, I just don't know if there's change in control in that license that could impact, I think, it's through 2025, so just curious on that? Thanks. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Sure, on the wholesale business, I mean, overall, our traditional business performed pretty much in line with our expectations. Overall, we were a little bit stronger than we anticipated in the international market, a little bit behind in the U.S. but not a material change in the trajectory. So we had expected this and as we  again, we delivered our sales, in fact, into the overall traditional watch business we were actually a little bit ahead of our goals for the quarter. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. And as for Kate Spade, as you mentioned, we have a contract with them through 2025 and we are looking forward to working closely with the Kate Spade team and we're launching wearables this year in Kate Spade. The brand has been very successful on our portfolio. We think it's got a long-term future that could be very significant. So looking forward to working with the new team. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. And so there's no issue with change in control with Coach now being the owner of Kate and just know how that looked? Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. No, there's no change of control, either way in the contract. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. And then if I could just sneak one in on leathers, it was pretty challenging in the quarter, down 21%. Could you just elaborate what you are seeing and it's been obviously a very promotional category for several brands out there, but kind of how should we think about that trend throughout the balance of the year? Thank you. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. Yes, I think it's several things. First of all, I'd say we've had some product misses in our own assortment and we've been working with a design consultant that's been very helpful. We're kind of changing the entire profile of it. We've got a lot of new ideas, new materials and we're actually going to do some pre-testing of all those things on consumer panels, online consumer panels. So we're going out at it with a totally new approach. The other thing, as you mentioned, I think, the business has been tough overall. I think the latest NPD numbers for fourth quarter show that I think the total handbag business in United States was down 19%. So the market's tough, but we do think that with our position and our own stores and website, we're going to be able to have an opportunity long-term as we change the product and go after. One thing we are seeing, I think, from our Q is we're seeing a younger customer come into our store to buy wearable technology, I think we can leverage that into handbags. So we're looking forward to improving the business and moving forward with a larger opportunity in handbags. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Simeon Siegel of Nomura/Instinet. Your line is open. Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura Securities Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Can you quantify any cannibalization you may or may not be seeing, wearable versus traditionals? Dennis, I think when you said tripling wearables, any way to quantify how much would be incremental volume versus maybe a transfer from the traditional. And then just how do you view the sales trajectory of the wearable and traditionals over this year embedded within your guide? Thanks. Gregory A. McKelvey - Fossil Group, Inc. Okay. On cannibalization, I think there's four things to frame. First off, we don't give exact cannibalization numbers, but four ways to think about it. One, we're seeing the right consumer dynamics. So smartwatches in particular, despite smartwatches are in general a new customer that's coming in and they're high-quality customer. So, we're seeing generally younger, higher average basket size, so a lot of incrementality there. On hybrids, generally it's an existing traditional watch customer but there's a willingness to pay for more features and trade up to a higher average unit retail product. Second, we're seeing significant comp improvements from wearables. So it tells us there is significant amount of incrementality overall. Third, we're in this relentless pursuit to drive cost down quickly to get to the point where we're not going to care as cannibalization occurs, because we're selling higher average unit retail products at good enough margin to the point where it's accretive wherever the customer goes and where we've got line of sight to getting there. And then fourth, we have, with these differentiated products that are difficult to do with any reasonable scale with true branding and design, like we're doing on a global basis. With those advantages, we believe that we are not only transforming our business and unit volume in total, but we are competing in a much larger addressable market and we'll be taking share, significant share over time in both traditional watches and our expanded addressable market that includes wearables. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Yes, and just on the progression then through the year, traditional versus connected, the way we see that, as I mentioned just a minute ago, the traditional business overall as a portfolio, but generally performs a little bit ahead of our expectations. As we sort of trended out, we see sort of the upper end of our guidance, there was existing trends we're seeing sort of persisting very modest initiatives that we can capitalize and some emerging trends that we're seeing. And then at the lower end, we make an assumption that we see a further step-down in those historical trends beyond what we've already seen and observed in our historical data. So that's sort of a general assumption around the traditional business. On the connected business, it's much more of an accelerated growth, what we're seeing  the things to think about  we're talking about increasing our penetration significantly in wearables this year that's going to be more back-loaded. We're seasonalizing the business that we have during the first quarter, we're opening a lot of new doors this year. We're bringing new brands on to the platform, more display watches. We're assuming that we are going to see some better performance. We got better product coming in the market, slimmer product, which is going to attract new consumers, better technology, there continues to be enhanced awareness around the category that's being held by the competition, as well as the investments that we're making in marketing, better price product assortment, sharper price points and in fact, some of the recent data just published suggest that the wearables market is actually likely to be larger this year than last year. The latest estimate went from $17 billion to $19 billion in 2017. So there's a lot of work to be done, but there's a lot of fuel in the tank to drive those numbers. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. And it's really the investment in innovation and in our experience innovation always drives sales results and gets consumers excited in wrist devices. If you look at the overall watch business last year, it was minus 9%. And we're in a situation now where there's $2 billion colliding (45:22) wearables and watches together. It's a very exciting prospect to bring new consumers in there that may have not worn a watch before and to really disrupt the industry with innovation we think is very exciting. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Yes, and just to complete the point on how we're thinking about guidance. So what I described in connected more aligns with the upper end of our range. And then there is, obviously, execution risk, there's a lot of stuff to get done. So, the lower end of our range assumes we don't fully execute everything in that plan. Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura Securities Okay, thanks. Very helpful. And then if I can just for quick clarification, to your point about the balance sheet. Do you expect the incremental interest to go away this year or does that recur? And then just can you help anything that you are embedding for the other income line within the full year and the Q2 guides? Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. The interest  so with the new amended and extended facility, we had anticipated already in this year that there will be a higher interest. So we already embedded that into our guidance. There is an acceleration feature as we move through time, one later this year and then another next year. Whether it would be a further increase in interest expense, that's subject to  that would kick in if we don't pay down the existing $185 million term loan that we have outstanding today. And then with respect to the other  what we did say in the prepared remarks is that based on all of our assumptions in the current exchange rate environment that the net below the line kind of currency activity should be roughly similar to last year. Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura Securities Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Best of luck for the rest of the year. Gregory A. McKelvey - Fossil Group, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Anna Andreeva of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks so much. Couple of questions for us. I guess on wearables, can you elaborate what distribution you guys weren't able to get during the quarter? Was that U.S. or international? And should we think this is mostly across the CE channel or at department stores? And I guess are you expecting a catch-up in distribution as we go through the year? And then secondly, you mentioned there was a marketing expenses shift out of 1Q into 2Q and 3Q. What was the dollar amount? Thanks. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. We actually slowed down our distribution of wearables to some locations early this year, basically because we didn't  we were low on stock on our best-selling styles. We were chasing those, and we didn't feel it's prudent to really to go to a lot of new distribution until we had the full assortment, including the best-selling stock. So we've largely corrected that. So a lot of that's going out right now. So we do expect that we will have a very significant additional distribution this year, not only through our existing channel, but through CE channels, websites, et cetera, so we're getting into position to quantify that year, last year, with the first quarter being the real first initial push for wearables, that we had a concentration, a significant amount of our marketing investment that landed in the fourth quarter. This year, we see the timing we're investing, less in the first, Greg just explained that to you, more in the second launches coming into the late second and early third, more in the third relative to last year and then that turned into fourth. So you see the concentration moving away year-over-year from the first into fourth to the second and the third, we didn't quantify that. One other comment I'd make on advertising is that, as we mentioned, we've done a great job I think of reducing SG&A, including the fact that we've absorbed all our Misfit and wearables expenses into our SG&A and still have a smaller number. But we largely have not touched advertising. Our advertising is still going out pretty much the same that we had last couple of years. A lot of it is focused on wearables and not just at all types of media, but also a lot of training, point of sale and a lot of additional distribution, et cetera. So our marketing largely has not been affected as much as some of our other expenses. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open. Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group Good afternoon, everyone. As you think about and you chatted about the accelerating promotional environment, can you just qualitatively, are you seeing that across all channels? Is it more one category than another? And what drove the acceleration more recently? Is it less traffic? What are you seeing out there to put your arms around it? Thank you. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Yes, where we saw it principally was in our outlets, which has been a trend for the last several quarters (50:11). Operator Sir, you may respond to the question now. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. Can you please repeat the question? Operator, can you please repeat the question? Operator Yes, sir. Dana Telsey's line is still open. Gregory A. McKelvey - Fossil Group, Inc. Dana, would you like to repeat your question, please? We'll come back to that one. Operator... Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group Hi, can you hear me? Gregory A. McKelvey - Fossil Group, Inc. We can. Thank you, Dana. Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group Oh, good. I was just asking about as you think about the different channels and the promotional levels, what are you seeing by channel, is it different by channel, is it different by category with this accelerating promotions and what's changed more recently? Thank you. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Yes, I don't think the trend has continued. I think it's just the intensity, the level of promotion that we need to execute to drive the sales. So I think it is just another symptom of the same issue that's been recurring. It's always difficult to [Technical Difficulty] (53:36  54:20). Operator You can speak, sir. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. We haven't heard a question after Dana's. Operator Yes, sir. Our next question is from Randy Konik of Jefferies. Your line is open. Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC Can you hear me now? Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. We can. Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC Hey, guys. How are you? So, thanks for taking my question. I know there's some technical difficulties here. I feel like a lot of the call has been focused on the wearable product evolution, which I think is great. Although, right now, it's obviously only 7% of the business. So, just kind of what  how can we get comfort, I think what the market's looking for is how do we kind of think about the traditional watch business, and where those unit volumes kind of start to bottom out and why? And kind of walk us through your thought process on that scenario? And then I guess just a follow-up around distribution, it sounded like you said like look, we're looking to more CE channels, et cetera. And you did a good job of reducing your store count. I guess what I'm trying to get towards is what does the distribution footprint need to look like as the product strategy is morphed and the market itself is changed? So I'm just trying to get some help on that traditional watch market, where does it stabilize? I think that's the most important part of the story and then just the distribution angle around it. Thanks. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. Well, as we mentioned before, one of the issues we have is the lack of visibility and exactly when we'll see the bottom in the traditional watch business. Just overall, our number one objective is to continue to gain share in the watch business. We just think the way to do that right now is with technology. So we have identified several trends in traditional watches that we are distorting right now to go after it. But the biggest trend that we're going after which is clear to us and the demand is all there is in wearables. So if you take our existing distribution where the stores that we sell to have all embraced the idea of wearable technology, they still have a big business obviously in traditional watches, and we're putting new materials and new ideas and new thoughts in there as we migrate towards a larger number of wearables. It is bringing younger customers in the store, largely haven't worn watches before. So we're starting to see more relevancy in the watch business. In addition to that, we've expanded to sell to CE channel, which are  most of those CE channels are selling display smartwatches and hybrids. And we're seeing very good sales across the board in that channel. So I would say the entire industry is really seeing the two businesses collide, wearables and traditional watches. It's giving us additional channels, it's giving our existing distribution additional customers coming into the store and it's giving us a larger addressable market. So I think all in all, we just got to play through it. We do not have the visibility and when the traditional watch business will level off. But what we do know is when we have wearables in a certain brand, whether it's Kors or Fossil, that the comps are dramatically different when we have wearables and traditional watches in the same environment. And that we think will accelerate as time goes on. Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC And then just may I ask then, Dennis, when you gave the annual revenue guidance or the updated revenue guidance for the year, is there a way we can get the assumption of what the traditional watch business is assumed to be declining at? And how that compares to the first quarter trend? Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Well, we've given you the overall  the watch decline in the release. We haven't disclosed the specifics around traditional versus connected. But again, the way we view just the trends on that traditional business is to continue at a decline, at the pace we've been seeing on the upper end and then at the lower end to expect some level of further erosion. That is largely the big part of the change in the  or the width of the range. There's really two risks identified in that range, it's that further step down in the traditional business and then execution risk in delivering our connected agenda this year. Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC Understood. Thank you. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. You bet. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hey, sorry, guys. Can you hear me? Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. We can. Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Sorry about that. I just wanted to go back to the question that Simeon asked about cannibalization. I mean, the only reason I want to ask you again is, clearly the macro is tough out there, but the traditional watch business took a pretty  it took a big step back in Q4 and it's kind of remained in that run rate in Q1 and that coincides with the launch of wearables. So, I'm just kind of curious, like, whatever work you've done around cannibalization within the traditional watch business, can you share anything with us? Because I'm really trying to understand, if you sell more wearables, are you sure that you're cannibalizing your high margin existing watch business while you do that and scale that business? Just how do you balance both of those businesses together given the different margin dynamics? Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Yes, I mean  let's see. We don't have specific data that we're able to share with you. But, I mean, one way to look at it is kind of refer to what I said earlier about the change in the market. So up until last year, we were operating the market that was declining because we were limited to that traditional watch market. There were other choices that consumers could make in terms of technology. Our challenge was we couldn't get that customer. The other choice that the customer was making, we did not benefit it. So, in a certain sense, you might say that over the last couple of years really arguably into the back half of last year, we were being  using the term loosely, sort of, cannibalized by others in the marketplace. Now we are in a position, early stages though because we don't have all of our brands in the platform, but now we are in a position to take advantage of that preference from some of the consumers, moving away from traditional watches into connected watches. And that we believe will grow as we bring more products into the market as we bring better products into the market, more brands into the market, expand our distribution, we will be in a better position to win that customer when a year ago when we didn't have  we virtually had no offering in connect, so we didn't win that. We've changed our competitive position significantly in the last 12 months. Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our last question is from Heather Balsky of Bank of America. Your line is open. Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just talk about New World Fossil and just remind us, what is the split of the 200 million of operating margin opportunity in terms of SG&A and the benefit to gross margin? And then you talked about accelerating some of the cost benefits into 2017. What are those benefits that you think you can accelerate? Thanks. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Sure. So, we haven't specifically broken out all the components, but what we said is that our goal was to invest. Initially, we thought it would be about $150 million in restructuring charges. That will likely be lower as we've reduced some of the store closure plans. But that was largely then to drive a portfolio of improvements that will go into a number of buckets, the total of which is roughly $200 million and it included optimizing and gaining efficiencies in our infrastructure and our organizational structure, improving our ability to leverage our volumes in both our direct and indirect sourcing, designing with a better view to the feature set that a customer was willing to pay for to ultimately eliminate features that just add costs but really don't motivate the consumer to buy. And then focusing on category management more tightly, looking at our SKU counts, reducing them and become much more efficient with the way we build our product plant. So that whole portfolio is designed to deliver roughly $200 million of profit improvements over the life of the program. The core organization is laser-focused on this. We did a lot of work last year and much of that work is going to drive the benefit that we're seeing in 2017. Based on the way we've measured, we think that we will deliver that 40% of that goal in 2017 and then some of the margin benefits take a little longer to cycle through because you have to deal with the design calendars and production calendars before those benefits actually flow through a P&L. But we think we've made a lot of progress, and we're on good track to deliver. Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thank you. And just one quick question in terms of your wholesale sales, in terms of department store closures, how much of an impact do you think you saw in the first quarter? And how are you thinking about the rest of the year? Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. I would say it's relatively small. As you know, we're closing some of the small doors. We're seeing some of those sales obviously migrate to online, and we don't really expect through this year to be a significant number. In addition to that, of course, we're adding a lot of additional distribution that will offset some of that. So we don't think it's a big impact to us. Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Secor for closing remarks. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Thank you very much. First, let me say that we understand there was some technical difficulties on the call.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Our first question is from Ed Yruma of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Edward J. Yruma - Pacific Crest Securities Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I know you indicated that sell-in on wearables was a little bit short of plans, I guess any specificity there would be helpful. I know you gave some color around the Fossil lift for wearables, but how did the Michael Kors wearable performance shake out? And was some of the weaker sell-in due to the potential for orders that maybe got pushed out toward the back end of the year? Thank you. Gregory A. McKelvey - Fossil Group, Inc. Yes. We'll talk about wearables performance on three levels, sales, margins and product delivery. For sales, we mentioned Q1 was below budget, still strong growth of over 400% and was 7% of our total sales. If you look at the factors for why under-budget, we're determining that wearables are a bit more of a seasonal business than traditional watches, so we should expect our mix to be a bit lower than in the front end of the year and higher as a percent of total business in the back half. We ended up pushing out a lot of our marketing in Q1, so there's very limited marketing and most of that is now aligned against Fossil and Kors and the other brands that we're launching in Q2 and Q3. And then it took a bit longer to solidify our expanded distribution through license or approval. So those are now largely in place and aligned with our updated sales goals through the year. So that's the summary, nothing specific around Kors. Those products are still performing very well. And for the rest of performance on wearables, margins are coming in better. So as you know, we've been  I mentioned on the last call, relentlessly working with our supply base on driving cost out. Those plans aren't fully solidified, but we've got line of sight to those margins improvements accruing sooner than we had originally forecasted. And then Q1 was  has been a significant amount of work as well on delivering on all of the product launches for the back half of the year, which remain on track. Edward J. Yruma - Pacific Crest Securities Thanks so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the wearables category. Could you talk about your inventory mix and how you are planning the business, traditional fashion watches versus wearables? Where you stand now? Where you expect that to be later in the year? And at retail, is there still a lot of traditional fashion watch inventory that needs to be worked through that's driving the promotions that are pressuring the gross margins a little bit as you try to kind of clear the desk for all the wearable launches in the second half? Thanks. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Yeah. No, I would say, we  you heard us say on the call our inventories are down 9%. The team here has been really focused on managing that well, within that 9% decline, we've been able to significantly invest in wearables, which is going to drive our growth and reduce our investments in the traditional business. So we're accomplishing a number of objectives, both in terms of positioning us well for growth and managing our capital. We think that the inventories are very clean. We've been reducing those inventories significantly. Our clearance this quarter was roughly flat to last  or a year ago rather, which has put some  a little bit of a headwind into the margins. But very pleased with the inventory position we're coming out of the quarter with. Gregory A. McKelvey - Fossil Group, Inc. In discounting, you're seeing, Omar, is what we actually referenced in our last call where we've got sharp opening price points to drive volume, particularly on Fossil. You'll continue to see that sharp price points with stepped-up marketing and dramatically improved process, I think that's the right recipe to drive this business. Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC Got it. Thanks. Good luck. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Oliver Chen of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC Hi. Thank you. As we look ahead, when should we expect the decline in traditional watches to stop or grow in terms of will the compares ease or are you feeling like there's the initiatives you're putting forward will start to drive demand or will that decline for the foreseeable future? And on the wearables side, can you just brief us on the marketplace, because I'm feeling like there's a lot of promotional intensity that could be out of your control in the marketplace. So how will you manage margins in that context and what can you do to try to manage a healthy demand profile on some items in terms of making sure that the margin march happens over time? Thank you. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Sure. Let me take the first part of that in terms of the sales trajectory. We've said for a while that our biggest challenge is really near-term visibility. You go back to last year, and we were fundamentally operating in a declining market when we were only operating in the traditional watch market. And coming out of the fourth quarter, when we had a strong showing of our wearables performance. We're now in a growing wrist device market that is 30%-plus bigger than that standalone traditional watch market. And that growth in that combined wrist device market is being fueled by connected watches. But we don't yet have all of our brands on their platform. We haven't fully developed the distribution for connected, so we're still in the earlier phases of that part of the evolution. So the near-term challenge is continuing to try to sequence the growth in connected against the headwinds in traditional. Connected again in the first quarter, which as Greg mentioned, is probably the least impactful quarter given the seasonality of that product, but it did drive double-digit improvement in the trajectories of Kors, very nearly the same in Fossil. So we're still seeing that wearables can be the catalyst to drive growth in the category. But specifically for 2017, the first quarter was our toughest compare. Remember, we had last year sell-in that we were up against, we've got fewer stores, we got currencies, but we do expect as we bring more connected on to the platform that see accelerating growth. Our second quarter guide is a sequential improvement to the first, and we expect that to accelerate as we move through the back half of the year. Gregory A. McKelvey - Fossil Group, Inc. And more specifically on your point around discounting and how we're seeing the market, on hybrids, I guess, I responded to this with Omar, and this is really about our  the price points that our elasticity curves are telling us drive volumes, were then translated into lower cost, which hit the margin profile we're looking for the year. Out of Q1, we're doing better than we thought. We're getting cost out even further and so we're on hybrids feeling good about our ability to continue to grow that business profitably. And that's really our own  there's nobody else driving the significant scale in that category like we are. On the smartwatch, I think the indicators we look for there is that we're still seeing very strong sell-through for our higher price point products with Michael Kors and the Access watch. We don't have significant discounting on those. We're still seeing that and then we're again intentionally using a high, low strategy on Fossil to drive strong opening price points and volume. So we are  I think, performing well in the marketplace and are effectively on track for our margin expectations. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. I would just add that we're perceiving significantly demand in wearables. If you look at IDC's latest research, it shows that the smartwatch business last year was about $19 billion, on its way to $35 billion by 2020. And we are  through our new distribution, through CE channels and all our existing distribution, we're seeing pretty significant demand out there that bodes well for our future in wearables. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. You know to kind of punctuate that. We still believe very strongly what we said last time in terms of the long-term that we have the opportunity to drive back to operating margins in those low-teens, driven by three major initiatives to return to a modest level of growth. And we think connected is showing us that we have the opportunity to do that. We've got to deliver New World Fossil, and we are well on our way to delivering the 2017 part of that and connected margins was the third. And you heard Greg say that, we have advanced the ball faster against that initiative this year already. So we certainly continue to believe that, that is an achievable goal for us. Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC Thanks for that. That's great. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Erinn Murphy of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a question on wholesale partner destocking, has that  traditional watches  has that trend accelerated? Is it flat sequentially or is it still declining? And then I guess just yesterday with Coach's announcement of the acquisition of Kate Spade. Does that change anything with the licensing relationship you have with Kate, I just don't know if there's change in control in that license that could impact, I think, it's through 2025, so just curious on that? Thanks. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Sure, on the wholesale business, I mean, overall, our traditional business performed pretty much in line with our expectations. Overall, we were a little bit stronger than we anticipated in the international market, a little bit behind in the U.S. but not a material change in the trajectory. So we had expected this and as we  again, we delivered our sales, in fact, into the overall traditional watch business we were actually a little bit ahead of our goals for the quarter. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. And as for Kate Spade, as you mentioned, we have a contract with them through 2025 and we are looking forward to working closely with the Kate Spade team and we're launching wearables this year in Kate Spade. The brand has been very successful on our portfolio. We think it's got a long-term future that could be very significant. So looking forward to working with the new team. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. And so there's no issue with change in control with Coach now being the owner of Kate and just know how that looked? Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. No, there's no change of control, either way in the contract. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. And then if I could just sneak one in on leathers, it was pretty challenging in the quarter, down 21%. Could you just elaborate what you are seeing and it's been obviously a very promotional category for several brands out there, but kind of how should we think about that trend throughout the balance of the year? Thank you. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. Yes, I think it's several things. First of all, I'd say we've had some product misses in our own assortment and we've been working with a design consultant that's been very helpful. We're kind of changing the entire profile of it. We've got a lot of new ideas, new materials and we're actually going to do some pre-testing of all those things on consumer panels, online consumer panels. So we're going out at it with a totally new approach. The other thing, as you mentioned, I think, the business has been tough overall. I think the latest NPD numbers for fourth quarter show that I think the total handbag business in United States was down 19%. So the market's tough, but we do think that with our position and our own stores and website, we're going to be able to have an opportunity long-term as we change the product and go after. One thing we are seeing, I think, from our Q is we're seeing a younger customer come into our store to buy wearable technology, I think we can leverage that into handbags. So we're looking forward to improving the business and moving forward with a larger opportunity in handbags. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Simeon Siegel of Nomura/Instinet. Your line is open. Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura Securities Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Can you quantify any cannibalization you may or may not be seeing, wearable versus traditionals? Dennis, I think when you said tripling wearables, any way to quantify how much would be incremental volume versus maybe a transfer from the traditional. And then just how do you view the sales trajectory of the wearable and traditionals over this year embedded within your guide? Thanks. Gregory A. McKelvey - Fossil Group, Inc. Okay. On cannibalization, I think there's four things to frame. First off, we don't give exact cannibalization numbers, but four ways to think about it. One, we're seeing the right consumer dynamics. So smartwatches in particular, despite smartwatches are in general a new customer that's coming in and they're high-quality customer. So, we're seeing generally younger, higher average basket size, so a lot of incrementality there. On hybrids, generally it's an existing traditional watch customer but there's a willingness to pay for more features and trade up to a higher average unit retail product. Second, we're seeing significant comp improvements from wearables. So it tells us there is significant amount of incrementality overall. Third, we're in this relentless pursuit to drive cost down quickly to get to the point where we're not going to care as cannibalization occurs, because we're selling higher average unit retail products at good enough margin to the point where it's accretive wherever the customer goes and where we've got line of sight to getting there. And then fourth, we have, with these differentiated products that are difficult to do with any reasonable scale with true branding and design, like we're doing on a global basis. With those advantages, we believe that we are not only transforming our business and unit volume in total, but we are competing in a much larger addressable market and we'll be taking share, significant share over time in both traditional watches and our expanded addressable market that includes wearables. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Yes, and just on the progression then through the year, traditional versus connected, the way we see that, as I mentioned just a minute ago, the traditional business overall as a portfolio, but generally performs a little bit ahead of our expectations. As we sort of trended out, we see sort of the upper end of our guidance, there was existing trends we're seeing sort of persisting very modest initiatives that we can capitalize and some emerging trends that we're seeing. And then at the lower end, we make an assumption that we see a further step-down in those historical trends beyond what we've already seen and observed in our historical data. So that's sort of a general assumption around the traditional business. On the connected business, it's much more of an accelerated growth, what we're seeing  the things to think about  we're talking about increasing our penetration significantly in wearables this year that's going to be more back-loaded. We're seasonalizing the business that we have during the first quarter, we're opening a lot of new doors this year. We're bringing new brands on to the platform, more display watches. We're assuming that we are going to see some better performance. We got better product coming in the market, slimmer product, which is going to attract new consumers, better technology, there continues to be enhanced awareness around the category that's being held by the competition, as well as the investments that we're making in marketing, better price product assortment, sharper price points and in fact, some of the recent data just published suggest that the wearables market is actually likely to be larger this year than last year. The latest estimate went from $17 billion to $19 billion in 2017. So there's a lot of work to be done, but there's a lot of fuel in the tank to drive those numbers. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. And it's really the investment in innovation and in our experience innovation always drives sales results and gets consumers excited in wrist devices. If you look at the overall watch business last year, it was minus 9%. And we're in a situation now where there's $2 billion colliding (45:22) wearables and watches together. It's a very exciting prospect to bring new consumers in there that may have not worn a watch before and to really disrupt the industry with innovation we think is very exciting. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Yes, and just to complete the point on how we're thinking about guidance. So what I described in connected more aligns with the upper end of our range. And then there is, obviously, execution risk, there's a lot of stuff to get done. So, the lower end of our range assumes we don't fully execute everything in that plan. Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura Securities Okay, thanks. Very helpful. And then if I can just for quick clarification, to your point about the balance sheet. Do you expect the incremental interest to go away this year or does that recur? And then just can you help anything that you are embedding for the other income line within the full year and the Q2 guides? Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. The interest  so with the new amended and extended facility, we had anticipated already in this year that there will be a higher interest. So we already embedded that into our guidance. There is an acceleration feature as we move through time, one later this year and then another next year. Whether it would be a further increase in interest expense, that's subject to  that would kick in if we don't pay down the existing $185 million term loan that we have outstanding today. And then with respect to the other  what we did say in the prepared remarks is that based on all of our assumptions in the current exchange rate environment that the net below the line kind of currency activity should be roughly similar to last year. Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura Securities Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Best of luck for the rest of the year. Gregory A. McKelvey - Fossil Group, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Anna Andreeva of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Anna Andreeva - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks so much. Couple of questions for us. I guess on wearables, can you elaborate what distribution you guys weren't able to get during the quarter? Was that U.S. or international? And should we think this is mostly across the CE channel or at department stores? And I guess are you expecting a catch-up in distribution as we go through the year? And then secondly, you mentioned there was a marketing expenses shift out of 1Q into 2Q and 3Q. What was the dollar amount? Thanks. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. We actually slowed down our distribution of wearables to some locations early this year, basically because we didn't  we were low on stock on our best-selling styles. We were chasing those, and we didn't feel it's prudent to really to go to a lot of new distribution until we had the full assortment, including the best-selling stock. So we've largely corrected that. So a lot of that's going out right now. So we do expect that we will have a very significant additional distribution this year, not only through our existing channel, but through CE channels, websites, et cetera, so we're getting into position to quantify that year, last year, with the first quarter being the real first initial push for wearables, that we had a concentration, a significant amount of our marketing investment that landed in the fourth quarter. This year, we see the timing we're investing, less in the first, Greg just explained that to you, more in the second launches coming into the late second and early third, more in the third relative to last year and then that turned into fourth. So you see the concentration moving away year-over-year from the first into fourth to the second and the third, we didn't quantify that. One other comment I'd make on advertising is that, as we mentioned, we've done a great job I think of reducing SG&A, including the fact that we've absorbed all our Misfit and wearables expenses into our SG&A and still have a smaller number. But we largely have not touched advertising. Our advertising is still going out pretty much the same that we had last couple of years. A lot of it is focused on wearables and not just at all types of media, but also a lot of training, point of sale and a lot of additional distribution, et cetera. So our marketing largely has not been affected as much as some of our other expenses. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open. Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group Good afternoon, everyone. As you think about and you chatted about the accelerating promotional environment, can you just qualitatively, are you seeing that across all channels? Is it more one category than another? And what drove the acceleration more recently? Is it less traffic? What are you seeing out there to put your arms around it? Thank you. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Yes, where we saw it principally was in our outlets, which has been a trend for the last several quarters (50:11). Operator Sir, you may respond to the question now. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. Can you please repeat the question? Operator, can you please repeat the question? Operator Yes, sir. Dana Telsey's line is still open. Gregory A. McKelvey - Fossil Group, Inc. Dana, would you like to repeat your question, please? We'll come back to that one. Operator... Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group Hi, can you hear me? Gregory A. McKelvey - Fossil Group, Inc. We can. Thank you, Dana. Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group Oh, good. I was just asking about as you think about the different channels and the promotional levels, what are you seeing by channel, is it different by channel, is it different by category with this accelerating promotions and what's changed more recently? Thank you. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Yes, I don't think the trend has continued. I think it's just the intensity, the level of promotion that we need to execute to drive the sales. So I think it is just another symptom of the same issue that's been recurring. It's always difficult to [Technical Difficulty] (53:36  54:20). Operator You can speak, sir. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. We haven't heard a question after Dana's. Operator Yes, sir. Our next question is from Randy Konik of Jefferies. Your line is open. Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC Can you hear me now? Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. We can. Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC Hey, guys. How are you? So, thanks for taking my question. I know there's some technical difficulties here. I feel like a lot of the call has been focused on the wearable product evolution, which I think is great. Although, right now, it's obviously only 7% of the business. So, just kind of what  how can we get comfort, I think what the market's looking for is how do we kind of think about the traditional watch business, and where those unit volumes kind of start to bottom out and why? And kind of walk us through your thought process on that scenario? And then I guess just a follow-up around distribution, it sounded like you said like look, we're looking to more CE channels, et cetera. And you did a good job of reducing your store count. I guess what I'm trying to get towards is what does the distribution footprint need to look like as the product strategy is morphed and the market itself is changed? So I'm just trying to get some help on that traditional watch market, where does it stabilize? I think that's the most important part of the story and then just the distribution angle around it. Thanks. Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. Well, as we mentioned before, one of the issues we have is the lack of visibility and exactly when we'll see the bottom in the traditional watch business. Just overall, our number one objective is to continue to gain share in the watch business. We just think the way to do that right now is with technology. So we have identified several trends in traditional watches that we are distorting right now to go after it. But the biggest trend that we're going after which is clear to us and the demand is all there is in wearables. So if you take our existing distribution where the stores that we sell to have all embraced the idea of wearable technology, they still have a big business obviously in traditional watches, and we're putting new materials and new ideas and new thoughts in there as we migrate towards a larger number of wearables. It is bringing younger customers in the store, largely haven't worn watches before. So we're starting to see more relevancy in the watch business. In addition to that, we've expanded to sell to CE channel, which are  most of those CE channels are selling display smartwatches and hybrids. And we're seeing very good sales across the board in that channel. So I would say the entire industry is really seeing the two businesses collide, wearables and traditional watches. It's giving us additional channels, it's giving our existing distribution additional customers coming into the store and it's giving us a larger addressable market. So I think all in all, we just got to play through it. We do not have the visibility and when the traditional watch business will level off. But what we do know is when we have wearables in a certain brand, whether it's Kors or Fossil, that the comps are dramatically different when we have wearables and traditional watches in the same environment. And that we think will accelerate as time goes on. Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC And then just may I ask then, Dennis, when you gave the annual revenue guidance or the updated revenue guidance for the year, is there a way we can get the assumption of what the traditional watch business is assumed to be declining at? And how that compares to the first quarter trend? Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Well, we've given you the overall  the watch decline in the release. We haven't disclosed the specifics around traditional versus connected. But again, the way we view just the trends on that traditional business is to continue at a decline, at the pace we've been seeing on the upper end and then at the lower end to expect some level of further erosion. That is largely the big part of the change in the  or the width of the range. There's really two risks identified in that range, it's that further step down in the traditional business and then execution risk in delivering our connected agenda this year. Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC Understood. Thank you. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. You bet. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hey, sorry, guys. Can you hear me? Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. We can. Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Sorry about that. I just wanted to go back to the question that Simeon asked about cannibalization. I mean, the only reason I want to ask you again is, clearly the macro is tough out there, but the traditional watch business took a pretty  it took a big step back in Q4 and it's kind of remained in that run rate in Q1 and that coincides with the launch of wearables. So, I'm just kind of curious, like, whatever work you've done around cannibalization within the traditional watch business, can you share anything with us? Because I'm really trying to understand, if you sell more wearables, are you sure that you're cannibalizing your high margin existing watch business while you do that and scale that business? Just how do you balance both of those businesses together given the different margin dynamics? Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Yes, I mean  let's see. We don't have specific data that we're able to share with you. But, I mean, one way to look at it is kind of refer to what I said earlier about the change in the market. So up until last year, we were operating the market that was declining because we were limited to that traditional watch market. There were other choices that consumers could make in terms of technology. Our challenge was we couldn't get that customer. The other choice that the customer was making, we did not benefit it. So, in a certain sense, you might say that over the last couple of years really arguably into the back half of last year, we were being  using the term loosely, sort of, cannibalized by others in the marketplace. Now we are in a position, early stages though because we don't have all of our brands in the platform, but now we are in a position to take advantage of that preference from some of the consumers, moving away from traditional watches into connected watches. And that we believe will grow as we bring more products into the market as we bring better products into the market, more brands into the market, expand our distribution, we will be in a better position to win that customer when a year ago when we didn't have  we virtually had no offering in connect, so we didn't win that. We've changed our competitive position significantly in the last 12 months. Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our last question is from Heather Balsky of Bank of America. Your line is open. Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just talk about New World Fossil and just remind us, what is the split of the 200 million of operating margin opportunity in terms of SG&A and the benefit to gross margin? And then you talked about accelerating some of the cost benefits into 2017. What are those benefits that you think you can accelerate? Thanks. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc. Sure. So, we haven't specifically broken out all the components, but what we said is that our goal was to invest. Initially, we thought it would be about $150 million in restructuring charges. That will likely be lower as we've reduced some of the store closure plans. But that was largely then to drive a portfolio of improvements that will go into a number of buckets, the total of which is roughly $200 million and it included optimizing and gaining efficiencies in our infrastructure and our organizational structure, improving our ability to leverage our volumes in both our direct and indirect sourcing, designing with a better view to the feature set that a customer was willing to pay for to ultimately eliminate features that just add costs but really don't motivate the consumer to buy. And then focusing on category management more tightly, looking at our SKU counts, reducing them and become much more efficient with the way we build our product plant. So that whole portfolio is designed to deliver roughly $200 million of profit improvements over the life of the program. The core organization is laser-focused on this. We did a lot of work last year and much of that work is going to drive the benefit that we're seeing in 2017. Based on the way we've measured, we think that we will deliver that 40% of that goal in 2017 and then some of the margin benefits take a little longer to cycle through because you have to deal with the design calendars and production calendars before those benefits actually flow through a P&L. But we think we've made a lot of progress, and we're on good track to deliver. Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thank you. And just one quick question in terms of your wholesale sales, in terms of department store closures, how much of an impact do you think you saw in the first quarter? And how are you thinking about the rest of the year? Kosta N. Kartsotis - Fossil Group, Inc. I would say it's relatively small. As you know, we're closing some of the small doors. We're seeing some of those sales obviously migrate to online, and we don't really expect through this year to be a significant number. In addition to that, of course, we're adding a lot of additional distribution that will offset some of that. So we don't think it's a big impact to us. Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Secor for closing remarks. Dennis R. Secor - Fossil Group, Inc.

(NASDAQ: FOXA ) Q3 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call May 10, 2017, 04:30 PM ET Executives Reed Nolte - EVP, IR Lachlan Murdoch - Executive Chairman John Nallen - CFO James Murdoch - CEO Analysts Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson John Janedis - Jefferies Doug Mitchelson - UBS Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley Marci Ryvicke - Wells Fargo Operator Welcome to the Twenty-First Century Fox Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Reed Nolte Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. On the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chairman; James Murdoch, Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen; our Chief Financial Officer. First, well give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and then well be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to Twenty-First Century Foxs business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The companys Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2017 identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ. And these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of, and reconciliation, of such measures can be found in our earnings release and in our 10-Q filing. Please note that certain financial measures used on this call, such as segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release. And lastly, please note that our offer for Sky plc that was announced last December is governed by the U.K. Takeover Code. As such, there are strict limitations as to what we can say with respect to that transaction and we are restricted to providing information that has been publicly announced. And with that, Im pleased to turn it over to Lachlan. Lachlan Murdoch Thanks Reed, good afternoon everyone. I apologize for cold that I have. We are pleased to have delivered another quarter of solid growth. The strength of these results generated the highest core earnings per share in the company's history. This record results reflect continued positive progress across our businesses with revenue and EBITDA growth coming from both our Cable Networks and Television segments. And whilst earnings at the film studio decreased when compared to one of our most profitable film quarters ever in the prior year when we benefited significantly from Deadpool, they were robust nonetheless. Importantly we have driven our business forward against all our strategic priorities to growing the distribution of our video brands on both traditional and demand emerging platforms, to innovative digital advertising products and partnerships such as OpenAP and most critically to delivering outstanding sports and news broadcasting. In fact, the scale and health of our sports and news broadcasting businesses continue to be differentiator for us with over half of the company's advertising revenues earned in these zones. Of course we had an incredible Super Bowl but we also saw viewership gains for the Daytona 500 on FBC and for MLS Soccer on Fox Sports 1 which for the first time beat ESPN2 for entire month in February. Additionally viewership at our regional sports networks continues to be exceptionally strong with major league baseball leading the way. Yankees ratings are up 39% over last season and the Atlanta Braves ratings are up over 54% this season so far. The business is in great shape with all expiring team rights deals satisfactorily renewed. Not to be outdone, Fox News is the number one basic cable channel in both total day and prime time viewing for 61 consecutive quarters. In fact, Fox News has delivered its highest rated quarter ever rating strength we expect to continue. In scripted programming our partnerships with the world's best storytellers continue to produce groundbreaking new series that drives a long-term value of our core brands. FX debuted successful first seasons of Taboo, Legion and Feud adding to the networks reputation as a creative powerhouse. National Geographic has made great progress in its goal to more closely align its programming with its brand. The recent Genius premier from producers Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, Nat Geo's first scripted anthology series, drew over 4 million viewers in the U.S. alone and was distributed further across the global reach of the National Geographic International channels. The Fox Broadcasting networks mixed performance in ratings this season has been frustrating for all. So we are encouraged by our development for the fall and look forward to presenting a strong schedule at our upfront this Monday. Of course the network does provide our TV studio a powerful launch platform for it shows and it is important to consider these two businesses together. Twenty-First Century Fox television is coming of a stellar 2016-2017 broadcast season. This past year our TV studio produced a number one show on five different networks including Empire on Fox, American Crime Story on FX, Modern Family on ABC, This Is Us on NBC, and American Dad! on TBS. The solid performance of our film studio with the box office successes of Logan and Hidden Figures underscore the range and quality of what we bring our audiences. Looking out over the next year, we feel good about our slate when Alien: Covenant directed by Ridley Scott coming later this month, followed by War for the Planet of the Apes in July, Kingsman: The Golden Circle in September and The Greatest Showman at Christmas. We've also recently announced the June 2018 release of Deadpool 2 something my young boys are wildly looking forward to but which they won't be allowed to watch. Turning to our international businesses, the financial impact of the Indian demonetization we believe is behind us but the financial impact has obscured impressive operational progress, most notably Star India is increasing its viewership lead over our competitors and the continued rise and rise of Hotstar as the emerging platform of choice in India. James will have some more to say about that in a few minutes. The company continues to attract great new leaders such as Amy Listerman, who has joined us as Fox News CFO and Marianne Gambelli was has joined us as President of Fox News' Advertising Sales and we welcome them to the company. We feel good about where we and confident that the strategic plan we continue to execute against is differentiating us from our competitors and building long-term value across our businesses. With that, I'll hand it over to John. John Nallen Thanks Lachlan, and good afternoon everyone. Today we reported another strong quarter of financial results posting double-digit gains in adjusted earnings per share and growth in EBITDA despite the very difficult year-over-year comparisons at our film segment which Lachlan referred to. Third quarter revenues increased $336 million or 5% to $7.56 billion led by higher advertising revenues at the Television segment from the broadcast of this year Super Bowl and affiliate revenue growth at the Cable Networks segment. This was partially offset by slightly lower content revenues at the Film segment. Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.94 billion, a 3% increase from the prior year reflecting double-digit increases at our Television segment and mid-single digit growth at the Cable Networks offset in part by lower Film segment results from the challenging comp to a year ago. From a bottom-line perspective we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $811 million or $0.44 per share. This quarter included charges of $142 million reported in other net which primarily represents the fair value adjustments on currency hedges related to the pending sky transaction. Excluding the net income effect in both years of other net, impairment and restructuring and equity earnings adjustments, third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.54 which is a 15% increase over the comparable $0.47 reported a year ago. So, now turning to the performance of our operating segments for the third quarter. The Cable Network segment reported EBITDA of $1.45 billion up 5% on revenue growth of 2% with total segment expenses pretty much unchanged from last year. Domestic cable revenues increased 6% led by affiliate fee growth of 8% which reflects higher average rates across all of our brands. Domestic ad revenues were equal to the prior year as increases from the rating strength at Fox News, and at FS1 were offset by reductions from the non-channel businesses at Nat Geo Partners. EBITDA at our domestic channel was equal to the prior year as higher revenues were offset by increased investments in programming most notably the planned investments to support our expansion of original series at FX and the new programming initiative at Nat Geo, as well as contractual sports rights step ups. Third quarter reported international cable revenues declined 7%, as low advertising and syndication revenues were partially offset by mid-single-digit affiliate fee growth. Reported advertising revenues were as expected down 18% versus the prior year principally due to the absence of Stars prior year broadcast of the ICC T20 World Cup and Asia Cup cricket tournaments, and the continued negative impact from India's demonetization initiative. Now while the major effects of demonetization are now behind us, it negatively impacted the third quarter revenue by approximately $20 million. Reported internationally EBITDA contribution increased 44% primarily due to the lower sports programming costs at Star and affiliate fee growth. At our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $190 million increased 52% from last year on revenue increases of 30%. This revenue growth was driven by our broadcast of this year Super Bowl where we generated approximately $500 million in gross revenues on Super Bowl Sunday and from continued retransmission consent revenue growth. These increases more than offset the impact of lower primetime entertainment ratings from the absence of American Idol. At the Film segment, third quarter EBITDA of $373 million was $97 million below year ago. This quarter is very solid earnings were led by the theatrical releases of Logan and Hidden Figures and higher television production contributions from the licensing of American Crime Story and Homeland. The comparisons to last year's third quarter as Lachlan mentioned are challenging since last year included significant contributions from the theatrical release of Deadpool and the home entertainment release of the Martian. These difficult comparisons will continue in the fourth quarter from the ongoing strength of these films last year, as well as from the quarterly timing of spot sales and reduced syndication sales versus last year's fourth quarter. And finally from a balance sheet perspective we continue to accumulate cash reflecting our priority to point our capital toward the planned acquisition of Sky. And with that, let me turn it over to James. James Murdoch Thanks very much, John and good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today. So as you've heard the first nine months of the fiscal year have been strong and we made good progress on a number of fronts, but I just like to spend a minute or two addressing some of the key things we've been seeing in the marketplace and share some thoughts on our priorities going forward. So a few points to make on the following subjects. The advertising trends and performance, the distribution universe for our video brands, and the velocity of the business in terms of revenue that might not be so obvious at first glance. So first of all we're very pleased with the advertising performance in the quarter which grew 16% companywide year-over-year. Now obviously as mentioned at Super Bowl was a major contributor which was offset in part by the lack of both the Asia Cup and ICC T20 Championship at Star, which we had in the comparable quarter last year and softer demand due to the effect of the demonetization as John mentioned, and the absence of American Idol at FBC which had its final run on Fox last year. But it's important to note that all but one of our U.S. cable brand saw good advertising growth with only the National Geographic Channel down which we expected due to our shift in programming strategy that Lachlan talked about earlier. National scatter remains strong, although local appears a little softer than we like particularly autos. For the month into the fourth quarter, we're looking for at least high single-digit growth for both our domestic and international cable portfolios. As for the distribution landscape a few highlights, domestically as John mentioned we saw affiliate income growth year-over-year about 8% and acceleration from the same period last year and from the last quarter as planned. We expect that growth to continue to accelerate in Q4 and into next year. The U.S. paid subscriber base for us was up slightly about 0.5% but obviously we some declines in the most widely distributed tiers of about 1.5% year-over-year which we have not seen accelerating since last quarter. In fact, everywhere we look we see a landscape of opportunity as downstream distribution becomes more innovative and competitive. Despite renewed market commentary over the last week's, we remain of the view that innovation and competition from new entrants and incumbent operators will ameliorate and then reverse the trends as digital rebundling drives overall universe growth. At Star we continue to grow at a good pace but the timing of some affiliate renewals last year affect this quarter's comparisons. You may recall that we had extraordinary growth last year in Q3 of some 20% in international cable affiliate revenue, so we are comping very nicely against a very high bar. This year we grew affiliate revenue in every key region with some of the pace at Fox Network Groups international channels slowing due to some local events such as the closure of two distributors in Thailand and some other weakness in Southeast Asia. And the Hotstar platform in India continues to make strides expanding its watch time over the prior year quarter by 220% making it by some estimates about 14 times the watch time for Netflix.  In Europe, Asia and Latin America we've introduced innovative nonlinear packages to each of their regions under the labels Fox Plus and Fox Premium all tailored for specific market and offering consumers more choice, a better experience and ultimately for us making a better business. And in the U.S. the digital MVPD revolution has only now reached the starting line. So taken all together, if we exclude the film segment which obviously didn't have a Deadpool in the quarter, revenue globally grew at about 11%. We think that's a pretty good clip and it's a testament to the diversity and breadth of the business geographically and by mix. And year-to-date our EBITDA is up 11% which underscores how all this comes together with a durable velocity underlying the business. I want to reiterate that our strategy to focus on big brands that matter for customers and investment on screen that clearly differentiates and earns attention and a program of work to make our programming and products more available not less is paying dividends. Our business has been an expression of the technological advances shaping our industry from way back from silent movies to talkies, from feature film exhibition to broadcast television and from broadcast to multichannel cable and satellite TV. And the underlying technological advances today ubiquitous high-speed connectivity, a continued proliferation of end user connected displays and the potential for unfettered access to creative assets in the cloud for customers globally presents an opportunity for accelerated growth for new and existing video creators and platforms. We think this is only just the beginning and the combination of strengths required to operate a high-volume content business and a vast international video platform is precisely the combination of strengths that we're developing. In short, if content is indeed King and using it to build platforms that are expression of these current underlying trends presents the most promising opportunity for our company in decades. Now before closing I like to quickly touch upon Sky. The business continues to deliver on its growth strategy recently reporting good financial performance with subscriber growth across the group. Last month we welcomed the decision by the European commission clearing unconditionally our proposed transaction. And we continue to work with U.K. regulators and were confident that the proposed transaction will be completed by the end of this calendar year as we said before. Thanks very much and were happy to take any questions you may have. Reed? Reed Nolte Thank you, James. Operator, well be happy to take questions from the investment community. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Michael Nathanson Thanks I have one for James. Given that you were the last major media company to report and we appreciate the update in your subscriber trends. No one yet ever has framed how big the virtual MVPD universe is currently. So could you tell us in aggregate how big virtual subs have been for you in the past quarter and what was the number a quarter ago so just give a sense of within your trends how much is the virtual MVPD business helping stabilize your cautious global trends? James Murdoch So first of all I dont want to get into disclosing sort of individual partners of ours kind of paid customer numbers, but I would say that it is very, very early days. And really I think mostly for us the think that I point out is number one, the inclusion of our core brands and the investment in those core brands that we've been making over the last couple of years has really worked in terms of inclusion in new virtual MVPDs in every major one all pretty much, all of our brands are there. And we see that growing pretty fast over the next number of quarters and years. But today which is a pretty small number because you really have really just DirecTV Now and Sling in the quarter and a little bit of Sony. But it's really now I think the increased competition YouTube launching after this quarter I think it was just in April and Hulu really just getting out of the gates last week. So it's really just early days there. So whats really driving this more is the fact that we've been investing in these brands and some of our brands are less mature. And we have continued growth in a number of our channels in terms of the existing traditional MVPD subscriber base as well. And I think actually one of our major brands saw any shrinkage in the quarter. John Nallen Michael Id add to what James said and James also touched upon on his prepared remarks. The pleasing thing from our point of view is how different all the emerging MVPDs are and theyre targeting different segments of our so the consumer audience. So between DirecTV Now and Sling TV, YouTube obviously Hulu, and PlayStation Vue they all very different services and we think this is incredibly important because not only are they designed - many of them are designed to replace traditional MVPDs subscriber numbers and losses but theyre targeting entirely new segments of U.S. households, segments that have broadband now but potentially dont have traditional MVPDs. So that's why it gives us a lot of confidence as James mentioned in his remarks that not only will these new services ameliorate decline in traditionally MVPDs but will actually grow the universe quite significantly over time. Reed Nolte Thank you, Michael. Operator, can we have the next question please. Operator Well go next to John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Janedis Thank you. One for John I think on the Cable Networks it was obviously a lot of movement on the cost front so as you look out I dont even the June quarter or beyond are there more sports rights costs or incremental investments we should be thinking about or are you entering more of a normalized out of the mid single type of growth going forward? John Nallen We'll see I'm only looking forward to the fourth quarter John but as I do well see kind of mid single on the domestic side which is the continued investment in Nat Geo and FX of the programming, but we don't have a big sports step up having domestically. But uniquely international we have a big cricket event in Star the Champion's Trophy. So we'll see a higher growth in that quarter uniquely for that event otherwise our expenses should be in that mid-single zone. John Janedis Thank you. Reed Nolte Thank you, John. Operator, can we have the next question please. Operator Next question is from Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead. Doug Mitchelson I was hoping some more detail on India James, I mean competitor highlighted yesterday that the Indian marketplace is challenging they were pleased at low exposure that obviously conflicts with your commentary and prepared remarks. Can you talk about the trajectory towards the long-term target of $1 billion of profitability and at what point Hotstar's cannibalistic and any other thoughts in the marketplace relative to that other point of view would be helpful probably? James Murdoch Look were very enthusiastic about our business in India. I think what were seeing there today as Lachlan mentioned an increase level of leadership in terms of our entertainment share. Our sports businesses is really going from strength to strength since we've acquired half of the ESPN STAR Sports joint venture number of years ago and really reinvented STAR Sports in the marketplace. It's been very, very successful not just in Cricket but also with Kabaddi and with the Indian Super League, the Soccer League there really rounding up the schedule. So we feel very good about it. I mean when look at the marketplace we obviously had a disruption with the demonetization and as John mentioned that's largely we largely through that now. It wasn't that big an impact in the last quarter and were at the run rate that we need to be at to get to our targets at this point. So we feel on target, we feel like the business is in pretty robust health creatively its performing very, very well and we feel confident about the overall the Indian environment generally. I did note some of those comments I heard about that and I was surprised because at least from our business perspective we take the view that you go into a market like India in the expectation that in success it's really going to change your life. So youre really don't go anything other than the whole hog and that has really paid off well. We have a very profitable an exciting business there and I think speaks to really the differentiation you're seeing across the media sector today. When I look at all that its very performance so I think I urged you to think about all of these firms have different strength and weaknesses. And our business has been on very clear path about investing in these big brands around the world, being global first, getting exposure to market that we think in success can really, really move the dial for us. And investing on screen for customers in a way that is committed to the best possible context experience they can have and maybe thats different from other players. Reed Nolte Thanks Doug. Operator, can we have the next question please. Operator We have a question from Jessica Reif with Bank of America. Please go ahead. In case we've lost Mr. Reif line one moment. We will go Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Anthony DiClemente I have two, one for James and one for John. James just wanted to ask about the appointment of Joe Marchese as the Head of Ad Sales I mean talk about the new model and kind of given his background in advanced advertising what is that appointment, and whats your thought process in appointing Joe say about your expectations or where the TV broadcast advertising model is going in terms of ad product. And then for John, you guys have really outperformed the market in terms of domestic affiliate revenue growth of course that's due to some recent large distributor renewals or at least one. So can you just talk a little bit more about the outlook for that? I mean I think James said in his prepared remarks, strong growth heading into '18. I think some folks are wondering about the second half of '18 after you kind of laughed at big renewal. And step up from that. So will other renewals help? Could you just remind us what portion of your footprint is up by that time that can perhaps pick you guys up despite the anniversary? Hope that make sense. Thanks. James Murdoch Thanks, Anthony. Well, I think on the advertising side, obviously when you have leadership changes and transitions you really look to what you think the needs of the business are going to be over time, and in the future. And I think in Joe and also in Danielle, Majid, also reporting to Randy in that area. Weve got leaders that are really very, very capable. And I think that the advanced advertising piece, combining now with the sort of core advertising sort of broader TV advertising piece, I think is just makes a lot of logical sense. We look at this business as an audience business and attention business. And having an organizational structure and the leaders of it aligned with that is the right strategy going forward and we're really excited about the next chapter for our domestic ad business. Lachlan, you want to add anything to that? Lachlan Murdoch Joe Marchese is an extraordinary executive. We're very lucky to have him driving our new advertising, advance advertising initiatives over the past couple of years. Hes going to do a tremendous job across all of our advertising sales portfolio. John Nallen Anthony, its John to deal with the second part, I got out of the guidance business a couple of years ago, but clearly, our domestic affiliate fee growth is strong and we look at the peers, and we are putting some real points on the board here. So we've accelerated this quarter. Were going to accelerate again next quarter and into '18. So if we get volume from the new virtual MVPD, then that's icing on the cake. So we're feeling very confident about our growth. Operator We have question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ben Swinburne Thank you. John, if you wouldnt mind just humoring - I just want to confirm. You were saying that '18 would accelerate from the fourth quarter level in '17. John Nallen Not necessarily saying that, Ben, but I was saying that from where we are in the third quarter, there's acceleration still ahead of us. Lachlan Murdoch By the way, I think it's something John has pointed to in the at least two or three earnings call. So I think the credibility of how closely we watch the affiliate revenue and growth, I think weve got a track record of delivering what we are. Ben Swinburne  And my bigger question is, Fox News has been a tremendous business for you guys. Obviously theres been a lot of change there and a lot of commentary in the press about advertisers showing some frustration and then youre coming back to the business. But Im wondering, affiliate fees are a huge part of that business model. I think its most of the revenue. Have you had any impact or conversations with distributors about some of the volatility there and the changes in talent and how youre feeling? I mean, the numbers sort of speak for themselves, but how are you feeling about that networks programming and position with distributors who are out there every day with consumers for that network? Lachlan Murdoch I think its interesting if you go on YouTube TV, for example, and you see the number one trending live challenge shows on emerging the MVPD, it's almost always the case, Fox News. And that continues obviously post lot of the programming changes in line that weve had. As we've said, the channel continues its ratings dominance. Move forward very strongly, very strong with both affiliates and with advertising sales. Were very confident in the future of that business. Ben Swinburne  Thank you, guys. Reed Nolte Operator, we think we have time for one last question. Operator  That comes from the line of Marci Ryvicke with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Marci Ryvicke Just curious about how you think of the TV station business with the Blackstone JV, you are bidding for Tribune, and you may not have bid Tribune, maybe youre going back to bid Tribune. We're just curious how your distribution strategy may have changed. James Murdoch So first of all, look what I don't think is - I think this is not a forum to get into hypothetical conversations around M&A that may or may not have happened. I would say that in the end we didn't bid for Tribune, we talked about this with investment community and our shareholders in the past, the station business is a strong business for us, it's an important part of our network distribution, it's a strong business in terms of local programming, local news and so on. But it isn't a place that we're targeting to deploy capital into and so anything that we look at there is more about, can we change our strategic position, could we think about scale in a different way but not in a way that would be - not in way that would be a use of capital for us at all just to be clear. But it remains - look its a strong business and I think the local - relevant to those local bands and the local stations in their communities continues to be very high. Marci Ryvicke Do you feel that the leverage maybe shifting to stations does that get bigger, do you worry about that? James Murdoch Look I think our affiliate agreements are constantly something that we think about and adjust. They come up in different cycles and we feel that we have quite a lot of options with respect to the working with our partners. Tribune is obviously a big partner of ours and we look forward to continuing to work with them. We provide an enormous value for our affiliate partners as they do for us. So we think it's a pretty balance relationship and one that we strive to make fair. Lachlan Murdoch I think thats exactly right. When you're speaking of retransmission consent in particular, obviously the value of the network programming in particular sport is incredibly important part of that relationship with the affiliates and what they can achieve through their retransmission consent. James Murdoch I think that's all were going to have time for folks. So much appreciate everyone joining the call and thanks very much for your time.

So could you tell us in aggregate how big virtual subs have been for you in the past quarter and what was the number a quarter ago so just give a sense of within your trends how much is the virtual MVPD business helping stabilize your cautious global trends? James Murdoch So first of all I dont want to get into disclosing sort of individual partners of ours kind of paid customer numbers, but I would say that it is very, very early days. And really I think mostly for us the think that I point out is number one, the inclusion of our core brands and the investment in those core brands that we've been making over the last couple of years has really worked in terms of inclusion in new virtual MVPDs in every major one all pretty much, all of our brands are there. And we see that growing pretty fast over the next number of quarters and years. But today which is a pretty small number because you really have really just DirecTV Now and Sling in the quarter and a little bit of Sony. But it's really now I think the increased competition YouTube launching after this quarter I think it was just in April and Hulu really just getting out of the gates last week. So it's really just early days there. So whats really driving this more is the fact that we've been investing in these brands and some of our brands are less mature. And we have continued growth in a number of our channels in terms of the existing traditional MVPD subscriber base as well. And I think actually one of our major brands saw any shrinkage in the quarter. John Nallen Michael Id add to what James said and James also touched upon on his prepared remarks. The pleasing thing from our point of view is how different all the emerging MVPDs are and theyre targeting different segments of our so the consumer audience. So between DirecTV Now and Sling TV, YouTube obviously Hulu, and PlayStation Vue they all very different services and we think this is incredibly important because not only are they designed - many of them are designed to replace traditional MVPDs subscriber numbers and losses but theyre targeting entirely new segments of U.S. households, segments that have broadband now but potentially dont have traditional MVPDs. So that's why it gives us a lot of confidence as James mentioned in his remarks that not only will these new services ameliorate decline in traditionally MVPDs but will actually grow the universe quite significantly over time. Reed Nolte Thank you, Michael. Operator, can we have the next question please. Operator Well go next to John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Janedis Thank you. One for John I think on the Cable Networks it was obviously a lot of movement on the cost front so as you look out I dont even the June quarter or beyond are there more sports rights costs or incremental investments we should be thinking about or are you entering more of a normalized out of the mid single type of growth going forward? John Nallen We'll see I'm only looking forward to the fourth quarter John but as I do well see kind of mid single on the domestic side which is the continued investment in Nat Geo and FX of the programming, but we don't have a big sports step up having domestically. But uniquely international we have a big cricket event in Star the Champion's Trophy. So we'll see a higher growth in that quarter uniquely for that event otherwise our expenses should be in that mid-single zone. John Janedis Thank you. Reed Nolte Thank you, John. Operator, can we have the next question please. Operator Next question is from Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead. Doug Mitchelson I was hoping some more detail on India James, I mean competitor highlighted yesterday that the Indian marketplace is challenging they were pleased at low exposure that obviously conflicts with your commentary and prepared remarks. Can you talk about the trajectory towards the long-term target of $1 billion of profitability and at what point Hotstar's cannibalistic and any other thoughts in the marketplace relative to that other point of view would be helpful probably? James Murdoch Look were very enthusiastic about our business in India. I think what were seeing there today as Lachlan mentioned an increase level of leadership in terms of our entertainment share. Our sports businesses is really going from strength to strength since we've acquired half of the ESPN STAR Sports joint venture number of years ago and really reinvented STAR Sports in the marketplace. It's been very, very successful not just in Cricket but also with Kabaddi and with the Indian Super League, the Soccer League there really rounding up the schedule. So we feel very good about it. I mean when look at the marketplace we obviously had a disruption with the demonetization and as John mentioned that's largely we largely through that now. It wasn't that big an impact in the last quarter and were at the run rate that we need to be at to get to our targets at this point. So we feel on target, we feel like the business is in pretty robust health creatively its performing very, very well and we feel confident about the overall the Indian environment generally. I did note some of those comments I heard about that and I was surprised because at least from our business perspective we take the view that you go into a market like India in the expectation that in success it's really going to change your life. So youre really don't go anything other than the whole hog and that has really paid off well. We have a very profitable an exciting business there and I think speaks to really the differentiation you're seeing across the media sector today. When I look at all that its very performance so I think I urged you to think about all of these firms have different strength and weaknesses. And our business has been on very clear path about investing in these big brands around the world, being global first, getting exposure to market that we think in success can really, really move the dial for us. And investing on screen for customers in a way that is committed to the best possible context experience they can have and maybe thats different from other players. Reed Nolte Thanks Doug. Operator, can we have the next question please. Operator We have a question from Jessica Reif with Bank of America. Please go ahead. In case we've lost Mr. Reif line one moment. We will go Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Anthony DiClemente I have two, one for James and one for John. James just wanted to ask about the appointment of Joe Marchese as the Head of Ad Sales I mean talk about the new model and kind of given his background in advanced advertising what is that appointment, and whats your thought process in appointing Joe say about your expectations or where the TV broadcast advertising model is going in terms of ad product. And then for John, you guys have really outperformed the market in terms of domestic affiliate revenue growth of course that's due to some recent large distributor renewals or at least one. So can you just talk a little bit more about the outlook for that? I mean I think James said in his prepared remarks, strong growth heading into '18. I think some folks are wondering about the second half of '18 after you kind of laughed at big renewal. And step up from that. So will other renewals help? Could you just remind us what portion of your footprint is up by that time that can perhaps pick you guys up despite the anniversary? Hope that make sense. Thanks. James Murdoch Thanks, Anthony. Well, I think on the advertising side, obviously when you have leadership changes and transitions you really look to what you think the needs of the business are going to be over time, and in the future. And I think in Joe and also in Danielle, Majid, also reporting to Randy in that area. Weve got leaders that are really very, very capable. And I think that the advanced advertising piece, combining now with the sort of core advertising sort of broader TV advertising piece, I think is just makes a lot of logical sense. We look at this business as an audience business and attention business. And having an organizational structure and the leaders of it aligned with that is the right strategy going forward and we're really excited about the next chapter for our domestic ad business. Lachlan, you want to add anything to that? Lachlan Murdoch Joe Marchese is an extraordinary executive. We're very lucky to have him driving our new advertising, advance advertising initiatives over the past couple of years. Hes going to do a tremendous job across all of our advertising sales portfolio. John Nallen Anthony, its John to deal with the second part, I got out of the guidance business a couple of years ago, but clearly, our domestic affiliate fee growth is strong and we look at the peers, and we are putting some real points on the board here. So we've accelerated this quarter. Were going to accelerate again next quarter and into '18. So if we get volume from the new virtual MVPD, then that's icing on the cake. So we're feeling very confident about our growth. Operator We have question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ben Swinburne Thank you. John, if you wouldnt mind just humoring - I just want to confirm. You were saying that '18 would accelerate from the fourth quarter level in '17. John Nallen Not necessarily saying that, Ben, but I was saying that from where we are in the third quarter, there's acceleration still ahead of us. Lachlan Murdoch By the way, I think it's something John has pointed to in the at least two or three earnings call. So I think the credibility of how closely we watch the affiliate revenue and growth, I think weve got a track record of delivering what we are. Ben Swinburne  And my bigger question is, Fox News has been a tremendous business for you guys. Obviously theres been a lot of change there and a lot of commentary in the press about advertisers showing some frustration and then youre coming back to the business. But Im wondering, affiliate fees are a huge part of that business model. I think its most of the revenue. Have you had any impact or conversations with distributors about some of the volatility there and the changes in talent and how youre feeling? I mean, the numbers sort of speak for themselves, but how are you feeling about that networks programming and position with distributors who are out there every day with consumers for that network? Lachlan Murdoch I think its interesting if you go on YouTube TV, for example, and you see the number one trending live challenge shows on emerging the MVPD, it's almost always the case, Fox News. And that continues obviously post lot of the programming changes in line that weve had. As we've said, the channel continues its ratings dominance. Move forward very strongly, very strong with both affiliates and with advertising sales. Were very confident in the future of that business. Ben Swinburne  Thank you, guys. Reed Nolte Operator, we think we have time for one last question. Operator  That comes from the line of Marci Ryvicke with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Marci Ryvicke Just curious about how you think of the TV station business with the Blackstone JV, you are bidding for Tribune, and you may not have bid Tribune, maybe youre going back to bid Tribune. We're just curious how your distribution strategy may have changed. James Murdoch So first of all, look what I don't think is - I think this is not a forum to get into hypothetical conversations around M&A that may or may not have happened. I would say that in the end we didn't bid for Tribune, we talked about this with investment community and our shareholders in the past, the station business is a strong business for us, it's an important part of our network distribution, it's a strong business in terms of local programming, local news and so on. But it isn't a place that we're targeting to deploy capital into and so anything that we look at there is more about, can we change our strategic position, could we think about scale in a different way but not in a way that would be - not in way that would be a use of capital for us at all just to be clear. But it remains - look its a strong business and I think the local - relevant to those local bands and the local stations in their communities continues to be very high. Marci Ryvicke Do you feel that the leverage maybe shifting to stations does that get bigger, do you worry about that? James Murdoch Look I think our affiliate agreements are constantly something that we think about and adjust. They come up in different cycles and we feel that we have quite a lot of options with respect to the working with our partners. Tribune is obviously a big partner of ours and we look forward to continuing to work with them. We provide an enormous value for our affiliate partners as they do for us. So we think it's a pretty balance relationship and one that we strive to make fair. Lachlan Murdoch I think thats exactly right. When you're speaking of retransmission consent in particular, obviously the value of the network programming in particular sport is incredibly important part of that relationship with the affiliates and what they can achieve through their retransmission consent. James Murdoch I think that's all were going to have time for folks. So much appreciate everyone joining the call and thanks very much for your time.

Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Arthur Su - Needham & Company, LLC Operator Good day, everyone, and welcome to First Solar's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Stephen Haymore - First Solar, Inc. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2017 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business and technology update, then Alex will discuss our first quarter financial results and provide updated guidance for 2017. We will then open up the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In the few cases where we report non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income or non-GAAP EPS, we have reconciled the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures at the back of our presentation. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call today. I'll begin by briefly reviewing our results for the first quarter, before providing an update on our Series 6 progress and developments in our business. Our first quarter results were a good start to the year with the sale of our Moapa project closing and receipt of the remaining cash from the transaction. Our non-GAAP EPS of $0.25 was above our guidance, which is a noteworthy accomplishment in a very challenging market environment. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in net cash, which further differentiates the strength of our balance sheet from our competitors, as we remain true to our balanced business model philosophy of growth, profitability and liquidity. Alex will provide more color on our financial results later in his remarks. As indicated on our last earnings call, we are carefully planning all aspects of the Series 6 launch to ensure both technological and commercial readiness. On our last call, we focused on the technology. Today, we will provide an update on our commercial preparation to ensure a successful market launch of our Series 6 product. Keep in mind that with over 17 gigawatts of modules produced, First Solar's technology is well understood and has been installed in projects worldwide. Our customers have trust in our technology, product quality and financial strength. However, given the change in the module form factor, as we move to Series 6, we are making the necessary preparations to ensure a smooth product launch. Turning to slide 4. I'll discuss some of our commercial readiness efforts. Firstly, as it relates to enabling the ecosystem around Series 6, our primary goal is to ensure our cost-effective compatibility with our customers preferred structure providers. Since we made the decision last year to accelerate our Series 6 product, we have been collaborating with leading domestic and global structure providers, EPC contractors and PV engineering firms to evaluate and optimize the Series 6 mounting interface for a wide variety of applications. The learnings from this collaboration, coupled with the module height that is the same as the 72 cell crystalline silicon module and a module frame that facilitates rapid installation gives us confidence in the competitive installation cost of our Series 6 product. We've also been evaluating the mechanical design and installation features of our Series 6 models at our Mesa, Arizona test site, where we've installed more than half a dozen structures from leading suppliers. A third-party contractor has completed trial installations of Series 6 prototypes and the various structure types, including side-by-side trials with competing 72 cell crystalline silicon modes. We've been careful analyzing various installation means and methods focused on optimizing installation velocity and minimizing labor hours. The initial results from this work are very positive and indicate that Series 6 is compatible with existing leading structure designs and can be expected to have favorable installation hours per megawatt installed versus 72 cell crystalline silicon models. Beyond our efforts to ensure a seamless mechanical integration of Series 6, we're also validating the electrical BOS design elements. We have been carefully listing to the voice of our ecosystem partners, understanding their needs and incorporating their feedback to ensure the most efficient designs at a lowest possible cost. To validate our internal electrical BOS analysis and testing, we've engaged two independent engineering firms to provide their assessment of the expected cost of Series 6 electrical BOS components and associated labor. In both case, the independent analysis supports our internal projections. The analysis also supports our belief that due to a shorter string length, Series 6 provides greater layout optimization and siting flexibility. In addition to our own analysis, third-party EPCs and customers have been viewing Series 6 installation demonstrations at the Mesa test site as they develop their own assessment of the installation process and costs. EPC have also begun conducting their own installation trials at the Mesa site to gain hands-on experience and increased familiarity with Series 6. Based on their evaluation and analysis, several EPCs have already provided quotes that further support that Series 6 BOS cost is expected to be similar to or better than competing crystalline silicon products. Over the next few months, we're expanding these trials to several international locations, which will provide greater access to international EPCs and will help ensure that Series 6 is supported by a cost-efficient, mechanical, electrical and EPC ecosystem in all key global markets. As highlighted on slide 5, engaging directly with our customers to both educate them on Series 6 and to solicit their feedback on the product is among our highest priorities. With these objectives in mind, we have recently hosted more than 100 of our customers at a conference in Arizona that included attendance from leading IPPs, developers, utilities, EPCs and ecosystem partners. Customers will provide an early product information and have the opportunity to attend demonstrations of Series 6 module prototype installations. Customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive with over 95% of our customers indicating they were likely to purchase Series 6. These are positive first steps, and while there's still more work to be done, especially internationally, we are pleased with how Series 6 has been embraced by our customers. In short, the testing performed with our ecosystem partners and voice of the customer feedback received have reinforced our view that Series 6 eliminates the balance of system cost disadvantages associated with our smaller form factors Series 4 module. Our module technology will now be able to leverage its advantaged attributes, including superior temperature coefficient and spectral response unencumbered by higher balance of system cost. Turning to slide six, I'll provide a brief update on our Series 6 technology and manufacturing milestones. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the progress we are making on the Series 6 technology and manufacturing platform. Since our last earnings call, we have ramped down production on eight lines or approximately one-third of our Series 4 manufacturing out of Malaysia factory. This timing aligns with the milestones that we've provided in our February call. The space is undergoing preparation for the delivery of Series 6 equipment, which is scheduled later this year. In addition, we now have all of the production tools ordered for Ohio in our first Malaysia factory. Over the next major  our next major milestone, the arrival in the third quarter of 2017 of our first tools to our Ohio factory remains on track. We will provide further updates on our Q2 earnings call. Turning to slide seven, I'll provide an update on our future expected module shipments. From the time of our last earnings call, approximately nine weeks ago, we have booked over 100 megawatts of third-party module sales, bringing our total year-to-date bookings to nearly 600 megawatts DC. The geographical mix of our recent module bookings is primarily Asia Pacific and Europe. After deducting year-to-date shipments through March of approximately 400 megawatts, our remaining expected shipments now stand at 3 gigawatts DC. On slide eight, we've provided an updated view of our remaining Series 4 supply. As indicated previously, our remaining Series 4 supply will range between 3.6 and 3.8 gigawatts depending on when we see Series 4 production at our Ohio plant. We will continue to evaluate this decision over the course of the year. Of the anticipated 3.6 to 3.8 gigawatts of Series 4 supply across 2017 and 2018, we have already shipped approximately 400 megawatts, and we have an additional 1.5 gigawatts of volume on the contract, leaving us with the remaining supply of between 1.7 and 1.9 gigawatts. Relative to the prior quarter and based on updated construction schedules, we have reduced the allocation of Series 4 supply to our own capital development projects by approximately 200 megawatts. This is a result of a shift in module allocation to Series 6 uncertain of our captive projects. This decision is expected to result in meaningful improvement in the overall gross margin of these projects. While the pace of our bookings over the past two months is slower than the start of the year, we are encouraged by the growth in our mid to late-stage bookings opportunities shown on slide nine. Since our last earnings call, bookings opportunity have grown to 3 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 800 megawatts. Roughly two-thirds of the total 3 gigawatts of opportunities are for Series 4 shipments. Notably, of the approximately 2 gigawatts of Series 4 opportunities, there are approximately 1 gigawatt of projects that are in late stage negotiations. In some cases, we have signed module supply agreements, but are waiting for other conditions precedent, including project financial close, our letter of credit, before recognizing these bookings. We expect much of this volume to book in the second and third quarter. Given the status of these projects and the other mid- to late-stage opportunities, we feel that we're in a good position to sell through the remaining Series 4 supply. In addition, we have a much larger number of early-stage opportunities not included in this view, which helps increase our confidence. Lastly, as we announced recently, we are evaluating alternatives for the sale of our interest at 8point3. This is a result of several factors. Firstly, in the future, we anticipate selling projects primarily in the U.S. prior to COD. As the solar industry has matured, the impact of project value of selling to FNTP or shortly thereafter versus that COD is de minimis. In fact, in some cases, value is enhanced with an earlier sale as this allows the buyer greater degrees of freedom to optimize the structuring of tax equity and project debt. Secondly, recycling capital more quickly allows us to potentially invest in more project development opportunities. As we do this, we remain focused on our targeted development markets where we see the most opportunity. Finally, we remain focused on Series 6 and prioritizing investments in Series 6 manufacturing capacity, which we believe has the potential to provide a high return on invested capital. As we continuously evaluate our business model, these important considerations led us to determination to explore strategic alternatives for the sale of our interest in 8point3. Alex will now provide more detail on our first quarter 2017 financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2017. Alex? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. Thanks, Mark. So beginning on slide 11, I'll touch briefly on the operational results of our Series 4 product in the past quarter. Module production was 712 megawatts DC in the first quarter, a decrease of 6% from the prior quarter due to nearly a full quarter of stopped production on four lines in Ohio that began ramping down late last year to prepare the Series 6 production. Capacity utilization increased to 98% in Q1 versus 92% in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter utilization was lower as it included the four lines that were ramped down. Note that as we ramp down Series 4 production, the utilization metric will be subject to increased fluctuation and therefore, somewhat less meaningful. In part, this is why we introduced the remaining Series 4 supply metric, which provides a more relevant metric during the ramp down. Module conversion efficiency for the full fleet averaged 16.7% in the first quarter, an increase of 10 basis points versus Q4 2016. Conversion efficiency on our best line for the full quarter improved 10 basis points to 16.9% as compared to the prior quarter. Our best line exited the third quarter at over 17%. Continuing to slide 12, I'll review some of the income statement highlights for Q1 2017. In reviewing our income statement results, I'll also be discussing certain non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the accompanying GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Additionally, we've elected earlier to adopt ASU 2014-09, the new revenue standard, which provides common revenue recognition guidance between GAAP and IFRS. The adoption of the standard generally requires us to recognize revenue and profit from our systems business sales in a more linear fashion in our historical practice. Our previously reported financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this standard adoption and more information is available in our press release and in our pending 10-Q filing. In reviewing our financial results, comparisons to the fourth quarter will reflect any applicable revisions from this change. Net sales were $892 million, an increase of $561 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase in net sales resulted primarily from the sale of the Moapa projects with the entire revenue from the project recognized in the quarter. Higher revenue from the Moapa sale was partially offset by $179 million decrease in module sales. The closing of the Moapa sale is a significant milestone given the size and complexity of the project and it's also an important component of our 2017 guidance. As a percentage of total quarterly net sales of solar power systems revenue which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects increased to 92% from 25% in Q4 as a result of the Moapa sale and lower third-party module sales. Gross margin for the first quarter was 9% compared to 2% in the prior quarter. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily a result of project impairment in Q4. To put the Q1 gross margin in context, keep in mind that our prior comments on the Moapa project that was acquired in late-stage development. We, therefore, paid a significant development premium for the project. As a result of this and certain developments and construction challenges specific to the project, the gross margin of the project is not representative of what we would expect from a typical development project sale. The gross margin of our component segment was 26% in Q1 compared to 13% in the prior quarter. The sequential increase here was primarily due to the impact of certain charges associated with our project impairments in Q4. Operating expenses excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges was $72 million in the first quarter versus Q4 adjusted OpEx of $100 million. $28 million sequential decrease as a result of the impact of our previously implemented restructuring actions and also an $8 million decrease in project impairment charges. Restructuring and asset impairment charges to accelerate our Series 6 transition were $20 million in Q1 compared to $729 million in the prior quarter. The charge relates to Series 4 and Series 5 equipments and severance related to the ramp down of certain Series 4 production lines. Excluding restructuring-related items, operating income in the first quarter was $12 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $90 million in Q4. The increase in adjusted operating income is primarily due to higher sales, lower project impairment charges and a decrease in operating expenses. On a GAAP basis, our operating loss for the quarter was $8 million. Other income for the quarter was $26 million, primarily resulting from the settlement of an outstanding matter with a former customer. The cash associated with the settlement was also received in Q1. We had tax expense of $6 million in the first quarter compared to $56 million of tax expense in Q4. As a reminder, the prior quarter tax expense is significantly higher due to predominantly non-cash tax expense of $196 million, associated with the distribution of approximately $750 million of cash to the U.S. from a foreign subsidiary. The prior quarter tax expense was partially offset by a tax benefit from restructuring charges. First quarter EPS was $0.09 on a GAAP basis and excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, $0.25 on a non-GAAP basis. Relative to our expectations to Q1, EPS was higher due to better-than-expected profit from the Moapa project sale and the timing of a settlement of the former customer, which was not expected in Q1. In addition, this settlement was contemplated on our previous guidance to potentially benefit operating income rather than other income. I'll next discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information on slide 13. Our cash and multiple securities balance ended the first quarter at over $2.4 billion, an increase of approximately $491 million from Q4. Our net cash position improved by $402 million to nearly $2.2 billion as we received the final payments for our Moapa and East Pecos project. Our Q1 net working capital, which includes the change in non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities, decreased by $374 million. The change was primarily due to a net reduction in projects assets and deferred revenue from the sale of the Moapa project. Total debt was $277 million in the first quarter, an increase of $89 million from the prior quarter. The increase mainly resulted from issuing non-recourse project level debt for projects in Japan, India and Australia. Cash flows from operations were $493 million in Q1 versus cash flows from operations of $268 million in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow was $380 million compared to free cash flow of $215 million last quarter. Capital expenditures were $113 million compared to $54 million in the prior quarter. Turning to Slide 14, I'll review updated full year 2017 guidance. In terms of assumptions underlying our guidance, as we indicated last quarter, the adoption of new revenue standards not have a significant impact on the net sales range we've already provided. However, as mentioned previously and I've seen with the updates in that sales guidance in our previous call associated with structuring of the Moapa project, the final structuring of project sales later this year may have future impact to our net sales guidance. As it relates to project sales during the remainder of the year, we're pleased with the progress of making the sale of 179 megawatts AC Switch Station Project. We're in advanced stage of the sale process and expect to close the transaction in Q2 or Q3 of this year. The California Flats and Cuyama projects have been offered to 8point3 and are under review by the partnership. If 8point3 is not able to acquire these projects, we anticipate having sufficient third-party demand to sell these projects this year. Turning now to the guidance ranges. As a result of improved visibility in the certain project sales, we are raising our net sales guidance by $50 million to a revised range of $2.85 billion to $2.95 billion. We're raising our gross margin percentage of 150 basis points to a revised range of 12.5% to 14.5% as a result of the improved operational performance, better project sale visibility and as a result of the movement of certain expenses previously forecast as cost of sales, which are now expected to be treated as plant startup costs within operating expense. Our OpEx guidance increased by $40 million for both GAAP and non-GAAP, as a result of the revised plant startup previously mentioned. For GAAP operating expenses, this $40 million increase was partially offset by a $15 million decrease in expected restructuring and asset impairment charges. The revised restructuring range is now $40 million to $65 million, of which $20 million was incurred in the first quarter. The downward revision to the range resulted from ongoing supply negotiations, which reduce the potential remaining liability. We're raising our EPS guidance by $0.25 based on our operational performance and in anticipation of better economic value from certain project sales. Our revised non-GAAP EPS range is now $0.25 to $0.75 and our GAAP EPS range has been revised to a loss of $0.30, up to $0.40 a profit. The change in GAAP EPS is a result both of the fact as leading to the increase in the non-GAAP EPS, combined with lower expected restructuring charges. Note that our guidance includes expected net interest expense of $15 million to $20 million and minimal contribution from equity and earnings. We also anticipate minimal other income or expense for the balance of the year. In terms of a quarterly distribution of our non-GAAP earnings, we currently expect second quarter earnings to be approximately breakeven. However, the timing of the sale of the Switch Station Project, currently forecasted in Q3 could materially increase second quarter earnings. We have previously anticipated a loss in the first half of the year. However, our operational performance including improved module cost per watt and improving outlook for the system sale business have resulted in a change to our outlook. As it relates to our guidance for certain catalyst that may lead us to further raise our EPS expectations for the remainder of the year, including further improved visibility into sales system projects. Additionally, as part of our ongoing tax funding assets, we may record an income tax benefit of up to $55 million (24:06) in the second quarter. As this benefit is still subject to acceptance by tax authorities, we have not yet incorporated this into our guidance and will do so when and to the extent the matter is finalized. Related to our net cash and operating cash flow guidance, our expected ranges of both increased by $100 million. The increase is a combination of higher revenue, improved module cost per watt, improved systems business margins, improved working capital management and lower restructuring charges. I'll now summarize our first quarter 2017 progress on slide 15. We had solid financial results for the quarter. Net sales of $892 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.25. Our ending cash was over $2.4 billion with $2.2 billion of net cash. We raised the midpoint of our GAAP EPS by nearly $0.50 and our non-GAAP EPS by $0.25. Our Series 4 module efficiency remains solid with a fleet full average of 16.7%, a lead line efficiency of 16.9% in Q1. Our outlook for 2017 bookings is strong, with nearly 600 megawatts booked here to date and mid- to late-stage opportunities of 3 gigawatts. Our Series 6 transition is progressing well, and we're making the necessary preparations to ensure a successful product launch. We have now ordered all of the tools for both our Ohio and Malaysia factories. In addition, the first Series 6 tools are on track to arrive at our Ohio factory in Q3. And lastly, we're pleased with the positive response from our customers and ecosystem partners to the Series 6 products. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator And we will take our first one from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, if you assume the 8point3 strategic process results in more capital to deploy, I know that's an assumption at this point, but how should we be thinking about priorities? Are you looking to fast-track Series 6? Do you build more capacity than the current base case or would it be something else? Just trying to get a sense for what the uses of capital would be, and then I have a follow-up. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. Yeah, so Brian, clearly the liquidity position is strong today. And we've made a strategic decision to maintain both an unlevered balance sheet and a net cash position given cyclicality in the solar industry. The business is in a transition period between Series 4 and Series 6, which is capital-intensive, and we intend to grow that Series 6 capacity from a position of strength. So in terms of how we think about capital, we really look to award full of cash needs and opportunities. So firstly, we fund our operations; secondly, we look to invest in manufacturing capacity that's both the current Series 6 announced capacity and then the ability to grow beyond that as the more opportunity presents. We look to fund the development business, and that includes long-term systems opportunities relative  that provides incremental returns relative to the module business and relative to the risk-adjusted cost of capital associated with those projects. After that, we look at M&A, and that's post the sale of existing assets, investments, and also opportunities to invest in other growth opportunities, so we continue to look at synergistic M&A opportunities, both around the technology and around project development. And then finally on top of that, we make sure we have an adequate buffer to provide liquidity through cyclicality in the industry volatility. So once you go through all of those, we look to prioritize our capital and see where we can use it. Assuming at that point, we had excess capital which we didn't leave could be accretively deployed in business then we look to return that capital to shareholders. So that's an ongoing analysis. And we'll obviously continue to monitor the capital and liquidity position as we move through the Series 6 transition and through other events this year, including the sale of 8point3 and the systems business sales. The other thing that we take into account is, geographically, about half of our cash sits offshore and is subsequently invested offshore. Should we have any tax reform or anything else that impacts the ability to use that cash, that would obviously play into the calculation as well. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay, okay, great, fair enough. Appreciate the color. Second question, I guess, this is, obviously, kind of front-and-center topic. I'm sure there's going to be a number of questions around this. But can you guys speak to the Section 201 request from one of your manufacturing peers in the U.S.? I guess, I'd be curious to know if it's impacting your approach to booking, the remaining Series 4 capacity you outlined? And then with respect to Series 6, and then if your current contracted bookings have any contingencies that would allow for pricing to be recalibrated? And then lastly, with respect to Series 6, how this potentially factors into your thinking around timing, investment and then just the general strategy there? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. All right, Brian, there's a lot there, so I'll try to  hopefully I got most of your questions. First off, as it relates to the Tier 1 case, we're obviously very aware of it. We're looking closely at the filing. Clearly, I think the spirit of the reason for the filing is rooted in the fact that there's clearly an oversupply in this industry, and we believe that really is an issue. And we also believe that there is a need for free and fair trade, and there's also a need for enforcement around that. So all that I think provides a undertone of the merits of what the case relates to. As you also know that thin-film is not included. It's not included in the criteria of the basis of what the case is currently structured for, which would exclude not only our production here, obviously, in the U.S., but, obviously, our production outside of the U.S., currently in Malaysia and then ultimately, into Vietnam. As it relates to our strategy, we're going to continue to move forward, we're going to continue to address the market, we're going to continue to provide high value to our customers in the best possible product in the marketplace, whether it's Series 4 or whether it's Series 6. We'll enter into our contracts, a lot of the obligations that are in those contracts, we are not structuring contracts for the most part that would enable some form of a repricing. But if the case were to creates some merit, and if we now have, again, a different view of where the market (30:40) price is for crystalline silicon, that could inform our views a little bit around how we think about our pricing strategy for both Series 4 and Series 6, but that's clearly off into the future. As it relates to our view around manufacturing capacity and where we think about Series 6, our commitments still is the priorities that we talked about before for Perrysburg, then Malaysia and then Vietnam. We've also highlighted though that we have flexibility in the toolset that we're currently installing in Ohio, that could allow us some optionality of increasing capacity of Series 6 in Perrysburg, and we'd look to this maybe as one factor that would inform our decision around that. The other would be, I'd argue that corporate tax rate would be another one that would inform our  U.S. corporate tax rate would inform our view around adding incremental capacity into our facility in Ohio. So there's a lot of moving pieces we're going to continue to assess and evaluate. And again, I think the whole fundamental issue though that we shall be focused on is, we're very happy with where we are with our launch of Series 6, that's in great position. This trade case or other issues that may arise from it may also inform our view of little bit around how long we continue to produce in Perrysburg. We've highlighted that our current view is we've optionality of maybe pulling a couple of hundred megawatts out, which really is there to facilitate the transition into Series 6 to the extent there is some traction around this case, we may continue to produce that 200 megawatt, maybe not only through 2018, but beyond 2018, if need may be. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. Brian, with regards to Series 6 timing, we're already on a pretty aggressive schedule there, so I don't see that changes. As Mark said, we have flexibility around the Series 4 supply to keep that going longer should we need it. Operator And we'll take our next question from Philip Shen of ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC Hi. Thanks for the questions. As a follow-up on the Section 201 topic. If the Section 201 gets implemented, do you see any changes to your production plans for 2018. For example, would you move to produce either more or less of Series 4 or Series 6 than you had previously indicated? And could you sell the Series 6 externally in 2018 versus prior plans of keeping, I believe, most of it in-house? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. Phil, I think I sort of alluded to a little bit in my comments to Brian's question, but it really did  other than the timing of when we would actually wind down our production of Series 4 in Perrysburg, it really doesn't inform our views beyond that in 2018. Now if the trade case were to get some traction, could we look to continue producing some Series 4 in Perrysburg as an example, potentially? Again, the other thing, but again, it's a longer date of horizon depending on what happens with this case. We have the optionality of adding incremental capacity in Perrysburg if need be. Again, the toolset accommodates production volume that is closer to 1.1 gigawatts versus the currently planned 550 megawatts, so a lot there to be evaluated. But I think we're very early. I mean, obviously, as you know the trade case was just filed here recently. A lot will happen and evolve over the next months and quarters, and as we get a clear picture of what direction it's going, we have options and decisions that will make at that point in time. Operator And we will take our next question from Krish Sankar of Bank of America. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, if the California Flats and Moapa projects do get sold to 8point3 or a third party, is that in your forecast for this year? A  [06G0M8-E Mark Widmar]>: So the Moapa project has already been completed, and that's in the Q1 revenue. The California Flats project is assumed to be sold this year. Now whether it goes to 8point3 or to another third party, it is going to dependent on 8point3's appetite ability to acquire that project. So the partnership and 8point3 is currently reviewing that asset. The indication I would given the capital requirements to acquire that, 8point3 is likely not going to do so. But if that's the case, we're going to sell it to a third party, but the value of that project is in our guidance for the year, timing remains a little uncertain. The other project that is in that perhaps you're thinking of this is a switch project, so that's in our numbers for the year and we're assuming comes in Q3 although there is a chance that could accelerate into Q2. Operator And our next question comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. So I have two questions. One is can you just clarify the comments you made on production output of Series 6 in 2018? Do you say 550 megawatts or could it be up to a 1 gigawatt of output in 2018? And then as far as the cash balance is concerned, I think you had previously said that your cash distribution is going to -net cash could go down until Q1, Q2 of next year. Is that still the case? Or do you expect cash to improve over the next couple of quarters? Thank you. A  [06G0M8-E Mark Widmar]>: On the Series 6 production, let makes sure, I'm clear on that, and I'll let Alex to take the cash question. But Series 6 what I had  what the 550 megawatts represented, 550 megawatts is the fully ramp capacity that we're currently are planning in our Perrysburg facility, all right. And we won't actually start producing in Perrysburg until the middle of next year, so we won't have a full year output from Perrysburg. But in aggregate across Perrysburg, across KLM, for example, our Malaysia facility, we anticipate to have a little bit north of around 1 gigawatts, maybe a little bit north of a gigawatt production of Series 6 in 2018. Again, with that all that production largely happening in the second half of 2018. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. Yes, on the cash side, so we raised on net cash guidance by $100 million, so $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion for the end of this year, and that's including the CapEx we're planning on spending for the year. So $525 million to $625 million, of which we spent a little over $100 million in the first quarter. So we're on track on the CapEx side. The cash balance for the end of the year will go up slightly relative to previous guidance. We haven't guided to be on that, but we will continue to spend CapEx through to 2018. And as we've mentioned before, 2018, when we started with Series 4 product in Q1 and Q2, it's the time that product is going to be most challenged relative to the competition given that we're no longer investing in the development of Series 4 as we focus on Series 6. So we haven't guided out to a number, but we would expect to continue to spend CapEx all the Series 6 transition through 2018, but we're, obviously, going to end the year with a very robust cash balance, and the cash guidance that number we're giving here through the end of the year doesn't include any proceeds from 8point3. Operator And we will take our next question from Andrew Hughes of Credit Suisse. Andrew Hughes - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Congrats on the quarter. I had a question on Moapa and guidance and then one of tax equity, if you don't mind. Just on the Moapa result, can you give us a sense of what drove better margins? Was it pricing or more of the internal transfer costs? And then as you look ahead to projects for the rest of the year, I mean, what has improved on the pricing front for you guys? And as a result, might we see a shift in the business mix back more to systems from modules. It seems to be emphasized under Series 6? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. Yes. So on the Moapa side, we saw a slight uptick on the value. It's not significant, but you got to remember when we're guiding to relatively low EPS numbers this year relative to the past, even small movements in project value can change the overall outlook pretty significantly. When we think about future systems values and we're currently negotiating with the sale of our switch assets, so we have a good sense how the market looks there, and we have had a lot of unsolicited proposals for other assets in our pipeline from very credible counter parties. I think the dynamic you're seeing here are there are few large-scale quality assets in 2017 and also into 2018, and that's leading to very robust demand and better pricing in the market. So we're seeing that dynamics flow through, and that's giving us confidence in the rest of this year in the system side. As it relates to moving back to more development, we've always maintained that we will continue to develop in the U.S. and in select other markets where that makes sense. On a long-term run-rate basis, we would expect to have potentially a gigawatt of development. In the short-term that maybe significantly higher proportion of that as we get through the existing pipeline that we have in the U.S. and internationally in 2017, 2018 and 2019. As we go beyond that, when we grow the Series 6 volume, I would still expect us to expand into more module-only sales as a percentage of the total manufacturing capacity that we have, but we'll continue to monitor systems business and if it makes sense, as we said on the question around cash usage, we're very happy to invest in development if we believe there's accretive return above and beyond the module business adjusted for the risk profile we are taking. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. Yeah. I was wondering (40:09) to get that question and hopefully, we can try to make ourselves clear, but sometimes it keeps coming back to that same view. We've never said that we will not continue to do development. We've always said that we're going to continue to do development. We'll do development in the markets which we believe that we can capture inherent value and that we have core competency and differentiation potentially or capabilities that enables us to get appropriate return on capital and U.S. clearly being one of them. So development is a core part of our strategy. It would be part of the value chain in which we look to participate not only here in the U.S., but in Asia, India, APAC, Japan, those markets will clearly be regions, which we'll continue to focus on. The other thing I want to make sure is also understood is the  part of the reason here is particularly in the U.S. is we are starting to see more of a market opportunity for utility owned generation. And I still do believe that in the U.S., the ultimate owner of these assets will potentially evolve to be the utilities. And having that capability of providing turnkey solutions and doing development is going to be putting us in a best position to serve our customers' need. And I think it continues to highlight the unique value composition to utility of the First Solar versus alternatives that they may have. So don't think of us looking to exit development. We'll continue the development. We will look to invest where it's appropriate. And I do think it will best position us long-term to be successful in the U.S. market, in particular. Operator And our next question comes from Tyler Frank of Baird. Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management) Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk about what the current market is like for buyers and utility scale projects, both here in the U.S. and internationally as well as what you're seeing for demand from utilities here in the U.S.? And then shifting gears a bit, when you look at the cost for Series 6, now you've had an opportunity to work on it a little bit more. Can you discuss where that's tracking to your expectations and where you expect the cost profile to get to once you start ramping capacity? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. Why don't we  Alex, why don't you take the market assets with the U.S. international? I'll try to do the demand and the cost discussion. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. Sure. I'd say we're seeing very strong demand. As I mentioned before a little bit, there seems to be dearth of quality large assets in the U.S. in 2017 and even going into 2018. And despite some of the uncertainty in the market around potential tax reform, there's still is a strong appetite from tax equity capital providers from debt providers and from cash equity owners. We are seeing broader sways of buyers coming into the market. So historically, we saw tax equity and some infrastructure players only, [along the side the strategics, the yield cos came and went, I'd say we're seeing more interest from infrastructure money and long-term pension money. So the market remains very resilient in the U.S. in the short- and medium-term. Internationally, it's very dependent on the regions that we're in. We have a development business in Japan. I would say that that's one of the more liquid markets from a debt perspective for solar business. So we're very happy with the debt capital that we've been raising for our assets there, and we have yet to sell large-scale assets in Japan, but we are very confident based on the discussions we've been having with buyers that there is going to be significant appetite for long-term contracted assets in Japan, and we expect to realize good margins out of those assets. Now the markets in the world, it's very dependent, but I'd say generally, we're seeing pretty strong demand in every market where we're continuing to develop assets, both on the debt equity side where relevant on the debt side and on the cash equity side. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. I think on the demand question around, I think it was specific to more U.S. utilities, if I look at U.S. utilities and again, what's really happening is solar, in particular, is kind of the demand associated with it is essentially solely on the merits of the economics. I mean, demand is  the of cost of solar has come down so much, and it's competitive and everyone is looking at long-term integrated resource plans and have a movement more towards integration of solar, and a lot of utilities, there's someone at the forefront of their journey around that. I will say though that I did make my comment about utilities trying to rate base, I do think there is an undertone. A lot of utilities are trying to find a profile and an opportunity to rate base the solar assets, and I think that's really  ultimately, would prefer to do. But I'm not seeing other than utilities in California they're dealing with a number of issues, whether it's the emergence of community choice aggregators and load being pulled away from them or whether it's with the distributed resources such as residential rooftop. They're clearly in a different mindset on how they're thinking about a procurement note, but the vast majority of the other utilities that we're engaging with, I would say, demand is very robust at this point in time. On the cost of Series 6, the one thing I'll reemphasize, I think I said this on the guidance call way back in November is that the towering strength of this company is its people. And we have tremendously talented people, creative, knowledgeable, innovative, and they continue to amaze me and surprise me with their capabilities and where we ultimately can go with this technology. We're very happy with where we are in the timeline and the progression of getting this product commercialized into the market. The reality though is we're not going to stop. When we get the product initially into the market, we're going to continue to drive the efficiency up, the road map is not done. There's still room to grow, and there's still room to drive cost down. And we know that at the end of the day, the technology that will win this marketplace is the highest performing lowest-cost. And we believe we have a platform that can enable that. It creates differentiation and separation relative to our competitors and the journey of where we are at this point in time; I would say we're in a very good position, long ways to go. But I'm not going to commit specifically to the cost profile and the view of where we thought we were going to be. I would just say that I'm very encouraged with the work the team has done and the opportunities that is in front of us. Operator And our next question comes from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks so much, guys. So I have two model questions. So if I look back at the numbers that you're reporting for 2016, both top-line and bottom line, it looks like about $50 million of delta and about $0.28 of EPS is the change, and that's roughly in line with the adjustments in 2017. Is that really what we're seeing here in the 2017 guidance? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. No. So if you go back  and you'll have to wait till you see the Q, but what you're going to see with the change in the accounting standards is you're going to see significant fluctuation quarterly, but on a cumulative basis, the impact is very limited. So the 2017 opening with same earnings impact with a total of about $6 million. So the delta that you're seeing on the accounting standard change have no impact to change we're giving on the guidance side at the moment. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. Yeah, so don't think about this as somehow there's a shift from the result of the adoption, the accounting standard had an adverse impact on Q4 and then somehow benefited 2017. That's not the effect. The point that Alex mentioned, the retained earnings impact was small and that was a cumulative impact. We had to go back a number of years to effectively restate under the new accounting standard what the implications would have been, and that was a nominal impact to retained earnings. What's flowing through in the guidance for 2017 is we've indicated is just operational results, better cost per watt and better visibility around valuation for project sales. Operator And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks for taking the question guys. In your remarks, you had some language about improvement in the landscape, industry landscape for project economics. And I guess, I would ask, when you say it's getting better, what's the baseline? What are you comparing that to, 2016, a year ago? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. I'd say we're comparing that to how we saw the market at the time we gave our guidance. So when we came out with our original guidance in November last year and then updated in February, we're seeing a significant change in how we are perceiving the value of our assets since that time based on feedback we've been getting from the market, both from the sale of the switch asset and then also from unsolicited process we've had relative to some other projects that we have. So we're basing it on feedback from the market as opposed to when we originally gave guidance when we had perhaps less clarity specific to those discrete assets. Operator And we will take our final question from Edwin Mok of Needham & Company. Arthur Su - Needham & Company, LLC Hi everyone. This is actually Arthur on for Edwin. Thanks for taking our questions. The first one is just on the Series 6 transition beyond the initial line in Ohio and the eight lines in Malaysia. Can you give us the initial look at the milestones you have in place for the other production facilities? And then secondly, can you provide an update on any progress in penetrating international markets? I think in the past, you've highlighted Australia and India. Yeah. Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. So the transition  in the last earnings call, and unfortunately, I don't have the slide, so when we talked about there, we had a timeline that actually showed the major milestones in the progression of where we are. What I would say right now is that we now have approval and actually we are in the process now of, again  Perrysburg has been completely tore down, we're starting to receive some of the tools. The two plants in Malaysia have actually been  equipment's been removed now in the process of getting ready to receive tools. And then we've actually started momentum now moving into Vietnam. And so we refer to as the first phase is Terra 0 and then Terra 1 (50:38), which is the Plant 5 and 6 in Malaysia and then Terra 2 (50:43) being in Vietnam. And all of that's in progress right now, so we've got three different work streams of activities that were ongoing, which when you aggregate up that capacity across those three that will get us to about 3 gigawatts of production. And then the next phase will be referred to as Terra 3 (51:04), which will give us another 1.1 gigawatts or so of production, and that's really should be largely running up at least on a run-rate basis as we get through the end of 2018, beginning of 2019, we'll be on that kind of run rate across that platform of those two  of those Terra 0, 1, 2 and ultimately Terra 3 (51:20). So we feel good about it. And there's a timeline we had in the last earnings call, maybe to give you a little bit more color from the standpoint. The international markets continue to be very robust and there's continuing engagement with us. The one thing I will say though is that we are capacity constrained right now around Series 4 and as it relates to some of that demand profile that we're seeing in the international markets, they're looking for module shipments that would happen later this year into the first half of 2018. And so as it relates to having limited module supply, that constraints a little bit to engage in some of those discussions. And then the first half of the  the second half of 2018, the production that will produce Series 6 largely is going to be allocated to our own development assets. So we're really looking at a timeline of getting out into 2019 before we really have a lot of supply that we can engage the market with, and then particularly address some of the international market opportunities. But what I'll say is that we are almost always kind of a supplier of choice and when there's an opportunity where ever it is, whether it's domestic or international, we're generally giving an opportunity to address those market potentials, especially in markets where we have a good  an advantage or a temperature co efficiency, factor respond, hot humid climates, particular. There's clearly a poll for our technology. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator And we will take our first one from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, if you assume the 8point3 strategic process results in more capital to deploy, I know that's an assumption at this point, but how should we be thinking about priorities? Are you looking to fast-track Series 6? Do you build more capacity than the current base case or would it be something else? Just trying to get a sense for what the uses of capital would be, and then I have a follow-up. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. Yeah, so Brian, clearly the liquidity position is strong today. And we've made a strategic decision to maintain both an unlevered balance sheet and a net cash position given cyclicality in the solar industry. The business is in a transition period between Series 4 and Series 6, which is capital-intensive, and we intend to grow that Series 6 capacity from a position of strength. So in terms of how we think about capital, we really look to award full of cash needs and opportunities. So firstly, we fund our operations; secondly, we look to invest in manufacturing capacity that's both the current Series 6 announced capacity and then the ability to grow beyond that as the more opportunity presents. We look to fund the development business, and that includes long-term systems opportunities relative  that provides incremental returns relative to the module business and relative to the risk-adjusted cost of capital associated with those projects. After that, we look at M&A, and that's post the sale of existing assets, investments, and also opportunities to invest in other growth opportunities, so we continue to look at synergistic M&A opportunities, both around the technology and around project development. And then finally on top of that, we make sure we have an adequate buffer to provide liquidity through cyclicality in the industry volatility. So once you go through all of those, we look to prioritize our capital and see where we can use it. Assuming at that point, we had excess capital which we didn't leave could be accretively deployed in business then we look to return that capital to shareholders. So that's an ongoing analysis. And we'll obviously continue to monitor the capital and liquidity position as we move through the Series 6 transition and through other events this year, including the sale of 8point3 and the systems business sales. The other thing that we take into account is, geographically, about half of our cash sits offshore and is subsequently invested offshore. Should we have any tax reform or anything else that impacts the ability to use that cash, that would obviously play into the calculation as well. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay, okay, great, fair enough. Appreciate the color. Second question, I guess, this is, obviously, kind of front-and-center topic. I'm sure there's going to be a number of questions around this. But can you guys speak to the Section 201 request from one of your manufacturing peers in the U.S.? I guess, I'd be curious to know if it's impacting your approach to booking, the remaining Series 4 capacity you outlined? And then with respect to Series 6, and then if your current contracted bookings have any contingencies that would allow for pricing to be recalibrated? And then lastly, with respect to Series 6, how this potentially factors into your thinking around timing, investment and then just the general strategy there? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. All right, Brian, there's a lot there, so I'll try to  hopefully I got most of your questions. First off, as it relates to the Tier 1 case, we're obviously very aware of it. We're looking closely at the filing. Clearly, I think the spirit of the reason for the filing is rooted in the fact that there's clearly an oversupply in this industry, and we believe that really is an issue. And we also believe that there is a need for free and fair trade, and there's also a need for enforcement around that. So all that I think provides a undertone of the merits of what the case relates to. As you also know that thin-film is not included. It's not included in the criteria of the basis of what the case is currently structured for, which would exclude not only our production here, obviously, in the U.S., but, obviously, our production outside of the U.S., currently in Malaysia and then ultimately, into Vietnam. As it relates to our strategy, we're going to continue to move forward, we're going to continue to address the market, we're going to continue to provide high value to our customers in the best possible product in the marketplace, whether it's Series 4 or whether it's Series 6. We'll enter into our contracts, a lot of the obligations that are in those contracts, we are not structuring contracts for the most part that would enable some form of a repricing. But if the case were to creates some merit, and if we now have, again, a different view of where the market (30:40) price is for crystalline silicon, that could inform our views a little bit around how we think about our pricing strategy for both Series 4 and Series 6, but that's clearly off into the future. As it relates to our view around manufacturing capacity and where we think about Series 6, our commitments still is the priorities that we talked about before for Perrysburg, then Malaysia and then Vietnam. We've also highlighted though that we have flexibility in the toolset that we're currently installing in Ohio, that could allow us some optionality of increasing capacity of Series 6 in Perrysburg, and we'd look to this maybe as one factor that would inform our decision around that. The other would be, I'd argue that corporate tax rate would be another one that would inform our  U.S. corporate tax rate would inform our view around adding incremental capacity into our facility in Ohio. So there's a lot of moving pieces we're going to continue to assess and evaluate. And again, I think the whole fundamental issue though that we shall be focused on is, we're very happy with where we are with our launch of Series 6, that's in great position. This trade case or other issues that may arise from it may also inform our view of little bit around how long we continue to produce in Perrysburg. We've highlighted that our current view is we've optionality of maybe pulling a couple of hundred megawatts out, which really is there to facilitate the transition into Series 6 to the extent there is some traction around this case, we may continue to produce that 200 megawatt, maybe not only through 2018, but beyond 2018, if need may be. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. Brian, with regards to Series 6 timing, we're already on a pretty aggressive schedule there, so I don't see that changes. As Mark said, we have flexibility around the Series 4 supply to keep that going longer should we need it. Operator And we'll take our next question from Philip Shen of ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC Hi. Thanks for the questions. As a follow-up on the Section 201 topic. If the Section 201 gets implemented, do you see any changes to your production plans for 2018. For example, would you move to produce either more or less of Series 4 or Series 6 than you had previously indicated? And could you sell the Series 6 externally in 2018 versus prior plans of keeping, I believe, most of it in-house? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. Phil, I think I sort of alluded to a little bit in my comments to Brian's question, but it really did  other than the timing of when we would actually wind down our production of Series 4 in Perrysburg, it really doesn't inform our views beyond that in 2018. Now if the trade case were to get some traction, could we look to continue producing some Series 4 in Perrysburg as an example, potentially? Again, the other thing, but again, it's a longer date of horizon depending on what happens with this case. We have the optionality of adding incremental capacity in Perrysburg if need be. Again, the toolset accommodates production volume that is closer to 1.1 gigawatts versus the currently planned 550 megawatts, so a lot there to be evaluated. But I think we're very early. I mean, obviously, as you know the trade case was just filed here recently. A lot will happen and evolve over the next months and quarters, and as we get a clear picture of what direction it's going, we have options and decisions that will make at that point in time. Operator And we will take our next question from Krish Sankar of Bank of America. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, if the California Flats and Moapa projects do get sold to 8point3 or a third party, is that in your forecast for this year? A  [06G0M8-E Mark Widmar]>: So the Moapa project has already been completed, and that's in the Q1 revenue. The California Flats project is assumed to be sold this year. Now whether it goes to 8point3 or to another third party, it is going to dependent on 8point3's appetite ability to acquire that project. So the partnership and 8point3 is currently reviewing that asset. The indication I would given the capital requirements to acquire that, 8point3 is likely not going to do so. But if that's the case, we're going to sell it to a third party, but the value of that project is in our guidance for the year, timing remains a little uncertain. The other project that is in that perhaps you're thinking of this is a switch project, so that's in our numbers for the year and we're assuming comes in Q3 although there is a chance that could accelerate into Q2. Operator And our next question comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. So I have two questions. One is can you just clarify the comments you made on production output of Series 6 in 2018? Do you say 550 megawatts or could it be up to a 1 gigawatt of output in 2018? And then as far as the cash balance is concerned, I think you had previously said that your cash distribution is going to -net cash could go down until Q1, Q2 of next year. Is that still the case? Or do you expect cash to improve over the next couple of quarters? Thank you. A  [06G0M8-E Mark Widmar]>: On the Series 6 production, let makes sure, I'm clear on that, and I'll let Alex to take the cash question. But Series 6 what I had  what the 550 megawatts represented, 550 megawatts is the fully ramp capacity that we're currently are planning in our Perrysburg facility, all right. And we won't actually start producing in Perrysburg until the middle of next year, so we won't have a full year output from Perrysburg. But in aggregate across Perrysburg, across KLM, for example, our Malaysia facility, we anticipate to have a little bit north of around 1 gigawatts, maybe a little bit north of a gigawatt production of Series 6 in 2018. Again, with that all that production largely happening in the second half of 2018. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. Yes, on the cash side, so we raised on net cash guidance by $100 million, so $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion for the end of this year, and that's including the CapEx we're planning on spending for the year. So $525 million to $625 million, of which we spent a little over $100 million in the first quarter. So we're on track on the CapEx side. The cash balance for the end of the year will go up slightly relative to previous guidance. We haven't guided to be on that, but we will continue to spend CapEx through to 2018. And as we've mentioned before, 2018, when we started with Series 4 product in Q1 and Q2, it's the time that product is going to be most challenged relative to the competition given that we're no longer investing in the development of Series 4 as we focus on Series 6. So we haven't guided out to a number, but we would expect to continue to spend CapEx all the Series 6 transition through 2018, but we're, obviously, going to end the year with a very robust cash balance, and the cash guidance that number we're giving here through the end of the year doesn't include any proceeds from 8point3. Operator And we will take our next question from Andrew Hughes of Credit Suisse. Andrew Hughes - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Congrats on the quarter. I had a question on Moapa and guidance and then one of tax equity, if you don't mind. Just on the Moapa result, can you give us a sense of what drove better margins? Was it pricing or more of the internal transfer costs? And then as you look ahead to projects for the rest of the year, I mean, what has improved on the pricing front for you guys? And as a result, might we see a shift in the business mix back more to systems from modules. It seems to be emphasized under Series 6? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. Yes. So on the Moapa side, we saw a slight uptick on the value. It's not significant, but you got to remember when we're guiding to relatively low EPS numbers this year relative to the past, even small movements in project value can change the overall outlook pretty significantly. When we think about future systems values and we're currently negotiating with the sale of our switch assets, so we have a good sense how the market looks there, and we have had a lot of unsolicited proposals for other assets in our pipeline from very credible counter parties. I think the dynamic you're seeing here are there are few large-scale quality assets in 2017 and also into 2018, and that's leading to very robust demand and better pricing in the market. So we're seeing that dynamics flow through, and that's giving us confidence in the rest of this year in the system side. As it relates to moving back to more development, we've always maintained that we will continue to develop in the U.S. and in select other markets where that makes sense. On a long-term run-rate basis, we would expect to have potentially a gigawatt of development. In the short-term that maybe significantly higher proportion of that as we get through the existing pipeline that we have in the U.S. and internationally in 2017, 2018 and 2019. As we go beyond that, when we grow the Series 6 volume, I would still expect us to expand into more module-only sales as a percentage of the total manufacturing capacity that we have, but we'll continue to monitor systems business and if it makes sense, as we said on the question around cash usage, we're very happy to invest in development if we believe there's accretive return above and beyond the module business adjusted for the risk profile we are taking. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. Yeah. I was wondering (40:09) to get that question and hopefully, we can try to make ourselves clear, but sometimes it keeps coming back to that same view. We've never said that we will not continue to do development. We've always said that we're going to continue to do development. We'll do development in the markets which we believe that we can capture inherent value and that we have core competency and differentiation potentially or capabilities that enables us to get appropriate return on capital and U.S. clearly being one of them. So development is a core part of our strategy. It would be part of the value chain in which we look to participate not only here in the U.S., but in Asia, India, APAC, Japan, those markets will clearly be regions, which we'll continue to focus on. The other thing I want to make sure is also understood is the  part of the reason here is particularly in the U.S. is we are starting to see more of a market opportunity for utility owned generation. And I still do believe that in the U.S., the ultimate owner of these assets will potentially evolve to be the utilities. And having that capability of providing turnkey solutions and doing development is going to be putting us in a best position to serve our customers' need. And I think it continues to highlight the unique value composition to utility of the First Solar versus alternatives that they may have. So don't think of us looking to exit development. We'll continue the development. We will look to invest where it's appropriate. And I do think it will best position us long-term to be successful in the U.S. market, in particular. Operator And our next question comes from Tyler Frank of Baird. Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management) Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk about what the current market is like for buyers and utility scale projects, both here in the U.S. and internationally as well as what you're seeing for demand from utilities here in the U.S.? And then shifting gears a bit, when you look at the cost for Series 6, now you've had an opportunity to work on it a little bit more. Can you discuss where that's tracking to your expectations and where you expect the cost profile to get to once you start ramping capacity? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. Why don't we  Alex, why don't you take the market assets with the U.S. international? I'll try to do the demand and the cost discussion. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. Sure. I'd say we're seeing very strong demand. As I mentioned before a little bit, there seems to be dearth of quality large assets in the U.S. in 2017 and even going into 2018. And despite some of the uncertainty in the market around potential tax reform, there's still is a strong appetite from tax equity capital providers from debt providers and from cash equity owners. We are seeing broader sways of buyers coming into the market. So historically, we saw tax equity and some infrastructure players only, [along the side the strategics, the yield cos came and went, I'd say we're seeing more interest from infrastructure money and long-term pension money. So the market remains very resilient in the U.S. in the short- and medium-term. Internationally, it's very dependent on the regions that we're in. We have a development business in Japan. I would say that that's one of the more liquid markets from a debt perspective for solar business. So we're very happy with the debt capital that we've been raising for our assets there, and we have yet to sell large-scale assets in Japan, but we are very confident based on the discussions we've been having with buyers that there is going to be significant appetite for long-term contracted assets in Japan, and we expect to realize good margins out of those assets. Now the markets in the world, it's very dependent, but I'd say generally, we're seeing pretty strong demand in every market where we're continuing to develop assets, both on the debt equity side where relevant on the debt side and on the cash equity side. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. I think on the demand question around, I think it was specific to more U.S. utilities, if I look at U.S. utilities and again, what's really happening is solar, in particular, is kind of the demand associated with it is essentially solely on the merits of the economics. I mean, demand is  the of cost of solar has come down so much, and it's competitive and everyone is looking at long-term integrated resource plans and have a movement more towards integration of solar, and a lot of utilities, there's someone at the forefront of their journey around that. I will say though that I did make my comment about utilities trying to rate base, I do think there is an undertone. A lot of utilities are trying to find a profile and an opportunity to rate base the solar assets, and I think that's really  ultimately, would prefer to do. But I'm not seeing other than utilities in California they're dealing with a number of issues, whether it's the emergence of community choice aggregators and load being pulled away from them or whether it's with the distributed resources such as residential rooftop. They're clearly in a different mindset on how they're thinking about a procurement note, but the vast majority of the other utilities that we're engaging with, I would say, demand is very robust at this point in time. On the cost of Series 6, the one thing I'll reemphasize, I think I said this on the guidance call way back in November is that the towering strength of this company is its people. And we have tremendously talented people, creative, knowledgeable, innovative, and they continue to amaze me and surprise me with their capabilities and where we ultimately can go with this technology. We're very happy with where we are in the timeline and the progression of getting this product commercialized into the market. The reality though is we're not going to stop. When we get the product initially into the market, we're going to continue to drive the efficiency up, the road map is not done. There's still room to grow, and there's still room to drive cost down. And we know that at the end of the day, the technology that will win this marketplace is the highest performing lowest-cost. And we believe we have a platform that can enable that. It creates differentiation and separation relative to our competitors and the journey of where we are at this point in time; I would say we're in a very good position, long ways to go. But I'm not going to commit specifically to the cost profile and the view of where we thought we were going to be. I would just say that I'm very encouraged with the work the team has done and the opportunities that is in front of us. Operator And our next question comes from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks so much, guys. So I have two model questions. So if I look back at the numbers that you're reporting for 2016, both top-line and bottom line, it looks like about $50 million of delta and about $0.28 of EPS is the change, and that's roughly in line with the adjustments in 2017. Is that really what we're seeing here in the 2017 guidance? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. No. So if you go back  and you'll have to wait till you see the Q, but what you're going to see with the change in the accounting standards is you're going to see significant fluctuation quarterly, but on a cumulative basis, the impact is very limited. So the 2017 opening with same earnings impact with a total of about $6 million. So the delta that you're seeing on the accounting standard change have no impact to change we're giving on the guidance side at the moment. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. Yeah, so don't think about this as somehow there's a shift from the result of the adoption, the accounting standard had an adverse impact on Q4 and then somehow benefited 2017. That's not the effect. The point that Alex mentioned, the retained earnings impact was small and that was a cumulative impact. We had to go back a number of years to effectively restate under the new accounting standard what the implications would have been, and that was a nominal impact to retained earnings. What's flowing through in the guidance for 2017 is we've indicated is just operational results, better cost per watt and better visibility around valuation for project sales. Operator And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks for taking the question guys. In your remarks, you had some language about improvement in the landscape, industry landscape for project economics. And I guess, I would ask, when you say it's getting better, what's the baseline? What are you comparing that to, 2016, a year ago? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc. I'd say we're comparing that to how we saw the market at the time we gave our guidance. So when we came out with our original guidance in November last year and then updated in February, we're seeing a significant change in how we are perceiving the value of our assets since that time based on feedback we've been getting from the market, both from the sale of the switch asset and then also from unsolicited process we've had relative to some other projects that we have. So we're basing it on feedback from the market as opposed to when we originally gave guidance when we had perhaps less clarity specific to those discrete assets. Operator And we will take our final question from Edwin Mok of Needham & Company. Arthur Su - Needham & Company, LLC Hi everyone. This is actually Arthur on for Edwin. Thanks for taking our questions. The first one is just on the Series 6 transition beyond the initial line in Ohio and the eight lines in Malaysia. Can you give us the initial look at the milestones you have in place for the other production facilities? And then secondly, can you provide an update on any progress in penetrating international markets? I think in the past, you've highlighted Australia and India. Yeah. Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc. So the transition  in the last earnings call, and unfortunately, I don't have the slide, so when we talked about there, we had a timeline that actually showed the major milestones in the progression of where we are. What I would say right now is that we now have approval and actually we are in the process now of, again  Perrysburg has been completely tore down, we're starting to receive some of the tools. The two plants in Malaysia have actually been  equipment's been removed now in the process of getting ready to receive tools. And then we've actually started momentum now moving into Vietnam. And so we refer to as the first phase is Terra 0 and then Terra 1 (50:38), which is the Plant 5 and 6 in Malaysia and then Terra 2 (50:43) being in Vietnam. And all of that's in progress right now, so we've got three different work streams of activities that were ongoing, which when you aggregate up that capacity across those three that will get us to about 3 gigawatts of production. And then the next phase will be referred to as Terra 3 (51:04), which will give us another 1.1 gigawatts or so of production, and that's really should be largely running up at least on a run-rate basis as we get through the end of 2018, beginning of 2019, we'll be on that kind of run rate across that platform of those two  of those Terra 0, 1, 2 and ultimately Terra 3 (51:20). So we feel good about it. And there's a timeline we had in the last earnings call, maybe to give you a little bit more color from the standpoint. The international markets continue to be very robust and there's continuing engagement with us. The one thing I will say though is that we are capacity constrained right now around Series 4 and as it relates to some of that demand profile that we're seeing in the international markets, they're looking for module shipments that would happen later this year into the first half of 2018. And so as it relates to having limited module supply, that constraints a little bit to engage in some of those discussions. And then the first half of the  the second half of 2018, the production that will produce Series 6 largely is going to be allocated to our own development assets. So we're really looking at a timeline of getting out into 2019 before we really have a lot of supply that we can engage the market with, and then particularly address some of the international market opportunities. But what I'll say is that we are almost always kind of a supplier of choice and when there's an opportunity where ever it is, whether it's domestic or international, we're generally giving an opportunity to address those market potentials, especially in markets where we have a good  an advantage or a temperature co efficiency, factor respond, hot humid climates, particular. There's clearly a poll for our technology. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

(NASDAQ: GILD ) Bank of America Merrill Lynch Healthcare Broker Conference Call May 18, 2017, 12:20 ET Executives Sung Lee - VP, IR  Kevin Young - COO Analysts Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Ying Huang I think we should start it. Thanks for coming to the day 3 of the BofA Merrill Lynch Health Care Conference. I think I\'m sure Sung and Kevin are really are gratified to see such a full house in this room on day 3.  So my name is Ying Huang and I\'m the senior biotech analyst here at BofA Merrill. We\'re very pleased to have Gilead which obviously doesn\'t need any introduction. It\'s a household name in biotech. And we have Kevin Young, the Chief Operating Officer of Gilead. To my left also, we have Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations, from Gilead. So I don\'t think these folks have any slides. We\'ll just kick in to the fireside chat.  If you have any questions from the audience, feel free to raise your hand and we\'ll get a mic to you. Question-and-Answer Session Q - Ying Huang So maybe, why don\'t we start from maybe HIV side of your business, Kevin. First of all, we\'re expecting the Phase III data from bictegravir in HIV midyear. What is your expectation of the results based on what you saw from the Phase II trial? And how critical is this molecule in terms of gaining back your share of keeping your leadership in HIV, especially considering what happened from dolutegravir introduced by GSK? Kevin Young So to thank you for the question, Ying. Thank you for the invitation. We\'re delighted to be here. I would just say very quickly we\'re pleased with the start of the year for Gilead. I think some very solid HCV numbers, thrilled by the uptake of our TAF-based regimens in HIV. And I\'m sure we\'ll come to it, some very nice progress in our pipeline. Specifically to your question, as we\'ve publicly announced, we will have results from the bic/F/TAF studies in this quarter in Q2. And then our hope would be, subject everything being okay, to put our registration in the third quarter. Typically, we can turn around our HIV programs very quickly and put in our regulatory submissions. As we said, the studies, particularly the 2 primary studies which are the comparative studies, 600 patients in each studies, they\'re non-inferiority studies. We would be very pleased to get those non-inferiority endpoints. That would be a positive for us and I think it would put us in a very good competitive situation. What we like about bic/F/TAF, bictegravir F/TAF, is that we see it as really a combination of 2 very good worlds, where you\'ve got an unboosted integrate inhibitor. Integrate inhibitors now are the primary preferred third agent and then you have the strength of a preferred backbone in TAF. And as you\'ve seen from Genvoya, the uptake of TAF is going exceedingly, exceedingly well, both here and the United States and now momentum very much building in Europe. So it\'s a very important launch for us. We think it\'s great. We think it\'s great for patients. We will be putting an incredible amount of energy. We know HIV very, very well as you all know, so it\'s important. It\'s important to us. But let me say that we really now have a family of TAF-based products and Genvoya is part of that. Descovy is part of that. Odefsey is part of that. And of course, bic/F/TAF is going to be, we believe, very, very additive to that. Some of that is conversion of existing regimens for Gilead and some of it actually is taking business away from the competition. About 10% of Genvoya comes from other regimens right now and so it\'s very additive to us. Ying Huang Thank you, Kevin. So as you mentioned, the TAF-containing regimens grew about 44% in first quarter compared to fourth quarter 2016. Do you think the pace of growth will continue to increase or stabilize at this pace in the next few quarters? And then if you look at the marketplace, what are the main drivers of that switch or commercial success? Kevin Young I definitely think that our TAF-based regimens, primarily Genvoya here in the United States, is a little bit different in the European markets, but primarily Genvoya here will continue to grow I think very impressively. It\'s really based on the population of HIV patients. I was looking at data recently and you\'ve got half of HIV patients in the United States are over the age of 50. And physicians want to be kinder from a bone point of view, from a renal point of view and that\'s the profile of TAF. So it\'s really hitting, I think, the right target from the point of view of the patients that we\'re treating. It\'s basically the same in Europe. Countries are at different staggered places in their launch. We\'ve already got 60% of HIV Gilead prescriptions converted to TAF in Germany. Spain is going well. We just started in Italy and France. So we think the same can be reproduced in the European market, albeit that they\'re on a slightly different time frame. But it\'s really about older HIV patients and long term care. The latest statistics is that a 20 year old is likely to add another 50 years plus in terms of life expectancy from chronic HIV treatment. So you\'re talking about an aging population and that\'s where TAF is very applicable. Ying Huang So you mentioned the European marketplace. We know that you\'re expected to lose market exclusivity for Viread and also Truvada in second half in Europe. What do you think the impact will be in the European marketplace? Do you think that will create negative pricing pressure on your branded franchise in Europe with that introduction of generics? Kevin Young It\'s a good question. So what Ying is bringing up is that, yes, we will be losing our European patent on TDF. We\'ve already lost our FTC patent in Europe. So the effect that we\'ll see will be on Viread, Truvada and Atripla. But of course, if you like, they are older products because the markets are converting into TAF-based regimens. Descovy -- by the way, Descovy is very important in Europe. Some of the markets didn\'t -- haven\'t adopted single tablets quite as much as United States, so Descovy, Odefsey and Genvoya. So it\'ll be a country-by-country introduction of the generics and those markets will have different proportions of TAF adoption at the time when the generics come to market. So we think, yes, there will be an effect. But in the long term, we will ride out that effect, again by the launch of our TAF-based regimens. Let me say again that TAF is the preferred regimen in guidelines. Once you have reimbursement in your European markets and like any pharmaceutical, you go through rigorous negotiations. But once you have reimbursement, then the physicians can make the choice. In France, in Italy, in Spain, they can make the choice. And in HIV, they follow guidelines extensively. And those guidelines are preferring TAF. In fact, the IAS guidelines, the International AIDS Society guidelines downgraded TDF. It\'s not a preferred regimen now. It\'s not a preferred molecule, so that encourages physicians to be using TAF. So I think we\'ll see country by country a little bit of a mix of the effect of the loss of exclusivity on TDF. Ying Huang Great. So even with the commercial success of Tivicay or Triumeq by GSK, still most of U.S.-based physicians do not really like the abacavir component of the single-tablet regimen from GSK. And then GSK is also testing a so-called doublet which is dolutegravir plus 3TC here. So how competitive do you think that regimen could be? And the simplified doublet, would that actually gain some more this year in the U.S.? Kevin Young So you\'re right. I think there\'s always been a question mark about abacavir and it didn\'t surprise us that our competition decided to remove that from a triple regimen. Let me say here and now that we\'re not doing any form of double combinations. We\'re very committed to triple therapy. We believe it\'s the way to go. It\'s the standard of care. We\'re very comfortable. The size of the tablets of bic/F/TAF will be very, very small because the dosage, the milligrams or the components are very, very low, so we\'re very comfortable with that. We believe that we\'ve come so far in HIV. Why go backwards? I think it\'s interesting, Ying, that the studies that have been tested with these sort of pairs of antivirals have viral load cutoffs. And that -- frankly that -- I think that worries Gilead. I think that probably would worry the HIV community. Again, if you look at guidelines and you look at the preferred regimens in guidelines, they don\'t have any viral load cutoff. And I think it\'s potentially confusing and potentially worrisome that you\'d have to be thinking about the viral load of the patient if you\'re initiating therapy. So we\'re very comfortable with our triple therapies. And again, subject to the data, we think bic/F/TAF is a great combination. Ying Huang So obviously, Genvoya is already a great medication for HIV. If you compare the bic/F/TAF to Genvoya, what is the advantage here in terms of clinical benefit? Because I know it\'s a little too early or premature to talk about. But still, Genvoya, I think, loses patent production around 2025. Sung Lee 2029. Ying Huang \'29. Sung Lee Yes. Ying Huang So at that point, what is the driver for a physician to use the bic/F/TAF versus Genvoya if it\'s a great medication already? Kevin Young Well, I think you\'re looking a long way out, Ying. I try to live in the here and now. And very much the -- if you like, the next 5 years where I think the opportunities are tremendous for Gilead. I think everything we\'ve heard from our advisers is an unboosted integrase on the backbone of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide is a really, really good combination. Ying Huang Do you have anything to add, Sung? Sung Lee Also, fewer drug-drug interactions potentially with an older population, so that would be an advantage as well. Ying Huang Okay. Kevin Young But I think perhaps to your question, I think Genvoya, there are going to be patients who are very, very happy on Genvoya and stay on Genvoya even when we launch bic/F/TAF. Ying Huang So I guess we should switch gears a little bit to your HCV business now. In the first quarter, it seems that we\'re seeing a somewhat stabilizing trend. I know it\'s a little bit premature to talk about that. But still, how do you see that business evolving in terms of pricing trend, in terms of identifying and also treating those new patients as well as the competitive dynamics with the Merck introduction of Zepatier and then the upcoming competition from the G/P once-daily, single-tablet regimen from AbbVie? Kevin Young I think it\'s about five questions there, Ying. I\'ll try and let me try... Ying Huang Well, because I\'m very [indiscernible] I always say it\'s one question for everybody. So I\'m trying to pack a 5-part question. Kevin Young Sung can help me on -- if my memory goes on the fourth or fifth question. Yes, let me go to the dynamics. We really try to be, I think, thoughtful, realistic, objective in the way we put out our guidance and gave you a lot of information, gave you the insights that we really have. We still believe whilst this is a very attractive market, hepatitis C is declining. And 1 quarter is not a trend. I -- we still believe that there will be a declining number of patients and the guidance we put out for the U.S. is what we\'re currently standing by. There is a different population of patients now being treated. They\'re less sick. They\'re relatively new to physicians. Physicians have followed their hepatitis C patients for a long time. Often, they failed or they were just monitoring the progress. And of course, they mobilized in 2014, particularly 2015.  This has mobilized in wanting to treat those patients. So we\'re seeing a different profile. Patients that haven\'t had previous therapy, their fibrosis score is a lot lower. So it\'s a different type of patient. In terms of pricing, we have not seen a -- we\'ve not really seen a change this year. A little bit change in the mix in the first quarter between Epclusa and Harvoni. I think we\'re coming through the Epclusa sort of mini warehouse. It\'s -- Epclusa has proved to be a great addition to our HCV offering in the -- particular in the genotype-2 and genotype-3 patients. So it\'s done really, really well. But there was a little bit of a -- that declined a bit and so that was sort of a mix change between Harvoni and Epclusa. We have built in the effect of competition, as you know, in our guidance. What they\'re going to do in the second half of this year remains to be seen, but we still really, really believe that we have the best offering in our sofosbuvir-based regimens. Harvoni in the genotype 1, half the patients are treated within 8 weeks today; Epclusa for the genotype 2 and 3. And we hope in early August that we\'ll have SOF/VEL/VOX approved for the failure for the resistant patients. Small group, but we think it\'s the right thing to do for hepatitis C. Did I leave anything out, Sung? Sung Lee I think you\'ve got it covered. Ying Huang So you have been doing so-called direct-to-consumer or DTC, campaign. How effective has that campaign been so far in terms of helping you identify and, diagnose these new patients? Kevin Young Maybe I can answer that and perhaps a slightly bigger picture in terms of the investments that we make in hepatitis C. A lot of people have asked, "Are you going to suddenly sort of almost decrease all your investments in hepatitis C?" No, that\'s not the case. It\'s still a very, very big and important part of Gilead. We have incredibly efficient size of field force in our general educational support. But the one thing that we have supported quite strongly is direct to the consumer, as you say, Ying. There\'s 2 parts to that. There is the educational advertising that we do around baby boomers and the need to be tested. And interestingly, we actually have seen a little tick-up in the amount of HCV testing that\'s been taking place since we put the baby boomer advertisement out there. And then the other part of it and it\'s what we do more from a weighted point of view, is the Harvoni actual branded. So that\'s where if you have hepatitis C, you should go in and ask your physician about Harvoni. And we just launched a brand-new campaign. It\'s called Let Go, so really let go of your hepatitis C. And that really has -- does support patients going in and asking for Harvoni as a brand. So we\'ll use both of those during the year and we\'ll modulate. We tend to cycle and modulate, but they are quite effective. Ying Huang And then maybe we can talk about also the long term market of HCV. I know you probably don\'t want to make a prediction for the future yet. And do you think, Kevin, there\'s any different dynamics between the U.S. market and the international market for HCV? Kevin Young Yes. We\'ve got -- let me try and talk about the 3 sort of segments, the 3 large segments of the world. The U.S., people want to try and peg when we\'ll see equilibrium or a turning point. I honestly don\'t think we\'ll know that until we\'ve gone past it. I think we\'ll see that almost in the rearview mirror. I think we\'ll probably see that settling probably 9 months after it actually happens. So is it happening right now? We don\'t think it is right now. We still think it\'s got -- we got a while before we find that sort of equilibrium. Europe is obviously staggered. So you\'ve got different countries at different stages of treatment. Germany is very much like the U.S. now. They\'re treating F0s to F2s, so they are very advanced. They\'ve gone through their patients. Italy is still treating F3s and F4s. France has just opened up the F2 patients to be treated, so you\'ve always got kind of a staggered effect. Finally, Japan. Japan is a remarkable effect. The peak of treatment which was the fourth quarter in 2015 in Japan, they were treating as many patients as a whole of Europe. Such is the problem. But they\'ve come over the other side and treatment has dropped off. A lot of the patients in Japan are over the age of 80, so there\'s always a question mark about treating them. Are they -- should they be treated? Are they physically fit? But we\'re doing our part. We\'re trying to get the message of treatment into the more peripheral centers in Japan and we actually do -- we\'re actually doing educational direct-to-the-consumer television advertising in Japan to try and alert that there are treatments and good outcomes. Ying Huang Okay, great. We just saw that the House passed a so-called repeal and replace bill. And we don\'t know the fate of this bill in the Senate. But hypothetically, if it does get passed and when they repeal the ObamaCare with the new healthcare regime, so what could be the potential impact on the Gilead business because you do have quite a lot of exposure to the government payers in both your HCV and HIV business? Kevin Young That\'s a great question, Ying. About -- it\'s interesting. The HCV is almost the opposite of the HIV. About 55% of HCV is in the private and about 45% is in the public. It\'s the reverse for HIV. It\'s sort of the 45% is in the private and 55% is in the public. What is going to happen? I\'m sure there -- I\'m sure I\'m no different from anybody else in this room. We\'ll just have to see how this unfolds. The one thing I would say is that HIV is generally, I would say almost always, had bipartisan support. If you think about the Ryan White CARE Act and the ADAP program, that\'s always had across-the-aisle support to making sure that HIV patients have good access. So I think whether it\'s Republican, Democrat, perhaps new legislation, I think HIV, again, as I\'ve said earlier, we\'ve come so far. I don\'t think we want to jeopardize the stability of well-controlled patients and doing something -- we\'re really doing well now about trying to address infection rates, whether it\'s treatments as a way of reducing infection rates or whether it be PrEP. And I think we certainly found in our life at Gilead, 30 years, that we\'ve -- irrespective of political party, people embrace the need to do the right thing in HIV. Ying Huang Okay. That\'s fair. So maybe we should switch gears to the NASH program. Couple of questions here, Kevin. Number one, how do you see the commercial opportunity in this market which obviously has been untapped for a long time because we don\'t have an FDA-approved therapy? And then secondly, given the Phase II data you guys generate in the ASK1 program, how do you think that compound will address the market? Obviously, you\'re trying to focus on the so-called cirrhotic or F4 NASH patients. Kevin Young Yes. Just as a recap, we\'ve got 3 assets in NASH. We\'re excited about them all. We think we have a very good array of mechanisms that we\'re approaching NASH from several angles. First and foremost, we got the anti-fibrotic, our ASK1 inhibitor. That\'s now in Phase III testing. Two studies that are called STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4. That\'s F3 and F4, so that\'s the more advanced patient. I\'ll come back to why. And then we\'ve got our ACC which is in Phase II testing. And also our FXR which is also in Phase II testing. So I think we\'re in a really nice position. And I think certainly for the Phase IIs, back end of this year, we\'ll have more news. Recruitments going nicely in our Phase IIIs and no news this year, really, from that -- from selonsertib program.  That will be more a -- going into 2018, 2019. The reason for our ASK1 inhibitor to choose F3 and F4 is really we believe that\'s, first and foremost, where the need is. They\'re sick people, sick patients. They have a lot of co-morbidities. And if you look at the median survival of an F4 patient, it\'s 5 years. That\'s the median survival. So these are patients who really are -- they\'re in bad shape. And we think with our anti-fibrotic, that\'s, first and foremost, what you should be addressing. I think the ACC is quite interesting and that potentially takes us into a slightly earlier population of the F2s and F3s and perhaps the potential to be combining. We have begun one study, it\'s an early Phase II study, just a small study of the FXR combined with the ASK1. So we really believe that we have a market-leading portfolio here, but I think we\'re very sensible and realistic about the way that we might enter NASH because it is a new disease. The payers are going to be saying, "Why are we funding this?" And I think we want the rationale based on patients who are really quite ill. Ying Huang So that\'s why you\'re focusing on the F3 and F4 patients? Kevin Young Correct, correct. Ying Huang Well, it\'s hard to imagine that I will not ask any question about business development or your M&A because that\'s what these folks really care about. So to the extent you can, Kevin, really, when you think about the long term strategy for Gilead going forward in terms of returning to the growth path, are you looking for an asset or assets that will bring long term growth? Or you\'d rather have some sort of assets that can bring some near term revenue and also earning accretion? Kevin Young Ying, I\'m very shocked by this question. I wasn\'t expecting this one. Sung Lee I know. Me, too. Kevin Young I wasn\'t expecting this one. We\'re really looking for long term science. We\'re being thoughtful. Some of you have said why we\'re not rushing in and almost any deal is a good deal. We don\'t believe that philosophy at Gilead. We want to be thoughtful. We want products or platforms that provide really good science that put you in a scientific leadership type of position. I think we\'re looking across the board. We have indicated that we have interest in oncology, hematology, but we\'re not exclusively looking just in that disease setting. So we want something that is sustainable, that has a very long runway and is really not just about a short term fix. Ying Huang So you mentioned oncology. Because you guys have been always focusing on infectious disease or liver disease, if you look at the product lineup. Some of the investors are wondering, does Gilead have the internal expertise to take on a big risk in oncology? And I was wondering what your thoughts would be around that. Kevin Young There are -- there\'s probably more oncology background in Gilead than people know. We have done some hiring recently to supplement that. We have, I think, some good science around our targeted therapies, the Syk inhibitor. So we have been doing some testing and some studies in the hematological malignancies, BTK, Syk inhibitor. So perhaps, I think, we\'ve got more scientific knowledge than we\'re given credit to. But Gilead, you know we\'ve reinvented ourselves a few times. We\'re good at reinventing ourselves. And where I think what separates Gilead is once we have been thoughtful and once we decide to make a move, we have a lot of courage and we commit. Ying Huang Definitely. If there\'s one key takeaway message you want to drive home with audience investors here in this room and also on the webcast, what would that be, Kevin? Kevin Young I think Gilead is a strong company. I think we\'re going to build upon our heritage in HIV in the coming years. 3 or 4 years ago, a lot of people question the longevity of our HIV franchise. I think we\'re really in good shape. HCV is still a big business. It\'s changing, but it\'s still a big business for us. I think we have an emerging pipeline of very interesting assets. We haven\'t had time to talk about filgotinib, but we\'re committed to inflammation. I think the landscape has changed recently around the JAK inhibitors which is advantageous to us. And we\'re committed to finding complementary assets that fit our science. And you have a management team that\'s tried and tested and has longevity and we\'re in this for a long, long journey at Gilead. Ying Huang Great. Thanks very much for your time.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Q - Ying Huang So maybe, why don\'t we start from maybe HIV side of your business, Kevin. First of all, we\'re expecting the Phase III data from bictegravir in HIV midyear. What is your expectation of the results based on what you saw from the Phase II trial? And how critical is this molecule in terms of gaining back your share of keeping your leadership in HIV, especially considering what happened from dolutegravir introduced by GSK? Kevin Young So to thank you for the question, Ying. Thank you for the invitation. We\'re delighted to be here. I would just say very quickly we\'re pleased with the start of the year for Gilead. I think some very solid HCV numbers, thrilled by the uptake of our TAF-based regimens in HIV. And I\'m sure we\'ll come to it, some very nice progress in our pipeline. Specifically to your question, as we\'ve publicly announced, we will have results from the bic/F/TAF studies in this quarter in Q2. And then our hope would be, subject everything being okay, to put our registration in the third quarter. Typically, we can turn around our HIV programs very quickly and put in our regulatory submissions. As we said, the studies, particularly the 2 primary studies which are the comparative studies, 600 patients in each studies, they\'re non-inferiority studies. We would be very pleased to get those non-inferiority endpoints. That would be a positive for us and I think it would put us in a very good competitive situation. What we like about bic/F/TAF, bictegravir F/TAF, is that we see it as really a combination of 2 very good worlds, where you\'ve got an unboosted integrate inhibitor. Integrate inhibitors now are the primary preferred third agent and then you have the strength of a preferred backbone in TAF. And as you\'ve seen from Genvoya, the uptake of TAF is going exceedingly, exceedingly well, both here and the United States and now momentum very much building in Europe. So it\'s a very important launch for us. We think it\'s great. We think it\'s great for patients. We will be putting an incredible amount of energy. We know HIV very, very well as you all know, so it\'s important. It\'s important to us. But let me say that we really now have a family of TAF-based products and Genvoya is part of that. Descovy is part of that. Odefsey is part of that. And of course, bic/F/TAF is going to be, we believe, very, very additive to that. Some of that is conversion of existing regimens for Gilead and some of it actually is taking business away from the competition. About 10% of Genvoya comes from other regimens right now and so it\'s very additive to us. Ying Huang Thank you, Kevin. So as you mentioned, the TAF-containing regimens grew about 44% in first quarter compared to fourth quarter 2016. Do you think the pace of growth will continue to increase or stabilize at this pace in the next few quarters? And then if you look at the marketplace, what are the main drivers of that switch or commercial success? Kevin Young I definitely think that our TAF-based regimens, primarily Genvoya here in the United States, is a little bit different in the European markets, but primarily Genvoya here will continue to grow I think very impressively. It\'s really based on the population of HIV patients. I was looking at data recently and you\'ve got half of HIV patients in the United States are over the age of 50. And physicians want to be kinder from a bone point of view, from a renal point of view and that\'s the profile of TAF. So it\'s really hitting, I think, the right target from the point of view of the patients that we\'re treating. It\'s basically the same in Europe. Countries are at different staggered places in their launch. We\'ve already got 60% of HIV Gilead prescriptions converted to TAF in Germany. Spain is going well. We just started in Italy and France. So we think the same can be reproduced in the European market, albeit that they\'re on a slightly different time frame. But it\'s really about older HIV patients and long term care. The latest statistics is that a 20 year old is likely to add another 50 years plus in terms of life expectancy from chronic HIV treatment. So you\'re talking about an aging population and that\'s where TAF is very applicable. Ying Huang So you mentioned the European marketplace. We know that you\'re expected to lose market exclusivity for Viread and also Truvada in second half in Europe. What do you think the impact will be in the European marketplace? Do you think that will create negative pricing pressure on your branded franchise in Europe with that introduction of generics? Kevin Young It\'s a good question. So what Ying is bringing up is that, yes, we will be losing our European patent on TDF. We\'ve already lost our FTC patent in Europe. So the effect that we\'ll see will be on Viread, Truvada and Atripla. But of course, if you like, they are older products because the markets are converting into TAF-based regimens. Descovy -- by the way, Descovy is very important in Europe. Some of the markets didn\'t -- haven\'t adopted single tablets quite as much as United States, so Descovy, Odefsey and Genvoya. So it\'ll be a country-by-country introduction of the generics and those markets will have different proportions of TAF adoption at the time when the generics come to market. So we think, yes, there will be an effect. But in the long term, we will ride out that effect, again by the launch of our TAF-based regimens. Let me say again that TAF is the preferred regimen in guidelines. Once you have reimbursement in your European markets and like any pharmaceutical, you go through rigorous negotiations. But once you have reimbursement, then the physicians can make the choice. In France, in Italy, in Spain, they can make the choice. And in HIV, they follow guidelines extensively. And those guidelines are preferring TAF. In fact, the IAS guidelines, the International AIDS Society guidelines downgraded TDF. It\'s not a preferred regimen now. It\'s not a preferred molecule, so that encourages physicians to be using TAF. So I think we\'ll see country by country a little bit of a mix of the effect of the loss of exclusivity on TDF. Ying Huang Great. So even with the commercial success of Tivicay or Triumeq by GSK, still most of U.S.-based physicians do not really like the abacavir component of the single-tablet regimen from GSK. And then GSK is also testing a so-called doublet which is dolutegravir plus 3TC here. So how competitive do you think that regimen could be? And the simplified doublet, would that actually gain some more this year in the U.S.? Kevin Young So you\'re right. I think there\'s always been a question mark about abacavir and it didn\'t surprise us that our competition decided to remove that from a triple regimen. Let me say here and now that we\'re not doing any form of double combinations. We\'re very committed to triple therapy. We believe it\'s the way to go. It\'s the standard of care. We\'re very comfortable. The size of the tablets of bic/F/TAF will be very, very small because the dosage, the milligrams or the components are very, very low, so we\'re very comfortable with that. We believe that we\'ve come so far in HIV. Why go backwards? I think it\'s interesting, Ying, that the studies that have been tested with these sort of pairs of antivirals have viral load cutoffs. And that -- frankly that -- I think that worries Gilead. I think that probably would worry the HIV community. Again, if you look at guidelines and you look at the preferred regimens in guidelines, they don\'t have any viral load cutoff. And I think it\'s potentially confusing and potentially worrisome that you\'d have to be thinking about the viral load of the patient if you\'re initiating therapy. So we\'re very comfortable with our triple therapies. And again, subject to the data, we think bic/F/TAF is a great combination. Ying Huang So obviously, Genvoya is already a great medication for HIV. If you compare the bic/F/TAF to Genvoya, what is the advantage here in terms of clinical benefit? Because I know it\'s a little too early or premature to talk about. But still, Genvoya, I think, loses patent production around 2025. Sung Lee 2029. Ying Huang \'29. Sung Lee Yes. Ying Huang So at that point, what is the driver for a physician to use the bic/F/TAF versus Genvoya if it\'s a great medication already? Kevin Young Well, I think you\'re looking a long way out, Ying. I try to live in the here and now. And very much the -- if you like, the next 5 years where I think the opportunities are tremendous for Gilead. I think everything we\'ve heard from our advisers is an unboosted integrase on the backbone of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide is a really, really good combination. Ying Huang Do you have anything to add, Sung? Sung Lee Also, fewer drug-drug interactions potentially with an older population, so that would be an advantage as well. Ying Huang Okay. Kevin Young But I think perhaps to your question, I think Genvoya, there are going to be patients who are very, very happy on Genvoya and stay on Genvoya even when we launch bic/F/TAF. Ying Huang So I guess we should switch gears a little bit to your HCV business now. In the first quarter, it seems that we\'re seeing a somewhat stabilizing trend. I know it\'s a little bit premature to talk about that. But still, how do you see that business evolving in terms of pricing trend, in terms of identifying and also treating those new patients as well as the competitive dynamics with the Merck introduction of Zepatier and then the upcoming competition from the G/P once-daily, single-tablet regimen from AbbVie? Kevin Young I think it\'s about five questions there, Ying. I\'ll try and let me try... Ying Huang Well, because I\'m very [indiscernible] I always say it\'s one question for everybody. So I\'m trying to pack a 5-part question. Kevin Young Sung can help me on -- if my memory goes on the fourth or fifth question. Yes, let me go to the dynamics. We really try to be, I think, thoughtful, realistic, objective in the way we put out our guidance and gave you a lot of information, gave you the insights that we really have. We still believe whilst this is a very attractive market, hepatitis C is declining. And 1 quarter is not a trend. I -- we still believe that there will be a declining number of patients and the guidance we put out for the U.S. is what we\'re currently standing by. There is a different population of patients now being treated. They\'re less sick. They\'re relatively new to physicians. Physicians have followed their hepatitis C patients for a long time. Often, they failed or they were just monitoring the progress. And of course, they mobilized in 2014, particularly 2015.  This has mobilized in wanting to treat those patients. So we\'re seeing a different profile. Patients that haven\'t had previous therapy, their fibrosis score is a lot lower. So it\'s a different type of patient. In terms of pricing, we have not seen a -- we\'ve not really seen a change this year. A little bit change in the mix in the first quarter between Epclusa and Harvoni. I think we\'re coming through the Epclusa sort of mini warehouse. It\'s -- Epclusa has proved to be a great addition to our HCV offering in the -- particular in the genotype-2 and genotype-3 patients. So it\'s done really, really well. But there was a little bit of a -- that declined a bit and so that was sort of a mix change between Harvoni and Epclusa. We have built in the effect of competition, as you know, in our guidance. What they\'re going to do in the second half of this year remains to be seen, but we still really, really believe that we have the best offering in our sofosbuvir-based regimens. Harvoni in the genotype 1, half the patients are treated within 8 weeks today; Epclusa for the genotype 2 and 3. And we hope in early August that we\'ll have SOF/VEL/VOX approved for the failure for the resistant patients. Small group, but we think it\'s the right thing to do for hepatitis C. Did I leave anything out, Sung? Sung Lee I think you\'ve got it covered. Ying Huang So you have been doing so-called direct-to-consumer or DTC, campaign. How effective has that campaign been so far in terms of helping you identify and, diagnose these new patients? Kevin Young Maybe I can answer that and perhaps a slightly bigger picture in terms of the investments that we make in hepatitis C. A lot of people have asked, "Are you going to suddenly sort of almost decrease all your investments in hepatitis C?" No, that\'s not the case. It\'s still a very, very big and important part of Gilead. We have incredibly efficient size of field force in our general educational support. But the one thing that we have supported quite strongly is direct to the consumer, as you say, Ying. There\'s 2 parts to that. There is the educational advertising that we do around baby boomers and the need to be tested. And interestingly, we actually have seen a little tick-up in the amount of HCV testing that\'s been taking place since we put the baby boomer advertisement out there. And then the other part of it and it\'s what we do more from a weighted point of view, is the Harvoni actual branded. So that\'s where if you have hepatitis C, you should go in and ask your physician about Harvoni. And we just launched a brand-new campaign. It\'s called Let Go, so really let go of your hepatitis C. And that really has -- does support patients going in and asking for Harvoni as a brand. So we\'ll use both of those during the year and we\'ll modulate. We tend to cycle and modulate, but they are quite effective. Ying Huang And then maybe we can talk about also the long term market of HCV. I know you probably don\'t want to make a prediction for the future yet. And do you think, Kevin, there\'s any different dynamics between the U.S. market and the international market for HCV? Kevin Young Yes. We\'ve got -- let me try and talk about the 3 sort of segments, the 3 large segments of the world. The U.S., people want to try and peg when we\'ll see equilibrium or a turning point. I honestly don\'t think we\'ll know that until we\'ve gone past it. I think we\'ll see that almost in the rearview mirror. I think we\'ll probably see that settling probably 9 months after it actually happens. So is it happening right now? We don\'t think it is right now. We still think it\'s got -- we got a while before we find that sort of equilibrium. Europe is obviously staggered. So you\'ve got different countries at different stages of treatment. Germany is very much like the U.S. now. They\'re treating F0s to F2s, so they are very advanced. They\'ve gone through their patients. Italy is still treating F3s and F4s. France has just opened up the F2 patients to be treated, so you\'ve always got kind of a staggered effect. Finally, Japan. Japan is a remarkable effect. The peak of treatment which was the fourth quarter in 2015 in Japan, they were treating as many patients as a whole of Europe. Such is the problem. But they\'ve come over the other side and treatment has dropped off. A lot of the patients in Japan are over the age of 80, so there\'s always a question mark about treating them. Are they -- should they be treated? Are they physically fit? But we\'re doing our part. We\'re trying to get the message of treatment into the more peripheral centers in Japan and we actually do -- we\'re actually doing educational direct-to-the-consumer television advertising in Japan to try and alert that there are treatments and good outcomes. Ying Huang Okay, great. We just saw that the House passed a so-called repeal and replace bill. And we don\'t know the fate of this bill in the Senate. But hypothetically, if it does get passed and when they repeal the ObamaCare with the new healthcare regime, so what could be the potential impact on the Gilead business because you do have quite a lot of exposure to the government payers in both your HCV and HIV business? Kevin Young That\'s a great question, Ying. About -- it\'s interesting. The HCV is almost the opposite of the HIV. About 55% of HCV is in the private and about 45% is in the public. It\'s the reverse for HIV. It\'s sort of the 45% is in the private and 55% is in the public. What is going to happen? I\'m sure there -- I\'m sure I\'m no different from anybody else in this room. We\'ll just have to see how this unfolds. The one thing I would say is that HIV is generally, I would say almost always, had bipartisan support. If you think about the Ryan White CARE Act and the ADAP program, that\'s always had across-the-aisle support to making sure that HIV patients have good access. So I think whether it\'s Republican, Democrat, perhaps new legislation, I think HIV, again, as I\'ve said earlier, we\'ve come so far. I don\'t think we want to jeopardize the stability of well-controlled patients and doing something -- we\'re really doing well now about trying to address infection rates, whether it\'s treatments as a way of reducing infection rates or whether it be PrEP. And I think we certainly found in our life at Gilead, 30 years, that we\'ve -- irrespective of political party, people embrace the need to do the right thing in HIV. Ying Huang Okay. That\'s fair. So maybe we should switch gears to the NASH program. Couple of questions here, Kevin. Number one, how do you see the commercial opportunity in this market which obviously has been untapped for a long time because we don\'t have an FDA-approved therapy? And then secondly, given the Phase II data you guys generate in the ASK1 program, how do you think that compound will address the market? Obviously, you\'re trying to focus on the so-called cirrhotic or F4 NASH patients. Kevin Young Yes. Just as a recap, we\'ve got 3 assets in NASH. We\'re excited about them all. We think we have a very good array of mechanisms that we\'re approaching NASH from several angles. First and foremost, we got the anti-fibrotic, our ASK1 inhibitor. That\'s now in Phase III testing. Two studies that are called STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4. That\'s F3 and F4, so that\'s the more advanced patient. I\'ll come back to why. And then we\'ve got our ACC which is in Phase II testing. And also our FXR which is also in Phase II testing. So I think we\'re in a really nice position. And I think certainly for the Phase IIs, back end of this year, we\'ll have more news. Recruitments going nicely in our Phase IIIs and no news this year, really, from that -- from selonsertib program.  That will be more a -- going into 2018, 2019. The reason for our ASK1 inhibitor to choose F3 and F4 is really we believe that\'s, first and foremost, where the need is. They\'re sick people, sick patients. They have a lot of co-morbidities. And if you look at the median survival of an F4 patient, it\'s 5 years. That\'s the median survival. So these are patients who really are -- they\'re in bad shape. And we think with our anti-fibrotic, that\'s, first and foremost, what you should be addressing. I think the ACC is quite interesting and that potentially takes us into a slightly earlier population of the F2s and F3s and perhaps the potential to be combining. We have begun one study, it\'s an early Phase II study, just a small study of the FXR combined with the ASK1. So we really believe that we have a market-leading portfolio here, but I think we\'re very sensible and realistic about the way that we might enter NASH because it is a new disease. The payers are going to be saying, "Why are we funding this?" And I think we want the rationale based on patients who are really quite ill. Ying Huang So that\'s why you\'re focusing on the F3 and F4 patients? Kevin Young Correct, correct. Ying Huang Well, it\'s hard to imagine that I will not ask any question about business development or your M&A because that\'s what these folks really care about. So to the extent you can, Kevin, really, when you think about the long term strategy for Gilead going forward in terms of returning to the growth path, are you looking for an asset or assets that will bring long term growth? Or you\'d rather have some sort of assets that can bring some near term revenue and also earning accretion? Kevin Young Ying, I\'m very shocked by this question. I wasn\'t expecting this one. Sung Lee I know. Me, too. Kevin Young I wasn\'t expecting this one. We\'re really looking for long term science. We\'re being thoughtful. Some of you have said why we\'re not rushing in and almost any deal is a good deal. We don\'t believe that philosophy at Gilead. We want to be thoughtful. We want products or platforms that provide really good science that put you in a scientific leadership type of position. I think we\'re looking across the board. We have indicated that we have interest in oncology, hematology, but we\'re not exclusively looking just in that disease setting. So we want something that is sustainable, that has a very long runway and is really not just about a short term fix. Ying Huang So you mentioned oncology. Because you guys have been always focusing on infectious disease or liver disease, if you look at the product lineup. Some of the investors are wondering, does Gilead have the internal expertise to take on a big risk in oncology? And I was wondering what your thoughts would be around that. Kevin Young There are -- there\'s probably more oncology background in Gilead than people know. We have done some hiring recently to supplement that. We have, I think, some good science around our targeted therapies, the Syk inhibitor. So we have been doing some testing and some studies in the hematological malignancies, BTK, Syk inhibitor. So perhaps, I think, we\'ve got more scientific knowledge than we\'re given credit to. But Gilead, you know we\'ve reinvented ourselves a few times. We\'re good at reinventing ourselves. And where I think what separates Gilead is once we have been thoughtful and once we decide to make a move, we have a lot of courage and we commit. Ying Huang Definitely. If there\'s one key takeaway message you want to drive home with audience investors here in this room and also on the webcast, what would that be, Kevin? Kevin Young I think Gilead is a strong company. I think we\'re going to build upon our heritage in HIV in the coming years. 3 or 4 years ago, a lot of people question the longevity of our HIV franchise. I think we\'re really in good shape. HCV is still a big business. It\'s changing, but it\'s still a big business for us. I think we have an emerging pipeline of very interesting assets. We haven\'t had time to talk about filgotinib, but we\'re committed to inflammation. I think the landscape has changed recently around the JAK inhibitors which is advantageous to us. And we\'re committed to finding complementary assets that fit our science. And you have a management team that\'s tried and tested and has longevity and we\'re in this for a long, long journey at Gilead. Ying Huang Great. Thanks very much for your time.

Good afternoon. And welcome to the Q4 and Year End 2015 Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to the company's Senior Director of Investor Relations, Kristi Bonner. Kristi, please go ahead. Kristi Bonner Thank you, Operator. Welcome, everyone. Today's press release is available on our website at www.keuriggreenmountain.com. With me today are CEO, Brian Kelley; and CFO, Pete Leemputte. We'll lead off today's call with a review of our fiscal fourth quarter performance and our forward outlook, and then we'll move on to Q&A. In an effort to get to as many analyst questions as possible within the hour, we request that you limit your questions to two. I'll remind everyone that certain statements will be made today which are forward-looking within the meaning of securities laws. Given the uncertainties of forward-looking statements, our actual results may differ materially from anything projected in these forward-looking statements. We can give no assurance as to their accuracy and we assume no obligation to update them. For further information on risks and uncertainties, please read the company's SEC filings and the paragraph in today's press release that begins with the words certain information. And now, I'll turn the call over to Brian Kelley. Brian Kelley Thank you, Kristi, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our 2015 financial results, followed by comments on current market conditions and our outlook for 2016, before Pete provides further details on the numbers. I will then wrap-up with a few comments on 2016 priorities. Looking at the big picture, our results for the quarter and for the year reflect the competitive and dynamic marketplace in which we are operating, and the steps we're taking to position our company for the future. We are making progress in our cost reduction efforts and we continue to generate strong cash flows. And while market conditions are challenging in the near-term, we are confident we are taking the right actions to position our company for longer-term growth and shareholder value creation. For the fourth quarter we generated revenues within our guidance range and earnings came in above the range we estimated in our last call at $0.85 per share, on the benefits of our cost reduction efforts, as well as a lower effective tax rate. Free cash flow for fiscal year 2015 was above our guidance at $344 million. Importantly, free cash flow for our hot business grew $200 million year-over-year. Our goal is to continually proactively manage the business to maximize cash flow efficiency in order to build on this momentum. We continue to return substantial cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. From our third quarter earnings report to today weve repurchased $350 million worth of common shares. In addition, we announced this afternoon that our Board increased the dividend by 13% to an annualized rate of a $1.30 per share. These actions reflect our confidence in the strong cash flow generation capacity of the company and our commitment to return capital to shareholders. As we highlighted on our last earnings call, we continue to see a competitive and dynamic marketplace, resulting in some near-term challenges in our business as we continue, the Keurig Brewer transition, as well as increasing competitive activity in pods. While we expect that some of these headwinds will continue into 2016, we are focused on executing against the solid holiday season plan that we believe will better position us for the future. In addition, we continue to rationalize our infrastructure to the current demand environment, highlighted by our three-year $300 million productivity initiative. We continue to expect to realize about $100 million in savings in 2016. Now I'd like to review some of the key factors impacting results and our forward outlook. Based on our latest surveys and models we estimate that the U.S. at-home installed base of active single-serve brewers grew by 8% in 2015 to just over 21 million appliances. While installed base growth remains quite healthy, the rate of growth slowed in 2015. Now its important to note that in general not all brewers we shipped end up increasing our active installed base. This is because retailers hold a certain amount of inventory, consumers can return a brewer, they might replace an existing appliance or in some cases the appliance is never used at all. In previous years we generally saw from 45% to 50% of U.S. at-home shipments contribute to growth in the installed base. During 2015 that rate came in significantly below that 40% to 50% due to a number of factors. First was the weak holiday season last year, specifically lower consumer purchases means fewer new and incremental users. Second, there were greater replacements of existing Keurig Brewers. Our consumers are very loyal to our brand and some wanted to switch to the latest technology. A trade up doesnt increase our installed base number. We expect that this factor by itself would diminish over time. Third, the average life of a brewer is between three to four years. We are now seeing the anniversary of strong appliance unit sales from prior years, leading to a larger absolute number of replacements in installed base during 2015. Fourth, we saw an increase in the return rate as compared to prior years due primarily to consumer confusion with pod compatibility, particularly early on in fiscal 2015 with the launch of 2.0. We believe this initial launch factor will have a more limited impact in 2016 with improved communication and packaging, and with the recent re-launch of the Keurig My K-Cup. Finally, the MINI product action had more of an impact than we originally expected. Additional research has shown that some consumers are more likely to enter the single-serve category at a lower price point more in line with our MINI product offering. With the MINI in very limited distribution as a result of the product action we took and the K200 not launching until late spring, we simply didn't have a strong low price product lineup during the first half of our fiscal year. Looking ahead, we enter the 2015 holiday season in a much stronger position. We have a broader portfolio of brewer models across more price points, with stronger offerings in the key sub $100 category. The MINI brewer is back in broad distribution and we have reduced its price to $79 to drive adoption with consumers looking for Keurig convenience and quality in a lower priced offering. Our small footprint K200 entry level 2.0 Brewer is also available this holiday season in a variety of colors with strong promotional plans. The K200 has been quite well-received by consumers and has average ratings above Four stars. This model has exceeded our initial expectations and is now the highest volume Keurig Brewer sold in the single-serve marketplace. We will continue to offer our premium models for consumers looking for a larger reservoir and more features. On the marketing front, our new advertising campaign Your Favorites. Your Way. kicked off in October. The campaign leverages the life-stage strategy. It demonstrates the benefit of single serve versus drip coffee to consumers as they move into their first apartment, become parents or move to a new city. The campaign is multiplatform with television spots across multiple dayparts including nine of the top 10 ranked primetime shows. We also have a strong digital campaign including custom programs with Hulu and Yahoo! Additionally, we are continuing to message the variety and choice in the Keurig System on the box and through in-store marketing. Importantly, we are delivering both increased effectiveness and productivity in our marketing investment as a result of consolidating our media agencies earlier in fiscal 2015. Looking at fiscal 2016, we expect that the actions we're taking will lead to some recovery in the percentage of our U.S. At Home shipments that contribute to an increased brewer installed base. While strong unit volume growth in the past three to four years will continue to impact the number of deactivations, we also expect to see lower price points in both MINI and the K200 to bring new consumers into the single-serve category. In addition, the relaunch of My K-Cup gives consumers the ability to brew all their favorite beverages in the Keurig System. Our current expectation is that the U.S. At Home installed base will grow in the mid-to-high single digits in fiscal 2016. There's been some concern noted by the overall marketplace in recent weeks about the strength of consumer spending this holiday season. While we, of course, are not immune to overall market trends, we believe in an improving mix of new consumers to the Keurig single-serve coffee platform to help mitigate any impact from weaker economic growth. More broadly despite the current environment, we do believe that our core hot platform has plenty of white space to drive longer term growth. We remain the category leader in single serve with an installed base thats growing. And we fully expect single serve to continue gaining share of total coffeemakers over time. Turning to pods. Lower brewer installed base growth in fiscal 2015 as well as excess capacity at other pod manufacturers created challenging category dynamics, which we continue to experience in the fourth quarter. Volume growth in U.S. measured channels was 13% in the quarter. We continue to see weakness in the specialty and digital channels bringing total U.S. At Home category growth in the quarter to approximately 7%. Against that 7% growth in pod consumption, our total pod shipments declined 4% in the quarter with U.S. At Home volumes down 3% as we faced a difficult shipment comparison year-over-year. Notably we typically see a build in channel pod inventories during our fiscal fourth quarter as colder temperatures become the norm when the holiday season approaches. The heavy built last year was attributed in part to the pre-ordering by customers in advance of our SAP implementation, which started in early 2014. After further analysis, we also believe there were additional factors at work in the fourth quarter of 2014. Including the need for new partners to the Keurig system to build their in-house inventory, some pre-buying ahead of our November price increase and retailers planning for a big holiday on the 2.0 system. As a result of all these factors, we believe the 7% growth in retail demand for pods in the fourth quarter of 2015 is the best measure of underlying performance of the category. For 2016, we are focusing -- forecasting U.S. At Home pod volumes to grow in line with installed base growth. Pod pricing remains competitive as other pod manufacturers have excess capacity. We have also seen downward price pressure on the part of other brands in the marketplace which may be due in part to coffee prices where the C price has fallen by about 40% in the past year. As I mentioned on our last call, weve seen a mix shift this year away from owned and licensed brands which continued in the fourth quarter. This was expected as we brought previously unlicensed brands into our system and expanded our partnership with Dunkin' Donuts. You'll recall that prior to 2015, Dunkin had previously sold K-Cups in the retail outlets only. But this popular brand is now fully available in broad distribution. We will continue to manage our pod businesses as a portfolio supporting both, our owned and licensed brands, as well as those of our partners. Recent innovation on our owned brands includes Green Mountain Organics, Green Mountain Coffeehouse beverages and Laughing Man which are all available on Keurig.com and are in the process of expanding retail distribution throughout 2016. In terms of partner brands, we added Community Coffee, Reily Foods and illy while starting to transition the Kraft brands into our system in addition to the Dunkin expansion. The strength of the Keurig System has always been the variety, choice and convenience we provide to consumers. And its these very facts that we believe will continue to drive long-term growth in both brewers and pods. Turning to an update on Keurig KOLD. In terms of cold, we are pleased to launch the product this fall. These are very early days and we caution that 2016 will be a year of launch and learn. This is the exciting new technology and we intend to test different methods of marketing, both retail and digital, as well as pricing during the upcoming year to guide us as we build this new category and this new technology. We believe that experiencing the excitement of the system and the fresh cold taste of the beverages is critical to driving consumer acceptance. As a result, you'll see us staff for live demos and retail stores in malls as well as build awareness with mobile vans and pop-up destinations with our Keurig KOLD Kube. What that means in terms of numbers, sales for the first 12 months of the launch will likely be in the range of 60,000 to 100,000 units based on what we see today. Our early read from consumers is positive on the taste profile of the beverage for both our partner brands and our new owned brands. Rita's & Tina's and Union Street Lounge cocktail mixers have just launched on Keurig.com adding to our portfolio of craft and fountain-style sodas, zero and low calorie flavored filters and waters, sports hydration drinks and ice teas. We've always viewed Keurig KOLD as our long-term multiphase rollout. It is very early in the launch and were taking the time necessary to learn from retailers and consumers to maximize the opportunity for long-term success. We expect to continually improve the appliance, its footprint and price point over time and our development efforts on those fronts continue. But we will be disciplined and pragmatic in our approach to investment levels over the long term and we will invest only as marketplace success dictates. With that, Ill pass this call over to Pete. Pete Leemputte Thanks Brian. Im glad to be here and look forward to working with our shareholders and the investment community in my new role at Keurig. Ill start with some details on the fourth quarter before turning my attention to our outlook for 2016 and then wrap up with some comments on our balance sheet and free cash flow. Please note that the numbers I referenced will largely be our non-GAAP figures unless otherwise noted. You can reference our press release for full reconciliation with the GAAP results. So turning to the quarter, we generated net sales of $1.04 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 and within the range detailed in our last conference call. Excluding currency impacts, sales were lower by 11%. The stronger dollar added a further 2% to the decline and reported sales were up by 13%. Brewer and accessory sales were down 32% with pod sales down 9%. Let me highlight some of the most important drivers of fourth quarter sales starting with brewers. Brewer volumes were 20% lower than 2014 in line with our expectations. Volumes were impacted by retailer inventory fluctuations. We are comparing against the retail selling associated with the Keurig 2.0 launch in the prior year, along with continuing efforts to clear access brewer inventory at retail this year. Partially offsetting is the MINI product action, which reduce sales in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition to volumes, mix reduced brewer sales by 10%, driven by the lower price K200 model and greater unit sales of the MINI brewer. It's important to note that the K200 launch during the spring of 2015 and was not included in the 2014 retail selling for the 2.0. And the MINI brewer had an elevated impact on mix in the fourth quarter of 2015 as were comparing against the sales reserve taken for the product action in the prior year quarter. As we move through 2016, we expect that brewer mix will improve noticeably from this fourth quarter level, particularly as we compare against the growing MINI and K200 volumes seen during the second half of 2015. Finally, brewer pricing in the fourth declined by 1% and foreign exchange negatively impacted brewer sales by 1 additional percentage point. We intend to have a heavier mix of promotional support for brewers during the 2015 holiday season and reduce the price of the MINI. Lower brewer pricing will therefore be much more pronounced in the first quarter of 2016 than the level seen in the fourth quarter of 2015. Keep in mind that the promotion investments along with the stronger product lineup at lower price points is targeted to bring new and incremental users into our installed base. Turning the pods, the sales declined of 9% in the quarter was composed of a 4% lower volumes and a 6% decrease in mix. This was partially offset by a 2% increase in net pricing. Foreign exchange negatively impacted pod sales by 2%. Its clear that the fourth quarter volume comparison versus 2014 was impacted by retailers ordering pods more aggressively last year ahead of our SAP implementation. But as Brian noted, we believe that the retailer loading went beyond the SAP implementation, with additional channel builds for the 2.0 launch and for the price increase we took last November, and for the new and expanding brands coming into the Keurig system. As a result, we believe that the 7% growth in consumer demand for pods in the U.S. at-home marketplace during the fourth quarter is the best metrics reviewing the health of the category and our pod business. In 2016, we expect pod volume growth to track the mid to high single-digit increase in our brewer installed base. Finally, note the away from home pod environment remains competitive, with volume declines in the low-teens during the quarter. Unfavorable mix for our owned and licensed brands reduce pod sales by about 6% in the fourth quarter, a better trend than that 8% mix impact seen in the third quarter of 2015. You may recall we started to bring in new partners to the Keurig system in a meaningful way during the fourth quarter of 2014. So the year-over-year mix comparisons have started to ease somewhat as a result. Note that our partner expansion continued into the second half of 2015 when Dunkin' Donuts broader retail distribution took hold. So the mix pact arising for new entrance to the Keurig system will remain a bit unfavorable until we get into the second half of 2016. Additionally, our shipment mix could also be influenced by share changes at retail. Pricing actions by competitors could result in higher or lower share for our owned and licensed brands in 2016. Well obviously be watching this closely. Turning to profitability, non-GAAP gross margin was down 300 basis points in the quarter, with higher coffee cost accounting for almost three quarter of the decline versus 2014. On a sequential basis looking forward, we expect that coffee costs reflected in our cost of goods sold will remain at this high level during the first quarter of 2016, before starting to decline in the second quarter with a more noticeable drop in the second half of 2016. On a full year basis, we will see a slight benefit from lower coffee costs in 2016 compared to 2015. The second factor influencing our non-GAAP gross margins in the fourth quarter and accounting for one quarter of decline versus the prior year is an $8.6 million obsolescence charge or $0.04 per share for the write-down of our inventory of both commercial brewers. Please note that non-GAAP gross profit excludes a $24 million non-cash pretax charge related to both in other packaging lines. On a full year basis, obsolescence charges reduced non-GAAP gross margins by 160 basis points or almost $0.30 per share in 2015 versus 2014. While brewer obsolescence was one key factor, a significant portion of these charges came from pods as well. We have started an important effort toward reducing pod obsolescence costs by tightening our management of inventories in order to limit product aging beyond its stated useful life among other actions. You can see that our year end inventory of pods is about 20% below the level seen in 2014. Not only how we generated enhanced cash flow from these actions, but we will also see a significant benefit to our bottomline through reduce obsolescence expense in 2016. Finally, I want to point out that we saw a favorable trend in sales returns for brewers in the fourth quarter, a first for 2015. This is the result of retailer mix and we believe the reflection of the four stars plus rating carried by our 200 brewer. We expect additional progress in fiscal 2016. Just to brief were done operating expenses. Non-GAAP SG&A declined 20% in the quarter or 120 basis points when measured as a percentage of sales, driven by lower marketing expense, headcount and variable incentive accruals. Note, that we are driving greater efficiency from our marketing investments through consolidation of our media agencies. Keep in mind that fourth quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense excludes $16 million in pretax restructuring charges related to our previously announced productivity program. These expenses are primarily employee severance costs and all but $4 million are expected to be cash expenditures. Looking at earnings per share, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.85 in the quarter above the range shared in our last conference call, with lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate as the key drivers. The $0.85 per share compares to $0.94 in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Ive already describe the key operational factors, but note we saw the benefit from a lower share base and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by the stronger dollar, which unfavorably impacted EPS by about $0.03. On a full year basis non-GAAP EPS of $3.56 compared to $3.97 in 2014. The fourth quarter effective tax rate or ETR came in at 32.3%, down from 35.2% in 2014. This is the result of non-recurring tax benefits related to the prior year returns that totaled about $0.04 per share. On a full year basis, the 2015 ETR stood at 33.6% versus 35.4% in the prior year. We currently expect the 2016 full year tax rate to range from 33% to 33.5% in 2016. Although, some quarter variability is to be expected. Turning to guidance, for fiscal 2016, we expect net sales on a constant currency basis to be flat to up in the low-single digits over fiscal 2015. We currently expect foreign currency exchange rates to negatively impact net sales growth by about 1%. Our non-GAAP earnings outlook is $3.25 to $3.45 per share. It includes an estimated unfavorable $0.16 impact from foreign currency based on current exchange rates. Key drivers that are expected to impact the range of outcomes on EPS are installed base growth, the competitive environment in pods, the pace of KOLD consumer adoption, as well as the rate at which we are able to scale KOLD pod production and finally, the level of share repurchase. Our revenue guidance is based on the following expectations. The U.S. at-home installed base growth in the mid to high-single digits. Lower average revenue per unit for brewers coming from a combination of product mix and in some cases lower pricing. As I mentioned earlier, we introduced the K200 entry level 2.0 Reservoir Brewer model in the second half of 2015 and we also expect stronger shipments on the MINI in 2016, as we lap last year's product action, both of which will impact mix. Brewer pricing will be impacted by the less price decrease on the MINI and promotional investments we have made on select models to further drive adoption. The pod marketplace remains competitive which effects pricing, particularly as we have significant coffee inflation relative to current spot price in the first half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect negative pod mix especially in the first half as we do not lap the Dunkin' Donuts expansion in pods to retail until the second half. On a full year basis, we expect to see a lower unfavorable impact from mix on our pod, sales growth than what we experienced in 2015. Gross margins in 2016 will have a number of puts and takes. We will see headwinds from a higher sales mix of 2.0 versus 1.0 Brewers, price investments on brewers and pods, and pod mix. KOLD is also expected to have an impact given that we are in the startup phase of the launch, with inefficiencies as we bring up new manufacturing lines. There are also some noticeable tailwinds as well, coffee costs are about 90% locked for 2016 and we will see slightly lower cost on a full year basis, but with significant variability by quarter, reduced obsolescence expenses and sales returns will also be positive and we've targeted approximately $100 million in productivity cost reductions, with savings more heavily weighted toward cost of goods sold versus SG&A. Key areas of focus, our manufacturing efficiency, lower distribution costs and increasing the effectiveness of our promotional programs and marketing spend. We expect our income statement investment in Keurig KOLD on a pretax basis to center around $125 million in 2016, compared to approximately $100 million in 2015, and it is dependent on consumer adoption of the platform, channel mix and pod manufacturing efficiencies. The majority of the 2016 investment relates to fixed costs, such as depreciation, research and development, plants startup, and sales and marketing launch costs. Remember that this is a long-term rollout which will likely see sales volatility from period-to-period. The introduction of Keurig KOLD is expected to positively impact revenue growth by less than 1 percentage point. Finally, our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a 33% to 33.5% tax rate and additional share repurchase. Given that we are managing the business on an annual basis, we will not be giving quarterly guidance moving forward. That being said, we will highlight key factors influencing quarterly trends as appropriate. Higher coffee cost will impact the first quarter by about $0.13 per share compared to the prior year. Investments in brewer promotional spend, a heavier mix of the K200 and the MINI, and a greater mix toward 2.0 versus 1.0 Brewers will also be additional factors experience in the first quarter. We expect noticeably higher non-GAAP EPS in the remaining three quarters of 2016, as lower coffee cost roll into our cost of goods sold and the Q1 seasonal mix shift away from heavier brewer sales. In addition, we expect lower obsolescence expense in the remaining quarters of 2016 and our productivity initiative should deliver greater savings. One last point on guidance, given the volatility and competitive dynamics we are continuing to see in our business, plus the investments we are making to drive longer-term growth, we believe it's prudent to solely we provide annual guidance metrics rather than a longer-term algorithm. It's important to know that our overriding goal is to reaccelerate revenue growth, maximize productivity and drive earnings growth and cash flow. And while we work through the transition issues we've discussed at length, we are committed to allocating significant capital to share repurchases and dividend growth. Wrapping up with some comments on our balance sheet and free cash flow, we were pleased that free cash flow of $344 million was above our guidance due to improve discipline around working capital, with both inventories and receivables coming in lower than forecast. Importantly, free cash flow for our core hot business was up approximately $200 million year-over-year and our goal is to continue managing the business to maximize cash flow efficiency. Capital expenditures for the year stood at $411 million with CapEx for our hot business at approximately 4% of sales, down from about 6% in fiscal 2014. We did an exceptional job at driving higher operating efficiencies on our pod manufacturing lines for our hot business that limited the need for additional manufacturing capacity. A little over half of our capital spending in 2015 was associated with manufacturing capacity for KOLD. My short time here its obvious there are opportunities for reduction in working capital. During 2015 we averaged 18.7% of sales invested in networking capital excluding cash, up from 13.2% in 2014. The higher appliances inventories we carried over from a week holiday season last year was a critical factor. And we have a long supply chain from Asia for our appliances. But there are opportunities across the board to free up cash flow for the company. We started to make progress in the fourth quarter but this will continue to be an important focus moving forward. We expect free cash flow to fall in the range of $420 million to $500 million in fiscal 2016. Capital spending is expected to fall in the range of $225 million to $275 million, down from $411 million in 2015 and significantly lower CapEx for KOLD. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to total about $290 million, up from $265 million in 2015. The increase in D&A is all attributed to depreciation. And this additional expense is reflected in our non-GAAP earnings. Our strong cash flow and balance sheet allows us to return significant cash to shareholders both in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Following a 15% increase in dividends for fiscal 2015, the board authorized an additional 13% increase to an annual dividend of the $1.30 per share for 2016. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $150 million in shares and continue to be active in the market following the close of our fiscal year. Since then we bought back an additional $235 million in common stock, bringing our total share repurchases post the third quarter earnings report to $350 million. This equates to 6.4 million shares or about 4% of our total shares outstanding at an average price of about $55 per share. We have $914 million left on our share repurchase authorization as of today. And we intend to be active in the market as we move through 2016. Before turning the call back to Brian, let me note that I accepted the CFO position at Keurig Green Mountain because of the opportunity I saw for value creation for shareholders and the role I might have in driving that. After three months on the job full-time, I'm more convinced than ever about potential. While our category continues to experience a tougher competitive environment, Keurig is the leading brand in single-serve coffee in North America. We have grown very quickly and as a result, there are real opportunities in a number of important areas including lower brewer costs, improved pod manufacturing productivity, greater efficiencies in our traded marketing spend and product innovation. While change always takes time, I'm delighted to be member of the Keurig team and will remain focused on that. Now Ill turn the call back to Brian to wrap up. Brian Kelley Thanks Pete. Fiscal year 2016 will be a transition period that will see Keurig invest in the business and proactively taking actions to reaccelerate profitable growth. Our priorities for the year are to first reinvigorate our hot system and continue to grow the installed base. Two, re-accelerate growth in pods. Three, prudently invest in KOLD to deeply understand the drivers of consumer adoption. Four, execute against our productivity plan and five, return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases while investing in the business. We continue to have confidence in the long-term outlook for the Keurig System and are committed to delivering long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you all for listening today and now I'd like to ask the operator to please open the line to questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will take our first question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane Hi. Good afternoon everyone. Brian Kelley Hi Bryan. Pete Leemputte Hi Bryan. Bryan Spillane Just two questions. The first one, just in terms of the FX effect that you are expecting on EPS is much greater than what youre expecting in terms of revenue growth. So could you just talk through just what it is thats affecting your operating income? I guess thats the first question. Pete Leemputte Sure. Bryan, the greatest exposure we have is obviously to the Canadian dollar and the revenue exposure is noticeable. But when you think of the incremental profit that's actually in Canadian dollars, keep in mind that both coffee and the brewers are dollar denominated so that tends to exacerbate the impact that you see in that market and thats the key reason for why its such a big factor. Were going to look at some additional ways of hedging that exposure than what we've done historically and thats going to be a key focus pretty early in the year. Bryan Spillane Okay. Thank you, Pete. And then Brian, just in terms of the sharper on price points on the brewers going into the holiday period, can you just talk to particularly with the MINI and the price point coming down as much as it is, why -- why was it -- was price really a gating factor in terms of getting new adoption or was it more the quality perception of the confusion issue. Im just trying to understand why we need to promote as aggressively to sort of bring consumers into the market. Is it just a matter of you got to grab their attention again and price is the best way to do it or was there something else in terms of your overall cost of the system that was the gating factor for people to adopt? Brian Kelley Bryan, I think there is really two separate issues going on, one the MINI returning in full distribution is a real help. And we've got new insight this year as the MINI went away as to exactly who the MINI brings into the system and it brings new users into the system. And thats the first thing. And while we knew that a bit, we didnt really see its impact until it went away. The My K-Cup is another factor that really helps bring new users in the system because they say, okay, I can continue to hold on to the bad coffee I have but I can also try a MINI at a fairly low price, less than $100. So I think the MINI is one factor. The other thing is that the price points we've reflected in K200 this holiday season and the K40 in this holiday season at certain customers is also really driving the same issue. Its -- we're realizing that the price point, weve said this for a bit now, the sub $100 price point is important to get new users. And then we want to have premium models where consumers can trade up and loyal Keurig users can step into models with better features and larger reservoirs. So we think thats the mix we want. We have the right brewer lineup now for the season. We have the right price points. We have the My K-Cup back. We don't have the 2.0 launch confusion that we faced last year. And we have lower return rates. So with that, were rolling into this holiday season. Bryan Spillane All right. Thanks Brian. Brian Kelley Sure. Thank you. Operator At this time, well take our next question from Steve Powers with UBS. Steve Powers Hey thanks. Thanks a lot. Actually -- so first a question for Pete if I could. So Pete, obviously getting a handle on where Keurig business will trend in the future has been difficult both for those on the inside and the outside of the company in 15. So as you step into your new role, I was wondering if you could just rate the degree of control over which you think you have visibility to forecast in your current role versus maybe what you experienced at Mead Johnson and to the extent the visibility is different, why is that and what you think it will take to close any gaps? What I think were all trying to assess essentially is the degree to which this new outlook is really firmly achievable or if there is more room for surprise and downside disappointment? Brian Kelley Its an excellent question. And I think sitting on the outside you could say, it should be better. I think once Ive been inside here most of the variability that we've seen and forecast isnt with our owned and licensed brands, thats with partners and recognize that in terms of their forecasting and what they're telling us they want us to manufacture for them and that has been where the variability has come in. Now it just so happens that I think too when you look at our mix, this was talked about throughout the last year, partners are an increasing piece of the overall volume that we manufacture, so that tends to I think exacerbate the issue as were doing our forecasting. That being said, I think there is some good opportunities here for better aligning forecast with partners. I know some of the new folks that have come in to run the U.S. business are putting a very, very high emphasis on that. And I think that we can do better but it will take a little bit of time to get there. Steve Powers Okay, okay. Thats fair. And then I guess Brian or Pete, if I could just shift to brewers, could you give us a sense for where you think channel inventories sat exiting 2015, especially on the original 2.0 SKUs the 300, 400, 500 series? And related to that do you still expect shipments will be positive in the first quarter versus last year? And I guess if I could just pile one more. As you rely -- this is kind of a follow-up to the earlier question, as you rely more and more on those low-price brewers to grow the installed base, what does that imply about the future attachment rate, the ability to maintain historical pricing and still grow, essentially is the quality of todays incremental household the same that it was in past? And do have data that people actually trade up from what you're labeling entry-level products to sort of higher end, presumably higher attachment rate better economic type products? Thanks. Pete Leemputte So Steve, Ill answer the first question with regard to the inventories in the channel. We believe that there were hundreds of thousands of excess brewers in the channel when the holiday season ended. And we had higher inventories too. So it was a significant factor, thats at the end of the first quarter. And what we've seen are lower shipments for the remaining three quarters of the year, which has affected our shipments and made some of the comparisons a bit tougher compared to the prior year. We think they are in better shape at this point in time whether theyre absolutely there or not will also be dependent on the holiday season for 2015. So I dont want to get too far ahead of ourselves in that front. And as for first quarter shipments for us, Id say, were very confident that we should see a higher retail sales for brewers compared to the prior year. The number of reasons for optimism there including the fact that all the pod compatibility issues that we were dealing with a year ago are largely behind us we believe, we got that four-star plus rating on the K200 that should help us as well. How that translates into our own shipment level will be dependent on the retailer inventory situation. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves and start to forecast that. But you won't -- I think one thing we can say for certain, you won't see the sort of volume drag that youve seen for the last three quarters for the company in terms of our shipments in the first quarter of 2016. Brian Kelley Let me address your second question about attachment rate. As with lower price brewers, it doesnt make a difference. Weve seen the only thing that drives attachment rate difference is the presence of a reservoir or non-reservoir brewer. So it's not necessarily a price point but what happens is a MINI and non-reservoir brewer tends to have a lower attachment rate than a reservoir brewer. So when we take and offer the K40 or the K200 at an attractive price, we don't see any change in attachment rate at all. The MINI now that its back will be more at normal levels for us. So we don't see lower price points in effect driving attachment rate lower. And we've not really seen that our attachment rate has been very steady because the second piece of the question was about really is the quality in installed base that comes in with a lower-brewer lower. Im going to answer that two ways, both are encouraging for us. First, we don't see that a lower price point consumer brew is less in fact in terms of pod consumption we see about the same. The other thing we would say as well, while the mix of the brand may differ. We don't see a difference in actual consumption of pods. So we've not seen a decrease or a change at all in the quality of the installed base. I think we are learning more and more how to target households that are heavy coffee households but we have a lot more to do to get that right and to be more precise with that. Weve much, much more to do on the marketing side and on the commercial side to make that right. So the attachment rate is if its fluctuated at the same level its fluctuated for the last number of years. And so we have not seen that yet but we would expect as we grow. Were going to have to grow the installed base. Were going to have to be more and more sharply focused on ensuring that the quality of the installed base we bring in is equally strong or even stronger. Steve Powers Great. Thanks. Good luck. Brian Kelley Thanks, Steve. Operator And moving forward, we will hear from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First for Pete, can you elaborate a little bit on your first impressions and priorities are, as you comment what youve learned, especially in light of what youve heard from investors, maybe you can comment on some of the misconceptions out there. Pete Leemputte Sure. First, Im here because I think its a great company with great people and that really stuck with me. And frankly, Ive told Brian as Ive intended to retire and this opportunity came along. And I really like the strategy of the company and I do see single serve as the future of the beverage world. I like the fact that its got a very strong growth history behind it. Were going to be working to reinvigorate that this year of the pod side with some very specific actions that were taken. And we also had the balance sheet to finance that growth moving forward. I think probably out of anything and this is not a surprise. A company thats grown as fast as Keurig has, has plenty of opportunities for process improvement does anyone would expect and thats going to be a key focus of mine I think as we move through 2016. And I think I can actively help build that. There was a question on forecasting. We can do some more work on that, despite some of the challenges of having a bigger external volume base for our pods. And I think too just some of the discipline in rigor around investments spending I think is something else that I would want to focus on. I think were under levered and we have the flexibility to use our balance sheet to return cash to shareholders and also to invest in future growth for the company and want to see us put some of that to work. And I have a pretty heavy focus on cash flow generation. I mentioned working capital. I think that's a pretty wide area and it takes time. Weve got a complicated supply base here on the appliance side even though its not that big of a portion of our overall sales and with the supply chain as long as weve got but there are things we can do and I will say, even here in the fourth quarter, we've taken a much more active role in trying to make sure were getting delivery of brewers on a just-in-time basis as opposed to building inventories before we need them. So cash flow focus is something else I will be focusing on. Akshay Jagdale Okay. And then I just have a couple more longer term questions. So one of the, I guess, debates around the stock is the profitability and the penetration rates, both of which people would argue have peaked? So I don't want to focus on the penetration rates because I think the holiday season will -- consumers will speak to that. But can you -- you can help us with the profitability side? So Brian said before that the issue with profitability had -- is basically on the brewer side of the business and not on the pods, and thats a major disconnect with what some of the investment community is pricing into the stock right now? You do give a pretty detailed gross profit bridge which tells you that pod mix was a $40 million hit for the year, which is not that significant. So can you just help us, I mean, where is pod profitability, 2013 Investor Day, generally speaking, you said 50% margins, a lot has happened since then with new partners coming in? Where is pod profitability and sort of can that be maintained at reasonable levels going forward? That's my first question? And second one relates to profitability, but its about the partnerships. So Brian you said, partnerships and innovation go hand-in-hand, and obviously, you had a big product launch past year didn't go as well as planned, youve taken write-downs on View and Rivo and now on Bolt. So where does that leave the partnerships from a long-term basis in terms of how strong they are? Thank you. Pete Leemputte Sure. Let me first talk on pod profitability. I think there's a number of levers that any company can have for dealing with it and you heard me mention too, the level of obsolescence charges that we experienced on the pod side went up significantly last year. Also in terms of operating efficiencies on pod manufacture, we grew that last year and we have plans to continue to manage that. I think when you look at pod profitability on a per pod basis, a penny profit as you might call it, that isnt how I think about it, I think of it from a margin percentage basis. And I do think that there's -- weve seen a little bit of erosion there, but it -- and the mix affect was real for the year, so dont get me wrong, but that was to be expected and it was largely expected by the company, because youre bringing in a lot more. We brought in quite a few private label brands, as well as additional partners. And we all know we make more money per pod on our owned and licensed brands. If you listen to what I said, we fully expect that mix effect to be mitigated in the New Year, because were going to start lap some of those comparisons and I think that transition that we've gone through is one of the real key drivers there. But if we keep our -- if we keep our focus on OEE, obsolescence and can maintain a disciplined pricing with partners as well, we should be in pretty good shape. Brian Kelley Akshay, I will address the second question about the relationship between innovation and partnerships, and you're right, weve long believe that they go hand-in-hand. The strength of our system since its outset has been the multi-branded open architecture and in fact the consumers can have a wide variety of choice. And it flows where it takes innovation to drop partners in and to keep partners in and we've been quite successful at that. And then the partnerships and the innovation build upon one another and so we are confident that our system continue to be innovation leader that we maintain strong partnerships, that we can offer the right amount of choice and variety to consumer, and thats we've been able to do. So we look at the fact that the portfolio, we address our brand as a portfolio, we know that we need to build our own brands, we need our partner brands to be strong, we look at this year, the coffee prices this year were, no question a drag on our profitability and that certainly improves as we move through 2016. But the portfolio is what matters. We have a strong portfolio of owned and licensed brands. We have a strong portfolio of partner brands, private label brands, we now have the choice we need in the system to offer to every consumer the right opportunities to try and drink new beverages, we will continue to expand -- appropriately expand the brands we have and the varieties we have. So partnerships and innovation will go hand-in-hand. When you're an innovation company not everything works perfectly and try some and quickly get out of them, and we've done a couple of those, there is no question we could have executed and should have executed 2.0 better. We learned, we move forward and thats what we are doing here. And so its about excavation and operational detail when it comes to appliances, when it comes to productivity, when it comes to everything we are doing. But I will end there, Akshay, partnership and innovation is really how the system was built and it will be the strength of our future as well. Akshay Jagdale Okay. I will pass it on. Brian Kelley Thanks. Operator At this time, we will take a question from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Judy Hong Thank you. Hi, everyone. Brian Kelley Hi, Judy. Judy Hong So, hi, I guess, I have two questions as well, so first on the pods side, Brian, I guess, one of the things that we have continue to see even in the retail data is just the owned brand losing market share to partner brand and unlicensed brand? So can you just talk about some of the effort that you're making to really drive the improvement in your owned brands and how quickly we should see some of that efforts really driving better market share performance? And Pete, when you talked about the mix headwind abating next year sort of outside of kind of the partner brands coming into the system getting lapped, is that also really hinge on the owned brands doing much better than what you are seeing in the marketplace as well? Brian Kelley Yeah. I think, Judy, let me first address the pod share. We are -- we have been throughout this year and it's been to the detriment of our share, we've been rational on pricing. We are going to continue as the leader to be rational in pricing. We remember had coffee costs that were up for us, some others did not have that same position in coffee. And so we are going to be rational pricers and we have the ability to do that. Yeah, we took a share hit this year, because we saw price gaps against brands that are both lower priced and higher priced go the wrong way if we were only concerned about holding volume. We are not. Again, we look at the entire portfolio and so we are going to be rational on pricing and think about the entire portfolio as we move forward. Pete Leemputte And with regard to your second question on pod mix, yeah, certainly, what I was just talking about was the fact that we are going to start to lap, bringing significant volume in from outside the system The other thing too is, Dunkin' and McCafé were relatively new in terms of the retail side of the story, broad retail distribution will start to lap that as well. I think with regard to pricing as Brian mentioned, I will tell you that the guidance that we've pulled together anticipates additional investments for 2016 to try to make sure that we can manage that as effectively as possible. And I dont want to get into more detail than that. Judy Hong Okay. And then if I can just ask the question on KOLD. So Brian, I think you're expecting now about 6200 units sold in KOLD which I think you talked about really being pretty prudent and disciplined in your launch, probably a little bit lower than I think hundreds of thousands of units, that maybe you have called out. So just curious what have you seen so far in terms of the adoption. I guess, some of the reviews that would be leading that would certainly point to the pricing being a key hurdle. So any, sort of, thoughts in terms of how youre thinking about the pricing and the strategy that you are deploying there? Thanks. Brian Kelley Sure, Judy, let me give you a little more color on KOLD. As I mentioned, were in the very early stages of the life of a brand new technology. And it's never possible with something new like this to be exact with forecasting. And we do want to learn and adjust as we go through the year. And as I mentioned, were going to invest at a rate that market success dictates. And so were going to be disciplined and were going to be prudent on this. But let me tell you weve seen in the marketplace so far. On the positive side, what weve seen is consumers lover the taste. It taste fresh both new beverages as well as beverages they are familiar with, they love the taste. They are genuinely surprised that it's cold and is carbonated as it is and the convenience is delivering and that's the most important thing that we're delivering a terrific beverage and we do. Thats the most important piece. But were also learning a lot about what needs to improve and what we can improve. And we know that the first product we put out in the new technology is never going to be perfect. Consumers want it to be smaller. They want it to be less expensive. They want to have more sizes of drinks available. They want a broader selection of drinks. They want all the brands they are used to drinking just like they have in Keurig top. They want a broader variety of beverages. So each of these is being addressed and will get addressed both from a machine standpoint and pod standpoint. But it doesnt happen on the very first machine, were going to learn and were going to improve. But again were going to be very disciplined and pragmatic in our approach to investment levels over the long term and were going to invest only as the marketplace success dictates. Judy Hong Got it. Thank you. Operator The final question today will be from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Brian Kelley Operator? Matthew Grainger Hi Brian. Hi Pete. Operator Your question please. Matthew Grainger Hello. Sorry can you hear me? Brian Kelley Operator, are you there? Did we lose you? Operator Im still here. Matthew Grainger All right. Sorry, this is Matt Grainger. Can you hear me? Brian Kelley I dont know if any one can hear us but it appears that we have a -- we cant hear anybody if you are on the call. So, why dont I do this, why dont I end it by saying thank you for joining our call this evening and thank you for your ongoing support. Thanks.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will take our first question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane Hi. Good afternoon everyone. Brian Kelley Hi Bryan. Pete Leemputte Hi Bryan. Bryan Spillane Just two questions. The first one, just in terms of the FX effect that you are expecting on EPS is much greater than what youre expecting in terms of revenue growth. So could you just talk through just what it is thats affecting your operating income? I guess thats the first question. Pete Leemputte Sure. Bryan, the greatest exposure we have is obviously to the Canadian dollar and the revenue exposure is noticeable. But when you think of the incremental profit that's actually in Canadian dollars, keep in mind that both coffee and the brewers are dollar denominated so that tends to exacerbate the impact that you see in that market and thats the key reason for why its such a big factor. Were going to look at some additional ways of hedging that exposure than what we've done historically and thats going to be a key focus pretty early in the year. Bryan Spillane Okay. Thank you, Pete. And then Brian, just in terms of the sharper on price points on the brewers going into the holiday period, can you just talk to particularly with the MINI and the price point coming down as much as it is, why -- why was it -- was price really a gating factor in terms of getting new adoption or was it more the quality perception of the confusion issue. Im just trying to understand why we need to promote as aggressively to sort of bring consumers into the market. Is it just a matter of you got to grab their attention again and price is the best way to do it or was there something else in terms of your overall cost of the system that was the gating factor for people to adopt? Brian Kelley Bryan, I think there is really two separate issues going on, one the MINI returning in full distribution is a real help. And we've got new insight this year as the MINI went away as to exactly who the MINI brings into the system and it brings new users into the system. And thats the first thing. And while we knew that a bit, we didnt really see its impact until it went away. The My K-Cup is another factor that really helps bring new users in the system because they say, okay, I can continue to hold on to the bad coffee I have but I can also try a MINI at a fairly low price, less than $100. So I think the MINI is one factor. The other thing is that the price points we've reflected in K200 this holiday season and the K40 in this holiday season at certain customers is also really driving the same issue. Its -- we're realizing that the price point, weve said this for a bit now, the sub $100 price point is important to get new users. And then we want to have premium models where consumers can trade up and loyal Keurig users can step into models with better features and larger reservoirs. So we think thats the mix we want. We have the right brewer lineup now for the season. We have the right price points. We have the My K-Cup back. We don't have the 2.0 launch confusion that we faced last year. And we have lower return rates. So with that, were rolling into this holiday season. Bryan Spillane All right. Thanks Brian. Brian Kelley Sure. Thank you. Operator At this time, well take our next question from Steve Powers with UBS. Steve Powers Hey thanks. Thanks a lot. Actually -- so first a question for Pete if I could. So Pete, obviously getting a handle on where Keurig business will trend in the future has been difficult both for those on the inside and the outside of the company in 15. So as you step into your new role, I was wondering if you could just rate the degree of control over which you think you have visibility to forecast in your current role versus maybe what you experienced at Mead Johnson and to the extent the visibility is different, why is that and what you think it will take to close any gaps? What I think were all trying to assess essentially is the degree to which this new outlook is really firmly achievable or if there is more room for surprise and downside disappointment? Brian Kelley Its an excellent question. And I think sitting on the outside you could say, it should be better. I think once Ive been inside here most of the variability that we've seen and forecast isnt with our owned and licensed brands, thats with partners and recognize that in terms of their forecasting and what they're telling us they want us to manufacture for them and that has been where the variability has come in. Now it just so happens that I think too when you look at our mix, this was talked about throughout the last year, partners are an increasing piece of the overall volume that we manufacture, so that tends to I think exacerbate the issue as were doing our forecasting. That being said, I think there is some good opportunities here for better aligning forecast with partners. I know some of the new folks that have come in to run the U.S. business are putting a very, very high emphasis on that. And I think that we can do better but it will take a little bit of time to get there. Steve Powers Okay, okay. Thats fair. And then I guess Brian or Pete, if I could just shift to brewers, could you give us a sense for where you think channel inventories sat exiting 2015, especially on the original 2.0 SKUs the 300, 400, 500 series? And related to that do you still expect shipments will be positive in the first quarter versus last year? And I guess if I could just pile one more. As you rely -- this is kind of a follow-up to the earlier question, as you rely more and more on those low-price brewers to grow the installed base, what does that imply about the future attachment rate, the ability to maintain historical pricing and still grow, essentially is the quality of todays incremental household the same that it was in past? And do have data that people actually trade up from what you're labeling entry-level products to sort of higher end, presumably higher attachment rate better economic type products? Thanks. Pete Leemputte So Steve, Ill answer the first question with regard to the inventories in the channel. We believe that there were hundreds of thousands of excess brewers in the channel when the holiday season ended. And we had higher inventories too. So it was a significant factor, thats at the end of the first quarter. And what we've seen are lower shipments for the remaining three quarters of the year, which has affected our shipments and made some of the comparisons a bit tougher compared to the prior year. We think they are in better shape at this point in time whether theyre absolutely there or not will also be dependent on the holiday season for 2015. So I dont want to get too far ahead of ourselves in that front. And as for first quarter shipments for us, Id say, were very confident that we should see a higher retail sales for brewers compared to the prior year. The number of reasons for optimism there including the fact that all the pod compatibility issues that we were dealing with a year ago are largely behind us we believe, we got that four-star plus rating on the K200 that should help us as well. How that translates into our own shipment level will be dependent on the retailer inventory situation. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves and start to forecast that. But you won't -- I think one thing we can say for certain, you won't see the sort of volume drag that youve seen for the last three quarters for the company in terms of our shipments in the first quarter of 2016. Brian Kelley Let me address your second question about attachment rate. As with lower price brewers, it doesnt make a difference. Weve seen the only thing that drives attachment rate difference is the presence of a reservoir or non-reservoir brewer. So it's not necessarily a price point but what happens is a MINI and non-reservoir brewer tends to have a lower attachment rate than a reservoir brewer. So when we take and offer the K40 or the K200 at an attractive price, we don't see any change in attachment rate at all. The MINI now that its back will be more at normal levels for us. So we don't see lower price points in effect driving attachment rate lower. And we've not really seen that our attachment rate has been very steady because the second piece of the question was about really is the quality in installed base that comes in with a lower-brewer lower. Im going to answer that two ways, both are encouraging for us. First, we don't see that a lower price point consumer brew is less in fact in terms of pod consumption we see about the same. The other thing we would say as well, while the mix of the brand may differ. We don't see a difference in actual consumption of pods. So we've not seen a decrease or a change at all in the quality of the installed base. I think we are learning more and more how to target households that are heavy coffee households but we have a lot more to do to get that right and to be more precise with that. Weve much, much more to do on the marketing side and on the commercial side to make that right. So the attachment rate is if its fluctuated at the same level its fluctuated for the last number of years. And so we have not seen that yet but we would expect as we grow. Were going to have to grow the installed base. Were going to have to be more and more sharply focused on ensuring that the quality of the installed base we bring in is equally strong or even stronger. Steve Powers Great. Thanks. Good luck. Brian Kelley Thanks, Steve. Operator And moving forward, we will hear from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First for Pete, can you elaborate a little bit on your first impressions and priorities are, as you comment what youve learned, especially in light of what youve heard from investors, maybe you can comment on some of the misconceptions out there.

And we know that the first product we put out in the new technology is never going to be perfect. Consumers want it to be smaller. They want it to be less expensive. They want to have more sizes of drinks available. They want a broader selection of drinks. They want all the brands they are used to drinking just like they have in Keurig top. They want a broader variety of beverages. So each of these is being addressed and will get addressed both from a machine standpoint and pod standpoint. But it doesnt happen on the very first machine, were going to learn and were going to improve. But again were going to be very disciplined and pragmatic in our approach to investment levels over the long term and were going to invest only as the marketplace success dictates. Judy Hong Got it. Thank you. Operator The final question today will be from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Brian Kelley Operator? Matthew Grainger Hi Brian. Hi Pete.

Jack Scannell - UBS Investment Bank Jo Walton - Credit Suisse AG Operator Welcome to the Sanofi Q1 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call and Live Webcast. My name is Emma, the Chorus Call operator. [Operator Instructions]. The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast. At this time, it is my pleasure to hand over to Mr. George Grofik, Vice President, Head of Investor Relations at Sanofi. Please go ahead, sir. George Grofik Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Thank you for joining us to review Sanofi's first quarter results. As usual, you can find the slides on this call on the Investors page of our website at sanofi.com. Moving to Slide 2. I would like to remind you that information presented in this call contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially. I refer you to our Form 20-F document on file with the SEC and also our Document de Référence for a description of these risk factors. With that, please advance to Slide 3 and let me introduce our speakers on the call today. With me are Olivier Brandicourt, Chief Executive Officer; Jerome Contamine, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as well as David, Executive Vice President, Sanofi Genzyme.  Also joining us today for the Q&A session are, Olivier Charmeil, Executive Vice President, General Medicines & Emerging Markets; Peter Guenter, Executive Vice President, Diabetes & Cardiovascular; Karen Linehan, Executive Vice President, Legal Affairs and General Counsel; David Loew, Executive Vice President, Sanofi Pasteur; Alan Main, Executive Vice President, Consumer Healthcare; and Elias Zerhouni, President, Global R&D. First, Olivier will discuss the key highlights of the first quarter, then David will provide an update on our immunology franchise. After that, Jérôme will review Sanofi's financial results before we open the call to Q&A. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that as of the start of 2017, Sanofi's financial statements include the impact of the acquisition of the Boehringer Ingelheim's Consumer Healthcare business, the divestment of our Animal Health business and the termination of the Sanofi Pasteur's European Vaccines JV.  In order to help you compare sales growth rate on a like-for-like basis, we will be referring to growth at both cost exchange rate and at constant structure. This has been noted in the slides at CER/CF.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier. Olivier Brandicourt Thank you, George. Good morning, good afternoon to everyone and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. So before I turn to the results in greater detail, I'd like to highlight the impact of the changes in structure that took effect this quarter as they had a distorting effect on sales growth. With this in mind, Slide 5 provides a bridge to demonstrate the like-for-like sales growth of the company.  If we add back the 384 million of sales that would have been generated in Q1 2016, if we had owned the BI brands and European Vaccines, then our first quarter sales growth at CER and constant structure was 3.5%.  On the same basis, our growth rates in the previous two quarters was approximately 3%. This consistent growth trend speaks to the strength of our diversified business model.  On Slide 6, I'm pleased to report that Sanofi has delivered an encouraging start to the year, with a benefit of structural changes, our first quarter sales grew by 8.6% in CR to reach 8.6 billion. Our business EPS increased by 3% to 1.42.  As I mentioned, sales growth was 3.5%, if we also adjust for constant structure. Our business EPS performance was particularly encouraging as we faced significant headwinds in the quarter from the loss of Animal Health contribution and from a higher tax rate.  We managed to more than offset these negative factors as a result of solid underlying sales momentum and the benefits from simplification of the organization which as you know, is a key element of our 2020 Strategic Roadmap.  Here, you can see that on Slide 7, that 4 of our 5 global business units delivered growth in the first quarter which more than compensated for a decline in our Diabetes and Cardiovascular units.  The highlight, as in prior quarters, with Sanofi Genzyme which again grew in double digits. Our Vaccines business grew strongly growing at 13.2% at CER and constant structure. In addition, we saw a further improvement in the momentum of our Consumer Healthcare business following the acquisition of the BI brands with core growth of 4.7% at CER and constant structure.  Turning to Slide 8. We're now looking at sales by franchise and geography in the first quarter. The overall picture is reassuring. It is very pleasing to see that all 6 franchises grew in the Emerging Markets, with 3 growing in double digits.  You can also see here that the main offsets to our first quarter performance were the pressures on our Diabetes and established products franchises in developed markets.  Now turning to our Specialty Care franchise on Slide 9. We again delivered strong growth in Multiple Sclerosis, where our Rare Disease franchise was impacted by the usual differences in order facing quarter-over quarter. Ostensibly, we received a welcome boost from our Oncology business as a result of the U.S. government order.  In MS, we gained share in the first quarter with sales up 32%. The main driver was again, our overall therapy, Aubagio which grew by 30%. Our high efficacy product, Lemtrada, also made significant progress, with sales up 41%. Taken together, our MS franchise is now annualizing at 2 billion in sales.  In Rare Diseases, we maintained our double-digit momentum in the treatment of Fabry and Pompe disease, mainly as a result of new patient accruals. Our Gaucher franchise on the other hand was impacted by the timing of Cerezyme orders in Latin America.  As a result, overall sales growth in Rare Diseases slipped from double-digit in prior quarters to 7.6% in the first quarter. Of course, we're very excited about creating a new immunology franchise within Sanofi Genzyme with the recent approval of Dupixent, an FDA acceptance of our BLA for Kevzara. This opens a new chapter in our growth story in Specialty Care and I'm delighted to have David on the call to discuss our new franchise in a few minutes.  Looking at Vaccines on Slide 10. We were very pleased to show growth in first quarter sales of 13.2% at CER and constant structure. The key driver in the quarter was our combination Vaccines franchise were sales grew 38% at CER at constant structure.  Significant elements in this performance was the prior recovery of Pentacel in the U.S. In addition, we have seen a recovery of our Chinese Vaccines business after the last year's market disruptions.  Our AcXim family of pediatric combination products grew 19% and was helped by the recovery in China. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we're optimistic about the long term growth prospect of our AcXim family built around accessing our 6-in-1 pediatric vaccine.  Finally, on this slide, we were delighted to add to our Vaccines a pipeline in the quarter by an agreement with immune to develop and commercialize SB0232, the promising monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSP related in babies and infants.  Turning to Slide 11. Highlighted earlier is the continued pickup in momentum of our Consumer Healthcare business which now ranks as the leading global player in CHC. At CER and constant structure, our expanded CHC business would have grown by 4.7% in the first quarter, in line with our longer term target of sustained mid-single-digit growth.  Much of this momentum was delivered by an early and strong cough and cold season in Europe but also enhanced by the launch of OTC Xyzal in the U.S. which brought in over 40 million of sales.  The growth of our CHC business in Emerging Markets continued to show sequential improvement but it is still not where we want it to be, mainly due to the tough economic environment in Russia. Let me conclude on this slide by confirming that the integration of BI is progressing well.  Turning to Slide 12. Sales of our growing Diabetes franchise declined by 6% in the first quarter. This was primarily driven by a 15% decline in the U.S. business which more than offset double-digit growth in Emerging Markets.  We caution against extrapolating first quarter performance to the remaining quarters of 2017 as we expect the U.S. Diabetes sales decline to accelerate over the remainder of the year. Keep in mind that there will be an incremental effect from the CBS formulary exclusion in Q2 and the United Health formulary just went into effect on April 1.  Consequently, it remains our expectation, as we said last quarter, that Diabetes performance in 2017 is highly likely to come in below our minus 4 to minus 8 midyear guidance range.  Within the overall outlook for the franchise, we expect to make steady progress with the rollout of our basal insulin, GLP-1 combo product, Soliqua and you have secured efficient coverage in the U.S. in the first quarter.  Turning to Cardiovascular. Praluent continues to be impacted by a challenging payer environment, however, we were pleased that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit states that Praluent injunction, Praluent injunction litigation with Amgen pending the appeal. Consequently, our product continues to be available to patients.  During the quarter, we have seen the competitive outcomes data continue to support the evidence base behind the PCSK9 class and we look forward to reporting our own outcomes data with Praluent in Q1 next year.  On Slide 13, our emerging market performance was a highlight of the quarter, up 8.5% at CER at constant structure. We were pleased that the recovery we had expected in China came through, with first quarter sales increasing by 17%. This reflects both the solid underlying growth in our Pharmaceuticals business and the end of local market disruption in Vaccines.  Slide 14 highlights that this will be a very busy year for our R&D organization, with multiple new investments planned on ongoing in proof of concept and Phase III studies. These investments, of course, includes a broad range of indication expansion studies for Dupixent, consistent with our views that this exciting molecule represents a pipeline in product. I think many of you are already well aware of this and so I wanted to take the opportunity here to highlight some of the other innovative programs that perhaps had been less of a focus.  The key strategic imperative is to step-up our investments in Oncology and here we have a range of studies planned or underway for rituximab in multiple myeloma and for the PD-1 inhibitor in [indiscernible] dermotypes. We also plan on initiating a study of rituximab in combination with the PD-1. Coming up fast behind this we're also making progress with our toxin loader antibody conjugates.  I will also like to highlight our biospecific monoclonal antibody for IPS, a deadly disease with very few options, as you know and our dual agonist for type 2 diabetes. Both are innovative although higher risk and potentially address multiple indications.  I should also note that we plan to start late-stage development of our GLP-52401 to have trial around the end of this year and overall GCS inhibitor could represent pipeline of new products.  As you know, sustaining innovation in R&D is 1 of the 4 key pillars of our 2020 Strategic Roadmap and I am confident that we're making good progress here.  Having highlighted earlier on these slides, I will now hand over to David Meeker, our head of Sanofi Genzyme, but before I do, that I would like to say I would like to say a few words about David. Many of you will be aware that David has been essential to the success of Sanofi Genzyme since we bought the business in 2011. In that time, he has driven continued growth in Rare Diseases, he has built a 2 billion Multiple Sclerosis franchise and, last but not least, he has always seen inception and now reality of our new immunology franchise. David deserves all our thanks. Over to you, David. David Meeker Thank you, Olivier. And it's been a privilege to lead this business over the past 6 years and leave it in the very capable hands of my colleague, Bill Sibold. So I know there's a tremendous amount of interest in the immunology franchise which is launching and so if we turn to Slide 16. I'll remind you again that as Olivier has said, this is truly a pipeline and a product and we're approved for atopic dermatitis. I'll update you on the launch in the next slide.  The asthma Phase III trial is fully enrolled and again, we hope to be filing by the end of the year on that indication. The nasal polyposis indication at Phase III trial is enrolling and we look to have data from using eosinophilic esophagitis trial again coming out this year.  I think the biggest challenges we have in helping physicians think about this is to get the dermatologist to think about it co-morbidities to get the pulmonologist ultimately when the asthma medications approved to be thinking about atopic dermatitis and nasal polyposis. And so again, it's a paradigm shift for medicine.  So if you turn to Slide 17. I'll provide you some background as to where we're on the launch with the major caveat that it's extremely early. I'm going to provide some numbers that we won't be updating on a regular basis going forward. But obviously, absent significant insight into our revenue stream at this point, I think these numbers are important for you to understand how the launch is going.  Overall, very positive about the how the launch is going. From an operational standpoint, we shipped within the first 24 hours, the sales force reimbursement teams, medical affairs that are in the field, all that is working well. And operationally, we haven't seen any major challenges here as we launch.  So the target, as we've highlighted many times, is 300,000 patients with adult AD, who feel are in the highest need. We're focusing on the 7,000 physicians have experienced using and prescribing biologics. That may not be an exact universe and some of the early scripts have been written by physicians who are not on our target least. So, not a surprise but does support the broader awareness around this product and certainly, the large unmet medical need.  So as of this point, actually through last week, more than 1,200 HCPs have written a prescription for the drug. That translates into more than 2,500 descriptions that have been written to date. On the market access side of the equation, and myself have spent a lot of time working with the different payers in the U.S. We do have coverage from the major 2 PBMs, Express Scripts and CVS which accounts for about 25% of the covered lives in the U.S., that's the national formularies. And we're continuing to work with again, all of the other payer groups. Some would expect that by the end of the year that we would have broad coverage for the product. The goal of this conversation we know as you follow probably in the press, we're to price the product that we recognizes the value but continues to ensure good access. From a utilization management criteria standpoint, we've worked hard to make sure that the criteria reflect good medical practice. So specifically, this is a drug that should be prescribed by a physician who's an expert, so an allergist, immunologist or dermatologist. And we would expect the patients have maxed out on their topical steroids. If you could be managed with a topical steroids, this would not be the right drug for you. But obviously, there's a significant number of patients for whom that's not possible. So there's some variation payer to payer in terms of the kind of UN that they would like. And those are the discussions that are ongoing but the principle behind it is again, to get the medical criteria in place. We're going to back part of the CHMP at the European experience will be supported by the CAFÉ study which is a study which looked at patients who had failed or were intolerant to cyclosporine trend is not indicate for the treatment of ADE. But it's occasionally use then, of course, have some significant toxicities associated with it as well. So overall, extremely positive about where we're in the U.S. but again, early.  Moving to Slide 18. Kevzara, we've just announced that we have our PDUFA date for May 22. We have a positive CHMP opinion in Europe. So we will be launching and it's a good moment to launch into RA. I think the trends, as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, the use of non-TNF mechanism action products is increasing. Clearly, the cycling that previously had taken place in TNF is declining for good medical reasons, if you've got other mechanisms of action which can try benefit. Monotherapy, I think more and more patients are on monotherapy in the recognition of the many of patients will started on a combo of and a TNF, for example. Methotrexate is not the easiest drug to take. And often patients will stop that and so either purposefully or inadvertently, they end up on monotherapy. And finally, patients given the option who preferred sub-Q as opposed to an IV. So in that context, we think the IL-6 class and Kevzara specifically has a key role to play. IL-6, as we've said often, I think experts would concur if in the first drug approved, it might have moved ahead of the TNS. It wasn't. So it's second to market but it clearly has a central role in the pathogenesis, pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis. We have strong Phase III results in the methotrexate inadequate responder group in TNF inadequate responders. We've got a positive trial and head-to-head trial with Humira where we hit on all of our endpoints and we've got very consistent results at every 2 week dosing. So this potential of having to increase the frequency which you've seen with other products doesn't seem to be the case for Kevzara. So again, very positive about what's happening there. And looking forward to that launch. So with that, I'll hand it over to Jérôme. Jerome Contamine Thank you, David, for this presentation. I will go quick, where we're on the financials. And now on Slide 20. So before discussing the details of the P&L, I would like to again to highlight that the [indiscernible] changed compared positively this quarter to our reported first quarter figures, clearly, in contrast with 2016. This was expected.  In total, currency movements added 2.5% or 194 million to reported sales on 3% of $0.04 per share to reported business EPS. So latter has contributed to this positive effect, as expected, again, with the U.S. dollar.  Now I'll move to Slide 21, looking at the P&L of the reported basis. Sales were just over 8.6 billion, representing 8.6% growth at constant rate. Again, this includes the impact of acquisition for CHC as well as the contribution of our vaccine European business.  You can see on the slide a few items which complicate the picture, as already mentioned, that because the tax rate of the quarter was higher than the low tax rate we had for the first quarter of 2016 which was 22.6%.  I just confirmed here that for 2017, we continue to expect the tax rate in the 24% to 25% range.  Second, we have no net income contribution for our divested Animal Health business this quarter as compared with the contribution of 171 million last year for the same quarter. Taken together, it reduced our growth at the business net income level to 1% in the quarter to 1.8 billion. Against this, we're fully offset the headwind of Animal Health divestment and share repurchases, the consequence of business EPS grew by 3% to 1.42.  I now move to Slide 22 to give a clear picture of the ongoing business. We're just here providing that P&L at constant exchange rates but also at constant structure. So we're comparing our actual versus what we would have looked like if we had instituted both BI CHC, as well as the Sanofi Pasteur business. We again saw gross profit increase faster than sales, up 5.4% at constant exchange rates to 6.2 billion, affecting cost savings on improved product mix.  Another message on this slide is that we again delivered operating leverage with our BOI, up 7.6% on sales up 3.5%. This represents a 120 basis points improvement from BOI margin was combination of improved gross margin on carefully controlled expenses.  I now move to Slide 23 which here combines our cost ratios in a little more detail. Our gross margin increased by 130 basis points, building on the positive trend we saw in 2016. This again affects the combination of the improved product mix and productivity gains. For the full year, we continue to expect the cost margin to be approximately 70% at constant exchange rates.  This is below the reported in Q1, reflecting part of increasing Diabetes cost pressures in the U.S. which should be largely offset by mix of some positive the benefits, as well as the larger contribution of Vaccines in the second half of the year.  Turning to OpEx. If we adjust the constant structure, as well as constant exchange rate, they grow in the first quarter by 1.7%. R&D expenses were up 2.1%, representing investment in new Phase III programs while SG&A expenses were up 1.5%, driven by prelaunch cost for our immunology contracts.  For the full year of 2017, we expect R&D spending to be -- to somewhat accelerate as a result of the multiple pipeline investment that Olivier highlighted.  For SG&A, we continue to expect expenses to grow, mainly driven by investments behind the launch of Dupixent and Kevzara which I think both surged clearly, hearing David. We expect progressive savings on SG&A for sure in other areas, resulting from prioritization and implementation of our new organization which will partially offset the investments.  Savings in SG&A together with manufacturing deficiencies on higher growth privatization of the Established Products will be an important contributor to the roughly 1.3 billion of cost savings that we planned for this year which is in line with our previous guidance.  Overall, we maintain our expectation that OpEx in 2017 will grow at CER at a similar rate as last year of the cost of social base of approximately 15.4 billion in 2016.  Turning to Slide 24. I'd like to highlight the elements of our cash flow. Our free cash flow reflects an improvement of the recent ratio, some inventory build related to launches and some increased investment building capacity.  As previously announced, we continue to execute our 3.5 billion share buyback program. We bought around 17 million shares during the first quarter for a total of 1.3 billion. This brings our total repurchase activities in the Q3 2016 to 2.8 billion at the end of Q1 2017.  Also, on this slide, you will see that our net debt benefited from the proceeds of the swap with BI. Please note that a tax payment related with the transaction is most likely to occur during the coming quarters, Q2, Q3 and to a small extent, Q4, for a total amount of approximately 2 billion.  Finally, the payment of our dividends should be approximately 2.7 billion which due to be paid on May 18.  On Slide 25 now, we're pleased to the start of the year, clearly which reflects our good overall business performance, as well as increased focus of our new organization. The outlook for the year is expected to benefit from the ramp-up of our cost savings associated with our efforts to focus our company as the synergies from the BI swap. However, as we highlighted, we expect some headwinds in our U.S. Diabetes franchise to grow in subsequent quarters and we plan significant investments in our franchise on our growing pipeline. As a result, we're confirming our full year guidance for business EPS to be stable to down 3% at constant exchange rate. In terms of currency, we see positive impact on business EPS to be between 3% and 4%, based on March 2017 average exchange rates.  With that said, I would like to turn the call back to Olivier for closing remarks. Olivier Brandicourt Thank you, Jérôme. So just to summarize our position. We think we continued to execute on our 2020 Strategic Roadmap. Our first quarter results benefited from our diversified business model and from the simplification of our organization. We now have a global leadership position in CHC and the integration of the business is proceeding well.  We're managing our way through a tough U.S. payer environment in Diabetes. At the same time, we're fully focused on delivering successful launches from our exciting new Immunology assets and progressing the next wave of pipeline innovation.  And with that, I would like to hand over to George to start the Q&A. George Grofik We will now open the call to your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mr. Florent Cespedes from Societe Generale. Florent Cespedes So two questions. First, for Peter. Could you tell us if you have retained some prescriptions from CVS in the U.S. or if there is a message which to the biosimilar or the novel products in the U.S.? And if not, what is your strategy to potentially come back on some formularies? And maybe a follow-up question on your strategy regarding stimulus [indiscernible] and my second question would be for Olivier. Just to confirm if there is anything new regarding your strategy or M&A strategy and if you're still looking for opportunities? Olivier Brandicourt Thank you, Flor. You want to start, Peter? Yes? Peter Guenter Yes, sure. So first on your question on the retention on CVS. So you remember, we put into place a $10 co-pay strategy for both and Toujeo and we're relatively satisfied with this co-pay program because we have been able to retain in total CVS 55% of our volumes. Now remember, CVS is actually composed of 2 sub-pockets, if you will, the national template and then you have the custom plans, both account for roughly 20 million commercial lives. And out of the custom plans, actually, so out of that 20 million custom plans, we have been able to retain 70% axis as such for Lantus and Toujeo. So in total, 55% retention of TRxs and if you would then drill it down to the national formulary of CVS commercial, where we totally lost access, so we only have the couponing strategy as a mitigation strategy, there we were able to retain 43% of the TRxs. So if you compare this with benchmarks, I think it's fair to say that our couponing program has been relatively successful. Your follow-up question on lease, as I mentioned, already last quarter, so we have been submitted the file in Europe and the MA has accepted the file for evaluation and for concerns in the U.S. for competitive reasons, we cannot give any additional background on that. Olivier Brandicourt Thank you. Thank you, Peter. So to your question regarding M&A. Yes, I can confirm that nothing has really changed. We're continuing to focus on creating value for shareholders. Our main driver -- main drivers are the strategic fit as we presented in November 2015, right? So looking at strengthening our business in IRTAs where we have already some level of leadership or others where we're looking at building competitive positions and that is MS, oncology, immunology and CHC. When it comes to value creation to shareholder, we said it also last time, we want to remain financially disciplined and we're solidly looking at deals where we strongly believe we can achieve a return on invested capital exceeding ROI. And finally, driver is of course the pipeline because Sanofi pipeline has been significantly strengthened over the last few years, but we believe our R&D capabilities could be further enhanced. Operator The next question comes from the line of Mr. Graham Parry of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Graham Parry So firstly, on Diabetes, could you quantify the incremental volume loss that we should expect in the second quarter from the UnitedHealth contract, taking in any incremental impacts from CVS that you were referring to? And any initial 2018 contracting commentary you can give us, how that's going, how you're prioritizing pricing versus access, especially given the need to get Soliqua access, too? And then secondly, on the Praluent, if you could just give us a feel for what's driving the delay on ODYSSEY, is that just an event rate update happening slower? Do you think you can still get this data in time for ACC and in time for 2019 contracting negotiations? Olivier Brandicourt Thank you, Graham. So the first question, for you, Peter and the OTC question for Elias. Peter Guenter Yes, Graham, so thanks for the question. And the number of lives in United commercial is actually 60 million. So this is less than, for example, the CVS commercial lives, 40 million. You should also know that Toujeo was not covered at United, contrary to Lantus. And of course, we were in a Tier 3 position, so we suspect the impact of United to be less important than the impact of CVS. So your question on 2018 contracting, of course, it is very early to comment on that. As you know, we have, of course, submitted our bids. And we'll have to wait until we get the results of those bids. And in terms of prioritization, we, of course, have a strategy of keeping a large coverage for many reasons, not only for Lantus and Toujeo, but also in the future for Soliqua. I think the Praluent question is for... Elias Zerhouni Yes, Graham, for OTC, nothing has really changed. As you know, it's an event-driven trial. And we do want to absolutely perform this trial in the best possible way because I think it's critical for the field that we accumulate the best scientific experience and data to enlighten us in terms of the value of PCSK9. So we were hoping, as you remember, to complete all of the events by models that we had by the end of the year. It's clear that we will be able to recruit all the events by the end of the year. But then you have a certain amount of time to analyze that data. On your question about ACC, we're making every effort to be able to present at the ACC. But because it's really beyond our control where the events are and their adjudication, I can't promise. But that's my hope. Graham Parry Okay, so no change at all in the number of events or follow-up [indiscernible] the study there? Elias Zerhouni Absolutely not, no. Operator The next question comes from the line of Vincent Meunier of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Meunier Three questions, please. The first question is on Diabetes. So you've clearly highlighted the deeper decline expected this year in Diabetes and particularly for the remainder of 2017. Has anything changed recently which would make you more cautious? Or is your message today just to reiterate what you said before? Because my feeling is that your tone today is a bit more cautious than before. The second question is on Multiple Sclerosis. Can you comment on the pricing trend for Aubagio and also the price environment in MS in general going forward? And the last question is a follow-up on strategy. The follow-up question on M&A, I mean, you said earlier that you might continue buyback and renew buyback if you're not in a position to find a suitable target. Is it still a valid comment? Olivier Brandicourt All right. Thank you, Vincent. On Diabetes, I don't think there is anything new that we're trying to convey today. We just wanted to highlight the Q1 results, the equation of that good result is it was a minus 6% result and it's minus 15% in the U.S., offset by a plus 12% or 13% in China. So we have that momentum in China. Are we going to see that for the rest of the year? We're not entirely sure. And then in the U.S., the indication is what we're trying to convey. We have these formulary decisions which we learned in last August regarding UnitedHealthcare which has not had any impact during Q1. And we see that during the rest of the year, in addition again of CVS which was only partially, had only a partial impact in Q1. And I think maybe, Peter, you can also provide more color around how much more prescription do we have in the government channel, like Medicaid and if you want to add color around whether or not that has changed versus what we conveyed in the past. Peter Guenter No, I think overall we can say that we're actually in line with our expectations. I think you mentioned the 2 key points, Olivier, of the reasons of the deceleration in the U.S. that we forecast in the year-to-go which is, of course, a full impact of CVS. The first quarter was only a partial impact, right? It started to slide actually as of the last 1 or 2 weeks of December. And then we have the additional impact of UnitedHealthcare. It is true that the channel mix remains unfavorable but not more unfavorable than we have anticipated. But of course, as the year unwinds, you get more sales in unprofitable channels. So it's normal in your net sales that you get an acceleration of the decrease. And perhaps the last piece we can provide is that we stick with our long term guidance of minus 4% to minus 8% and CAGR, 15% to 18%. But we also remind you, like we reminded to you in the last quarter, is that for the year 2017, we will be probably below the lower end of that long-range guidance. Olivier Brandicourt Okay, thank you, Peter. David, do you want to answer the Aubagio question? David Meeker Yes. So with regard to pricing, I mean, we all know there's much more focus on pricing in the U.S. overall, so it's obviously a point of debate. I think with regard to the MS class specifically, it is part of that discussion. Fundamentally, nothing has changed as of now. The things I'd remind you of is Aubagio itself is the lowest-priced oral with further discounting off the WACC, of course. And from a dataset standpoint, it's the only oral that had a hit on confirmed disability reduction in both Phase III trials, prevention of progression there. So it has a strong dataset. ICER evaluated the class and concluded that the platform therapies and the orals did not meet cost-effective criteria. But I think this was a good example where we're still in dialogue with them. I think we'd have some concerns about the numbers that they actually used to do that calculation and perhaps not recognizing the full value of Aubagio. And Aubagio, just again to remind you, it's 9% market share in the U.S., fastest-growing oral and 11% in new scripts. So I think the Aubagio picture still remains extremely strong. And conversely, on the pricing standpoint in the ICER evaluation, Lemtrada was the one product in the MS class which was judged cost-effective and by a very large margin. So that's it. Olivier Brandicourt All right. Thank you, David. And Vincent, for your last question, so you heard Jérôme. So we have bought back share at the value of 2.8 billion, 2.9 billion since we announced the share buyback program. That included what we did in Q4 last year to the tune of 1.5 billion and a further 1.3 billion, 1.4 billion as of mid-April. It's actually 1.4 billion. Now to your specific question, I think we can keep in mind that we can always look at opportunistic purchases once we have reached 3.5 billion figure. However, when it comes to the priority of allocation, M&A remains above the share buyback allocation. And you expressed a potential case where we would find anything. But again, we're, as you would expect, looking into different TAs I was mentioning before. And that can eventually happen. So that's what I would answer. That's what I would respond. Operator The next question comes from the line of Mr. Richard Vosser of JPMorgan. Richard Vosser Just a follow-up on Soliqua, please, just you mentioned the formulary access last quarter and kicking in from July. So just perhaps if you could give us an update on how that access discussion is going at the moment, please? And then secondly, just on the Dupixent data mentioned in the press release from the CAFÉ trial, could you just clarify the meaning of the acceptable safety profile? Have you seen a different safety profile in this trial compared to the previous Phase III trials which has obviously been very good. Just some clarity there would be very useful. Olivier Brandicourt Okay. Thank you, Richard. Soliqua access, yes, Peter? Peter Guenter So Soliqua access, what we've seen is that some payers tried to look at the 2 products, so Soliqua and Xultophy, together. So they are kind of delaying their decision in terms of access. This being said, with what we know today, we know that we have 34% commercial access and 31% R&D access already signed but not necessarily all in place. Some of that is yet to come into effect. And actually, during the first quarter, there was actually no access with the exception of the last 2 weeks of the first quarter. So what you see actually in net sales, of course, was Soliqua is underestimated because of the couponing part, the $0 co-pay which of course, offsets against net sales. Perhaps one additional word on Soliqua, it's obviously very early days. We're only a couple of weeks out of the gate. But it's clear that in terms of patient identification, you know that the product has in its label the intensification space, right, so either patients not [indiscernible] with basal insulin alone, so patients where you would either up-titrate with your basal insulin or intensify them, for example, by adding a GLP-1 or a prandial insulin. So that is actually the sweet spot for Soliqua. But that requires a bit of education of our physicians. So that's really what we're focusing on as we speak.  And we see that after a certain number of visits, they got that message. So what I'm trying to say is that, of course, the access which is gradual and the education of our customer bases will require some time. And therefore, you will see a gradual uptake of Soliqua. Elias Zerhouni So for the CAFÉ safety profile, we did not observe any significant difference in the safety profile in CAFÉ as the others. So nothing to report there. Olivier Brandicourt Nothing to report, okay. Operator The next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Holford of Jefferies. Jeffrey Holford Wonder if you'd like to just comment around the strategy for consumer regarding M&A, whether you have appetite to do business development there immediately or whether you'll need to sort of see through 2017 before you're ready to integrate more transactions. And then actually just would like to step back a moment, just talk more broadly about your Oncology strategy, whether there are specific areas you feel you want to intensify in terms of product additions and development and whether there are specific areas, like hematology or solid tumors in particular, you feel is more attractive for you to focus on. Olivier Brandicourt All right. So on the CHC strategies, definitely we're busy integrating this relatively large business portfolio from BI. We're going that well and Alan is managing his team very effectively. And you can see already that through the results we're posting for this quarter that it's working well. Does that mean that in the midterm or longer term, we wouldn't look at eventually strengthening even further this business? Of course not. So we would be open. As I said, CHC is part of the TAs and areas we wanted to strengthen. We have done definitely a very important step there. But it might not be the end of the story and opportunities will be critical or will determine the future of that aspect. So that's for CHC. Do you want to answer the question on Oncology, Elias? Elias Zerhouni Sure. Yes, let me first state that the Oncology strategy is a multi-tier strategy, multiphase. First and foremost, we're going to continue to develop the franchise around CD38. And when you asked the question, as you know, CD38 is for myeloma. But science shows that it has other potential indications, such as in other hematological malignancies and we're going to explore that as well as combined with PD-1 in which we're already starting some early work, it is actually possible to see indications in tumors, in solid tumors. And the reason is that science is showing that CD38 seems to be in itself a checkpoint inhibitor. And this is what the -- is driving, if you will, the growth of this very important pillar. In addition, we will continue our own internal programs in antibody drug conjugates. We're in talk stage for those.  Second, we're going to build the immuno-oncology franchise on 2 axes. One, obviously, is the collaboration with Regeneron which gives us the checkpoint inhibitors we need, PD-1 and LAG3. And then combined with our own internal assets which are immune activators, if you will, our TGF-beta antibody, our neukine and other approaches that we're putting together which will complement, if you will, the effort with Regeneron. Third, we believe that there is an opportunity in Oncology to perhaps acquire some assets that will be complementary to our portfolio. So we're looking at opportunities that will be complementary strategically to our prostate portfolio, for example and our breast cancer portfolio. We have both internal and external programs that we're looking at for that purpose. So that's the approach. We're building on what we have. We're continuing to build on a complementary strategy to that of the Regeneron, Sanofi collaboration. We will build the part of it that is immune activating. And on top of that, we'll build the multi-targeting strategies that seem to become the dominant approach in cancer control. Olivier Brandicourt Do you want to add a word on the ADC platform we have? Elias Zerhouni Right. So the antibody drug conjugate platform is in the clinic right now. We have 3 of them. And we have early promising clinical data that will be expanded further. And clearly, those are assets that we will continue to explore. Operator Next question comes from the line of Luisa Hector of Exane BNP Paribas. Luisa Hector On Dupixent, can you confirm whether the CAFÉ results are actually required to get the European approval by the end of the year? And then on Diabetes, the glargine franchise, I'm just wondering that now we're sort of seeing more developments in the competitive landscape with BASAGLAR, Soliqua, Xultophy, whether there's any change to your target market share that the Toujeo switch can achieve and whether perhaps Soliqua -- you have a bit more confidence in Soliqua perhaps taking more share than you expected now that we have more information on all the dynamics there. Olivier Brandicourt All right. Thank you, Luisa. Elias, maybe you should answer the regulatory question around CAFÉ. Elias Zerhouni Yes, CAFÉ was, in fact, a requirement of the EMA. In Europe, they do want you to conduct trials against established standard of care, in this case, even nonestablished standard of care [indiscernible] cyclosporine. So it was a requirement of EMA, yes. Peter Guenter Luisa, your question on Toujeo and, let's say, insulins in general with the increased competition in the field of Diabetes. We stick to our initial thinking. So we think that Toujeo is sufficiently differentiated to make the mark. We're happy with the initial launch of this product. It continues to perform extremely well in Europe. We take very significant market shares. We're coming back to very good performances in Japan. We have been making our first launches in Emerging Markets, where the expectation of the product is also a very good. And the interesting thing is that despite all the new competition in the field of Diabetes in general is that the overall insulin market in volumes, even in the U.S., continues to grow 3%, 4%, 5% depending on the quarter. So that's number one. Number two, in countries where we have more maturity with Toujeo, you take, for example, Germany which was the first launch country in Europe, you see, of course, in the beginning that the first source of business for Toujeo is switches from basal insulin and, of course, to the large extent, Lantus. But you see also that moving forward, that Toujeo captures more and more new patients.  For example, today in Germany, the source of business is already 2/3 new patients, right which of course, is an interesting, let's say, opportunity for us to take if you take -- if you look at the overall glargine franchise of Sanofi. So number two on Soliqua, again I provided some early insights, too, in the previous question. Again, it's early days. Don't forget that in the U.S., so FDA did not give us the first injectable label, so post-OAD label, whereas in Europe, we have both the post-OAD label and the insulin intensification label. So that is a fundamental difference of appreciation between EMA and FDA because, of course, the file obviously was the same. So that is basically what I can tell you. Operator Next question comes from the line of Philippe Lanone of Natixis. Philippe Lanone Two remaining ones. First, on CHC, we have a strong growth. However, 40% of that is Xyzal launch. And if we strip out also the strong flu season, probably the underlying growth still is a bit weak. Or is it? And how do you -- can we see that going forward? And can you comment on how the BI business is doing and whether you still maintain the target of bringing the margins of BI to the former Sanofi has won in this business? And another question on Lemtrada which is doing pretty well and accelerating this quarter, while some of the competitors have signaled some weakness in Multiple Sclerosis market on the wake of OCREVU.S. launch by Roche, it should be, I mean, the main target commercially for OCREVU.S.. How do you see this product going forward with this competition? Olivier Brandicourt All right. Thank you for your good questions. So CHC, Alan? Alan Main Obviously, you highlighted some of the main impacts of the Q1 performance overall. The pipeline effect of Xyzal, the new switch allergy product in the U.S. So that was just getting in its pipeline fill into the retail sector at the end of the first quarter. It's obviously a bit too early to indicate there, although the first signs of allergy season in the U.S. are relatively weak. But we're not near the peak season yet which comes in the next 2 or 3 weeks. Cough and cold was strong, but it was strong early. We saw bigger pathology in Europe in November, December. And that carried on through into January, so slightly early season this year compared to previous years. And of course, with the addition of the BI portfolio, we're strong in cough and cold in Europe. So we obviously took advantage of that overall positive pathology. The underlying business, I think, is a strong. And to your comment on the BI franchise, we saw no business disruption in the first couple of months of operation. Everything is going well. We're also on track to deliver the synergy targets as indicated and that will go a long way to raising the margin, as you rightly said, towards the Sanofi standard. As overall, I think everything on track, underlying business looking positive and some seasonality obviously we have to build in but overall on track. Olivier Brandicourt All right. Thank you, Alan. David, Lemtrada? David Meeker Yes, so thanks for the question on Lemtrada. I think, obviously there's a lot of discussion around ocrelizumab, TYSABRI and Lemtrada all falling in what they call the high-efficacy class. I think the impact on Lemtrada is going to be less, to be honest with you, for the following reason. I think there'll be no impact. But Lemtrada is a unique mechanism of action here which is that, I'll remind you, it depletes -- targets anti-CD52, it depletes the white blood cells, T cells and B cells and they come back. And then we believe the mechanism of action is in the repopulation of those white blood cells. The MS is reset so that autoimmune response is no longer seeing MS in quite the same way. And the data for that is we're now at 6 years. So 5 years after your last treatment, we know that 55% to 60-plus percent of the patients from our Phase III trials we've been following long term have not required any additional therapy. So in essence, they have stable MS without any need for further therapy. That's a very different mechanism of action than what is in place with TYSABRI and with ocrelizumab, where you get chronic immunosuppression. So I think there's a lot of questions still.  Again, it's an early therapy. Data is limited when drugs are first launched. We've got 13,500 patients on Lemtrada to date with 8,000 plus, years of follow-up and the like. I think we're going to do fine there. In fact, one hope would be that the presence of ocrelizumab actually drives growth in the high-efficacy class as a whole which is right now only around 10%. So the pipe could go larger, the share of each drug may shift. But overall, the opportunity may be greater. Operator The next question comes from the line of Jack Scannell of UBS. Jack Scannell A couple of questions. First, fitusiran in hemophilia, a couple of things. First, could you just give us an indication as to what gave you confidence that we may not see -- we won't see some of the safety problems with this agent that we've seen in some other novel hemophilia agents? And secondly, do you think the sweet spot is likely to lie in hemophilia A or hemophilia B? And the second question relates to kind of the impact of out-of-pocket costs. It seems that Americans are increasing, I suppose, their out-of-pocket costs, particularly Medicare Part D population and that influences behavior. [indiscernible] patient or Medicare Part D, roughly what would be their incremental monthly out-of-pocket cost? Olivier Brandicourt All right, Jack. Fitusiran question. Elias Zerhouni So we carefully looked at all the data on fitusiran. And frankly, if you look at the #1 safety event for fitusiran, if you remember the mechanism is to reduce the amount of antithrombin, therefore, maintain the thrombus. Then the risk obviously will be thrombogenic risk. We have seen none of that. And because we didn't see any thrombogenic risk and we saw a significant reduction in the antithrombin levels, we felt that it was the right thing to do to continue the trial into Phase III. Obviously, we're monitoring all these patients. So far, we haven't seen any thrombotic risks. So it gives us also the confidence that it will be a very novel therapy because it can truly change the paradigm in many ways, especially in patients who have inhibitors, where other approaches are not working and you can essentially treat these patients with a subcutaneous injection and maintain their status for a time that is still to be determined, a month, 2, 3. So that's why we continued the trial of fitusiran. Olivier Brandicourt All right. Then [indiscernible] of Praluent. Peter Guenter So Praluent or in this case, PCSK9 in general in Medicare Part D, of course, is an issue because with the exception of the low-income subsidy patients which account for about 20% of the total Medicare population, so the remaining 80% has, of course, coinsurance for those products. And to give you an idea for the PCSK9 class, it means that the out-of-pocket payment would be above $3,000 a year, even higher in some cases which is, of course, pretty prohibitive for most of those patients. And we see indeed that there is a huge dropoff, not to say -- well and possibility of even starting the treatment for many of those patients, given the high out-of-pocket for Praluent. Operator The next question comes from the line of Jo Walton of Credit Suisse. Jo Walton Just two remaining questions, please. You have highlighted fantastic performance with your couponing, retaining 43% of share in part of the CVS formulary. Does that antagonize CVS and make it more difficult when you come to negotiate next year? Because their whole rationale is that they can control volumes and this couponing is going against that. So I just wonder if you could tell us a little bit about how you're seeing them fight back? And do you think that United are a better organization at instilling their formulary? Or do you think that we should be able to see you with your couponing retain a significant proportion of United business going forward? And my second question, just result looks at the Established Products. If I look at your European business and your Emerging Markets business, you had a stronger performance in the first quarter with both of these than you have historically had over the last few years. Was there anything or is there anything unusual about the first quarter? Or have we managed to annualize out some of the high declines? And could this be a new level of growth for that established or low declines for that established business? Olivier Brandicourt Okay. Good questions, Jo. So let's go to Diabetes first, couponing in the 43% and 55%. Peter Guenter Thanks for the compliment. It's a lot of good. But of course, whether this antagonizes CVS, as you mentioned, I don't know. I think you should probably refer that question to them. Your question on United, look, I think that it's very hard to predict how this will play out. We, of course, have 3 months more experience now, where we're going to the United part. And again, our objective is to make sure that we have as less a disruption as possible for the patients. So we're just trying to put patients first here with this action. And that's what really matters for us. So I think the other part of your question, I'm afraid I can't really answer. Olivier Brandicourt But the impact on United because the base is different would not be as great as on CVS, right? Peter Guenter Yes. No, I'm more referring to the relative retention we can keep in United with the couponing. So we'll see. But what I'm trying to express is that we have 3 months more experience now that we have, so to speak, exercised for 3 months with CVS. So there's reason to believe that we will be reasonably affected for United. And of course, in parallel, Jo, we work our way through access for Soliqua, of course. And you know that this is the most strategic objective. Olivier Brandicourt All right, thank you. Thank you, Peter. So Olivier, established in emerging and developed countries? Olivier Charmeil So of course, thank you for your question, Jo. So in the mature markets, of course, we're less impacted by the generic competition to Plavix in Japan. And we used quarter-on quarter, year-on-year to lose 40% to 50% in the last quarters. For this quarter, we lose only 30%. Our overall performance for Established Products in mature markets is going to be impacted in the coming months, depending on the entry of potential generic novologs in Europe and in the U.S. for [indiscernible]. Regarding the Emerging Markets, we had a strong performance on our Established Products portfolio, driven by all continents. We have double-digit growth across all continents with a specific note to Brazil and China, very strong performance in China. In China, it's Plavix that continues to grow very nicely as well as the rest of our portfolio, including Lovenox. So strong quarter in the Emerging Markets, reflecting a strong performance in China and in Brazil. But for the mature markets, good performance for the quarter, but we will continue to be impacted by potential entry of generics in the upcoming quarters. Olivier Brandicourt All right. Thank you very much, Olivier. So that's the end of the call. George Grofik Thank you all for dialing in for today's call. Of course, the IR team will be around for the rest of the day to answer as many questions you might have. So that will conclude today's call. Olivier Brandicourt Very good.

Your first question comes from the line of Mr. Florent Cespedes from Societe Generale. Florent Cespedes So two questions. First, for Peter. Could you tell us if you have retained some prescriptions from CVS in the U.S. or if there is a message which to the biosimilar or the novel products in the U.S.? And if not, what is your strategy to potentially come back on some formularies? And maybe a follow-up question on your strategy regarding stimulus [indiscernible] and my second question would be for Olivier. Just to confirm if there is anything new regarding your strategy or M&A strategy and if you're still looking for opportunities? Olivier Brandicourt Thank you, Flor. You want to start, Peter? Yes? Peter Guenter Yes, sure. So first on your question on the retention on CVS. So you remember, we put into place a $10 co-pay strategy for both and Toujeo and we're relatively satisfied with this co-pay program because we have been able to retain in total CVS 55% of our volumes. Now remember, CVS is actually composed of 2 sub-pockets, if you will, the national template and then you have the custom plans, both account for roughly 20 million commercial lives. And out of the custom plans, actually, so out of that 20 million custom plans, we have been able to retain 70% axis as such for Lantus and Toujeo. So in total, 55% retention of TRxs and if you would then drill it down to the national formulary of CVS commercial, where we totally lost access, so we only have the couponing strategy as a mitigation strategy, there we were able to retain 43% of the TRxs. So if you compare this with benchmarks, I think it's fair to say that our couponing program has been relatively successful. Your follow-up question on lease, as I mentioned, already last quarter, so we have been submitted the file in Europe and the MA has accepted the file for evaluation and for concerns in the U.S. for competitive reasons, we cannot give any additional background on that. Olivier Brandicourt Thank you. Thank you, Peter. So to your question regarding M&A. Yes, I can confirm that nothing has really changed. We're continuing to focus on creating value for shareholders. Our main driver -- main drivers are the strategic fit as we presented in November 2015, right? So looking at strengthening our business in IRTAs where we have already some level of leadership or others where we're looking at building competitive positions and that is MS, oncology, immunology and CHC. When it comes to value creation to shareholder, we said it also last time, we want to remain financially disciplined and we're solidly looking at deals where we strongly believe we can achieve a return on invested capital exceeding ROI. And finally, driver is of course the pipeline because Sanofi pipeline has been significantly strengthened over the last few years, but we believe our R&D capabilities could be further enhanced. Operator The next question comes from the line of Mr. Graham Parry of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Graham Parry So firstly, on Diabetes, could you quantify the incremental volume loss that we should expect in the second quarter from the UnitedHealth contract, taking in any incremental impacts from CVS that you were referring to? And any initial 2018 contracting commentary you can give us, how that's going, how you're prioritizing pricing versus access, especially given the need to get Soliqua access, too? And then secondly, on the Praluent, if you could just give us a feel for what's driving the delay on ODYSSEY, is that just an event rate update happening slower? Do you think you can still get this data in time for ACC and in time for 2019 contracting negotiations? Olivier Brandicourt Thank you, Graham. So the first question, for you, Peter and the OTC question for Elias. Peter Guenter Yes, Graham, so thanks for the question. And the number of lives in United commercial is actually 60 million. So this is less than, for example, the CVS commercial lives, 40 million. You should also know that Toujeo was not covered at United, contrary to Lantus. And of course, we were in a Tier 3 position, so we suspect the impact of United to be less important than the impact of CVS. So your question on 2018 contracting, of course, it is very early to comment on that. As you know, we have, of course, submitted our bids. And we'll have to wait until we get the results of those bids. And in terms of prioritization, we, of course, have a strategy of keeping a large coverage for many reasons, not only for Lantus and Toujeo, but also in the future for Soliqua. I think the Praluent question is for... Elias Zerhouni Yes, Graham, for OTC, nothing has really changed. As you know, it's an event-driven trial. And we do want to absolutely perform this trial in the best possible way because I think it's critical for the field that we accumulate the best scientific experience and data to enlighten us in terms of the value of PCSK9. So we were hoping, as you remember, to complete all of the events by models that we had by the end of the year. It's clear that we will be able to recruit all the events by the end of the year. But then you have a certain amount of time to analyze that data. On your question about ACC, we're making every effort to be able to present at the ACC. But because it's really beyond our control where the events are and their adjudication, I can't promise. But that's my hope. Graham Parry Okay, so no change at all in the number of events or follow-up [indiscernible] the study there? Elias Zerhouni Absolutely not, no. Operator The next question comes from the line of Vincent Meunier of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Meunier Three questions, please. The first question is on Diabetes. So you've clearly highlighted the deeper decline expected this year in Diabetes and particularly for the remainder of 2017. Has anything changed recently which would make you more cautious? Or is your message today just to reiterate what you said before? Because my feeling is that your tone today is a bit more cautious than before. The second question is on Multiple Sclerosis. Can you comment on the pricing trend for Aubagio and also the price environment in MS in general going forward? And the last question is a follow-up on strategy. The follow-up question on M&A, I mean, you said earlier that you might continue buyback and renew buyback if you're not in a position to find a suitable target. Is it still a valid comment? Olivier Brandicourt All right. Thank you, Vincent. On Diabetes, I don't think there is anything new that we're trying to convey today. We just wanted to highlight the Q1 results, the equation of that good result is it was a minus 6% result and it's minus 15% in the U.S., offset by a plus 12% or 13% in China. So we have that momentum in China. Are we going to see that for the rest of the year? We're not entirely sure. And then in the U.S., the indication is what we're trying to convey. We have these formulary decisions which we learned in last August regarding UnitedHealthcare which has not had any impact during Q1. And we see that during the rest of the year, in addition again of CVS which was only partially, had only a partial impact in Q1. And I think maybe, Peter, you can also provide more color around how much more prescription do we have in the government channel, like Medicaid and if you want to add color around whether or not that has changed versus what we conveyed in the past. Peter Guenter No, I think overall we can say that we're actually in line with our expectations. I think you mentioned the 2 key points, Olivier, of the reasons of the deceleration in the U.S. that we forecast in the year-to-go which is, of course, a full impact of CVS. The first quarter was only a partial impact, right? It started to slide actually as of the last 1 or 2 weeks of December. And then we have the additional impact of UnitedHealthcare. It is true that the channel mix remains unfavorable but not more unfavorable than we have anticipated. But of course, as the year unwinds, you get more sales in unprofitable channels. So it's normal in your net sales that you get an acceleration of the decrease. And perhaps the last piece we can provide is that we stick with our long term guidance of minus 4% to minus 8% and CAGR, 15% to 18%. But we also remind you, like we reminded to you in the last quarter, is that for the year 2017, we will be probably below the lower end of that long-range guidance. Olivier Brandicourt Okay, thank you, Peter. David, do you want to answer the Aubagio question? David Meeker Yes. So with regard to pricing, I mean, we all know there's much more focus on pricing in the U.S. overall, so it's obviously a point of debate. I think with regard to the MS class specifically, it is part of that discussion. Fundamentally, nothing has changed as of now. The things I'd remind you of is Aubagio itself is the lowest-priced oral with further discounting off the WACC, of course. And from a dataset standpoint, it's the only oral that had a hit on confirmed disability reduction in both Phase III trials, prevention of progression there. So it has a strong dataset. ICER evaluated the class and concluded that the platform therapies and the orals did not meet cost-effective criteria. But I think this was a good example where we're still in dialogue with them. I think we'd have some concerns about the numbers that they actually used to do that calculation and perhaps not recognizing the full value of Aubagio. And Aubagio, just again to remind you, it's 9% market share in the U.S., fastest-growing oral and 11% in new scripts. So I think the Aubagio picture still remains extremely strong. And conversely, on the pricing standpoint in the ICER evaluation, Lemtrada was the one product in the MS class which was judged cost-effective and by a very large margin. So that's it. Olivier Brandicourt All right. Thank you, David. And Vincent, for your last question, so you heard Jérôme. So we have bought back share at the value of 2.8 billion, 2.9 billion since we announced the share buyback program. That included what we did in Q4 last year to the tune of 1.5 billion and a further 1.3 billion, 1.4 billion as of mid-April. It's actually 1.4 billion. Now to your specific question, I think we can keep in mind that we can always look at opportunistic purchases once we have reached 3.5 billion figure. However, when it comes to the priority of allocation, M&A remains above the share buyback allocation. And you expressed a potential case where we would find anything. But again, we're, as you would expect, looking into different TAs I was mentioning before. And that can eventually happen. So that's what I would answer. That's what I would respond. Operator The next question comes from the line of Mr. Richard Vosser of JPMorgan. Richard Vosser Just a follow-up on Soliqua, please, just you mentioned the formulary access last quarter and kicking in from July. So just perhaps if you could give us an update on how that access discussion is going at the moment, please? And then secondly, just on the Dupixent data mentioned in the press release from the CAFÉ trial, could you just clarify the meaning of the acceptable safety profile? Have you seen a different safety profile in this trial compared to the previous Phase III trials which has obviously been very good. Just some clarity there would be very useful. Olivier Brandicourt Okay. Thank you, Richard. Soliqua access, yes, Peter? Peter Guenter So Soliqua access, what we've seen is that some payers tried to look at the 2 products, so Soliqua and Xultophy, together. So they are kind of delaying their decision in terms of access. This being said, with what we know today, we know that we have 34% commercial access and 31% R&D access already signed but not necessarily all in place. Some of that is yet to come into effect. And actually, during the first quarter, there was actually no access with the exception of the last 2 weeks of the first quarter. So what you see actually in net sales, of course, was Soliqua is underestimated because of the couponing part, the $0 co-pay which of course, offsets against net sales. Perhaps one additional word on Soliqua, it's obviously very early days. We're only a couple of weeks out of the gate. But it's clear that in terms of patient identification, you know that the product has in its label the intensification space, right, so either patients not [indiscernible] with basal insulin alone, so patients where you would either up-titrate with your basal insulin or intensify them, for example, by adding a GLP-1 or a prandial insulin. So that is actually the sweet spot for Soliqua. But that requires a bit of education of our physicians. So that's really what we're focusing on as we speak.  And we see that after a certain number of visits, they got that message. So what I'm trying to say is that, of course, the access which is gradual and the education of our customer bases will require some time. And therefore, you will see a gradual uptake of Soliqua. Elias Zerhouni So for the CAFÉ safety profile, we did not observe any significant difference in the safety profile in CAFÉ as the others. So nothing to report there. Olivier Brandicourt Nothing to report, okay. Operator The next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Holford of Jefferies. Jeffrey Holford Wonder if you'd like to just comment around the strategy for consumer regarding M&A, whether you have appetite to do business development there immediately or whether you'll need to sort of see through 2017 before you're ready to integrate more transactions. And then actually just would like to step back a moment, just talk more broadly about your Oncology strategy, whether there are specific areas you feel you want to intensify in terms of product additions and development and whether there are specific areas, like hematology or solid tumors in particular, you feel is more attractive for you to focus on. Olivier Brandicourt All right. So on the CHC strategies, definitely we're busy integrating this relatively large business portfolio from BI. We're going that well and Alan is managing his team very effectively. And you can see already that through the results we're posting for this quarter that it's working well. Does that mean that in the midterm or longer term, we wouldn't look at eventually strengthening even further this business? Of course not. So we would be open. As I said, CHC is part of the TAs and areas we wanted to strengthen. We have done definitely a very important step there. But it might not be the end of the story and opportunities will be critical or will determine the future of that aspect. So that's for CHC. Do you want to answer the question on Oncology, Elias? Elias Zerhouni Sure. Yes, let me first state that the Oncology strategy is a multi-tier strategy, multiphase. First and foremost, we're going to continue to develop the franchise around CD38. And when you asked the question, as you know, CD38 is for myeloma. But science shows that it has other potential indications, such as in other hematological malignancies and we're going to explore that as well as combined with PD-1 in which we're already starting some early work, it is actually possible to see indications in tumors, in solid tumors. And the reason is that science is showing that CD38 seems to be in itself a checkpoint inhibitor. And this is what the -- is driving, if you will, the growth of this very important pillar. In addition, we will continue our own internal programs in antibody drug conjugates. We're in talk stage for those.  Second, we're going to build the immuno-oncology franchise on 2 axes. One, obviously, is the collaboration with Regeneron which gives us the checkpoint inhibitors we need, PD-1 and LAG3. And then combined with our own internal assets which are immune activators, if you will, our TGF-beta antibody, our neukine and other approaches that we're putting together which will complement, if you will, the effort with Regeneron. Third, we believe that there is an opportunity in Oncology to perhaps acquire some assets that will be complementary to our portfolio. So we're looking at opportunities that will be complementary strategically to our prostate portfolio, for example and our breast cancer portfolio. We have both internal and external programs that we're looking at for that purpose. So that's the approach. We're building on what we have. We're continuing to build on a complementary strategy to that of the Regeneron, Sanofi collaboration. We will build the part of it that is immune activating. And on top of that, we'll build the multi-targeting strategies that seem to become the dominant approach in cancer control. Olivier Brandicourt Do you want to add a word on the ADC platform we have? Elias Zerhouni Right. So the antibody drug conjugate platform is in the clinic right now. We have 3 of them. And we have early promising clinical data that will be expanded further. And clearly, those are assets that we will continue to explore. Operator Next question comes from the line of Luisa Hector of Exane BNP Paribas. Luisa Hector On Dupixent, can you confirm whether the CAFÉ results are actually required to get the European approval by the end of the year? And then on Diabetes, the glargine franchise, I'm just wondering that now we're sort of seeing more developments in the competitive landscape with BASAGLAR, Soliqua, Xultophy, whether there's any change to your target market share that the Toujeo switch can achieve and whether perhaps Soliqua -- you have a bit more confidence in Soliqua perhaps taking more share than you expected now that we have more information on all the dynamics there. Olivier Brandicourt All right. Thank you, Luisa. Elias, maybe you should answer the regulatory question around CAFÉ. Elias Zerhouni Yes, CAFÉ was, in fact, a requirement of the EMA. In Europe, they do want you to conduct trials against established standard of care, in this case, even nonestablished standard of care [indiscernible] cyclosporine. So it was a requirement of EMA, yes. Peter Guenter Luisa, your question on Toujeo and, let's say, insulins in general with the increased competition in the field of Diabetes. We stick to our initial thinking. So we think that Toujeo is sufficiently differentiated to make the mark. We're happy with the initial launch of this product. It continues to perform extremely well in Europe. We take very significant market shares. We're coming back to very good performances in Japan. We have been making our first launches in Emerging Markets, where the expectation of the product is also a very good. And the interesting thing is that despite all the new competition in the field of Diabetes in general is that the overall insulin market in volumes, even in the U.S., continues to grow 3%, 4%, 5% depending on the quarter. So that's number one. Number two, in countries where we have more maturity with Toujeo, you take, for example, Germany which was the first launch country in Europe, you see, of course, in the beginning that the first source of business for Toujeo is switches from basal insulin and, of course, to the large extent, Lantus. But you see also that moving forward, that Toujeo captures more and more new patients.  For example, today in Germany, the source of business is already 2/3 new patients, right which of course, is an interesting, let's say, opportunity for us to take if you take -- if you look at the overall glargine franchise of Sanofi. So number two on Soliqua, again I provided some early insights, too, in the previous question. Again, it's early days. Don't forget that in the U.S., so FDA did not give us the first injectable label, so post-OAD label, whereas in Europe, we have both the post-OAD label and the insulin intensification label. So that is a fundamental difference of appreciation between EMA and FDA because, of course, the file obviously was the same. So that is basically what I can tell you. Operator Next question comes from the line of Philippe Lanone of Natixis. Philippe Lanone Two remaining ones. First, on CHC, we have a strong growth. However, 40% of that is Xyzal launch. And if we strip out also the strong flu season, probably the underlying growth still is a bit weak. Or is it? And how do you -- can we see that going forward? And can you comment on how the BI business is doing and whether you still maintain the target of bringing the margins of BI to the former Sanofi has won in this business? And another question on Lemtrada which is doing pretty well and accelerating this quarter, while some of the competitors have signaled some weakness in Multiple Sclerosis market on the wake of OCREVU.S. launch by Roche, it should be, I mean, the main target commercially for OCREVU.S.. How do you see this product going forward with this competition? Olivier Brandicourt All right. Thank you for your good questions. So CHC, Alan? Alan Main Obviously, you highlighted some of the main impacts of the Q1 performance overall. The pipeline effect of Xyzal, the new switch allergy product in the U.S. So that was just getting in its pipeline fill into the retail sector at the end of the first quarter. It's obviously a bit too early to indicate there, although the first signs of allergy season in the U.S. are relatively weak. But we're not near the peak season yet which comes in the next 2 or 3 weeks. Cough and cold was strong, but it was strong early. We saw bigger pathology in Europe in November, December. And that carried on through into January, so slightly early season this year compared to previous years. And of course, with the addition of the BI portfolio, we're strong in cough and cold in Europe. So we obviously took advantage of that overall positive pathology. The underlying business, I think, is a strong. And to your comment on the BI franchise, we saw no business disruption in the first couple of months of operation. Everything is going well. We're also on track to deliver the synergy targets as indicated and that will go a long way to raising the margin, as you rightly said, towards the Sanofi standard. As overall, I think everything on track, underlying business looking positive and some seasonality obviously we have to build in but overall on track. Olivier Brandicourt All right. Thank you, Alan. David, Lemtrada? David Meeker Yes, so thanks for the question on Lemtrada. I think, obviously there's a lot of discussion around ocrelizumab, TYSABRI and Lemtrada all falling in what they call the high-efficacy class. I think the impact on Lemtrada is going to be less, to be honest with you, for the following reason. I think there'll be no impact. But Lemtrada is a unique mechanism of action here which is that, I'll remind you, it depletes -- targets anti-CD52, it depletes the white blood cells, T cells and B cells and they come back. And then we believe the mechanism of action is in the repopulation of those white blood cells. The MS is reset so that autoimmune response is no longer seeing MS in quite the same way. And the data for that is we're now at 6 years. So 5 years after your last treatment, we know that 55% to 60-plus percent of the patients from our Phase III trials we've been following long term have not required any additional therapy. So in essence, they have stable MS without any need for further therapy. That's a very different mechanism of action than what is in place with TYSABRI and with ocrelizumab, where you get chronic immunosuppression. So I think there's a lot of questions still.  Again, it's an early therapy. Data is limited when drugs are first launched. We've got 13,500 patients on Lemtrada to date with 8,000 plus, years of follow-up and the like. I think we're going to do fine there. In fact, one hope would be that the presence of ocrelizumab actually drives growth in the high-efficacy class as a whole which is right now only around 10%. So the pipe could go larger, the share of each drug may shift. But overall, the opportunity may be greater. Operator The next question comes from the line of Jack Scannell of UBS. Jack Scannell A couple of questions. First, fitusiran in hemophilia, a couple of things. First, could you just give us an indication as to what gave you confidence that we may not see -- we won't see some of the safety problems with this agent that we've seen in some other novel hemophilia agents? And secondly, do you think the sweet spot is likely to lie in hemophilia A or hemophilia B? And the second question relates to kind of the impact of out-of-pocket costs. It seems that Americans are increasing, I suppose, their out-of-pocket costs, particularly Medicare Part D population and that influences behavior. [indiscernible] patient or Medicare Part D, roughly what would be their incremental monthly out-of-pocket cost? Olivier Brandicourt All right, Jack. Fitusiran question. Elias Zerhouni So we carefully looked at all the data on fitusiran. And frankly, if you look at the #1 safety event for fitusiran, if you remember the mechanism is to reduce the amount of antithrombin, therefore, maintain the thrombus. Then the risk obviously will be thrombogenic risk. We have seen none of that. And because we didn't see any thrombogenic risk and we saw a significant reduction in the antithrombin levels, we felt that it was the right thing to do to continue the trial into Phase III. Obviously, we're monitoring all these patients. So far, we haven't seen any thrombotic risks. So it gives us also the confidence that it will be a very novel therapy because it can truly change the paradigm in many ways, especially in patients who have inhibitors, where other approaches are not working and you can essentially treat these patients with a subcutaneous injection and maintain their status for a time that is still to be determined, a month, 2, 3. So that's why we continued the trial of fitusiran. Olivier Brandicourt All right. Then [indiscernible] of Praluent. Peter Guenter So Praluent or in this case, PCSK9 in general in Medicare Part D, of course, is an issue because with the exception of the low-income subsidy patients which account for about 20% of the total Medicare population, so the remaining 80% has, of course, coinsurance for those products. And to give you an idea for the PCSK9 class, it means that the out-of-pocket payment would be above $3,000 a year, even higher in some cases which is, of course, pretty prohibitive for most of those patients. And we see indeed that there is a huge dropoff, not to say -- well and possibility of even starting the treatment for many of those patients, given the high out-of-pocket for Praluent. Operator The next question comes from the line of Jo Walton of Credit Suisse. Jo Walton Just two remaining questions, please. You have highlighted fantastic performance with your couponing, retaining 43% of share in part of the CVS formulary. Does that antagonize CVS and make it more difficult when you come to negotiate next year? Because their whole rationale is that they can control volumes and this couponing is going against that. So I just wonder if you could tell us a little bit about how you're seeing them fight back? And do you think that United are a better organization at instilling their formulary? Or do you think that we should be able to see you with your couponing retain a significant proportion of United business going forward? And my second question, just result looks at the Established Products. If I look at your European business and your Emerging Markets business, you had a stronger performance in the first quarter with both of these than you have historically had over the last few years. Was there anything or is there anything unusual about the first quarter? Or have we managed to annualize out some of the high declines? And could this be a new level of growth for that established or low declines for that established business? Olivier Brandicourt Okay. Good questions, Jo. So let's go to Diabetes first, couponing in the 43% and 55%. Peter Guenter Thanks for the compliment. It's a lot of good. But of course, whether this antagonizes CVS, as you mentioned, I don't know. I think you should probably refer that question to them. Your question on United, look, I think that it's very hard to predict how this will play out. We, of course, have 3 months more experience now, where we're going to the United part. And again, our objective is to make sure that we have as less a disruption as possible for the patients. So we're just trying to put patients first here with this action. And that's what really matters for us. So I think the other part of your question, I'm afraid I can't really answer. Olivier Brandicourt But the impact on United because the base is different would not be as great as on CVS, right? Peter Guenter Yes. No, I'm more referring to the relative retention we can keep in United with the couponing. So we'll see. But what I'm trying to express is that we have 3 months more experience now that we have, so to speak, exercised for 3 months with CVS. So there's reason to believe that we will be reasonably affected for United. And of course, in parallel, Jo, we work our way through access for Soliqua, of course. And you know that this is the most strategic objective. Olivier Brandicourt All right, thank you. Thank you, Peter. So Olivier, established in emerging and developed countries? Olivier Charmeil So of course, thank you for your question, Jo. So in the mature markets, of course, we're less impacted by the generic competition to Plavix in Japan. And we used quarter-on quarter, year-on-year to lose 40% to 50% in the last quarters. For this quarter, we lose only 30%. Our overall performance for Established Products in mature markets is going to be impacted in the coming months, depending on the entry of potential generic novologs in Europe and in the U.S. for [indiscernible]. Regarding the Emerging Markets, we had a strong performance on our Established Products portfolio, driven by all continents. We have double-digit growth across all continents with a specific note to Brazil and China, very strong performance in China. In China, it's Plavix that continues to grow very nicely as well as the rest of our portfolio, including Lovenox. So strong quarter in the Emerging Markets, reflecting a strong performance in China and in Brazil. But for the mature markets, good performance for the quarter, but we will continue to be impacted by potential entry of generics in the upcoming quarters. Olivier Brandicourt All right. Thank you very much, Olivier. So that's the end of the call. George Grofik Thank you all for dialing in for today's call. Of course, the IR team will be around for the rest of the day to answer as many questions you might have. So that will conclude today's call. Olivier Brandicourt Very good.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cody, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Please go ahead, sir. Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc. Thank you, Cody. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today, then we'll have a question-and-answer session. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived on our website through June 2. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known, as well as unknown, risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings release. Finally, unless otherwise noted, all percentage changes that we discussed will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. It was another good quarter in terms of our financial results, with both revenues and earnings per share exceeding our guidance. And it was a transformational quarter from a strategic perspective as we made tremendous progress in three areas that will help drive the next chapter of our sustainable growth story: International expansion, our R&D pipeline, and business development. It's a testament to the strength and dedication of our team that we delivered constant currency growth in core revenues, excluding blood screening and Cynosure, of 5.4% and EPS growth of 21.6% while simultaneously building new global capabilities, launching multiple new products, and closing two major deals. All in all, this was the busiest and most productive quarter we've had since I joined Hologic more than three years ago, and our accomplishments accelerate our transformation into a sustainably higher growth company. With that introduction, now, I'd like to provide an overview of our second quarter revenue results highlighting international and new products. Then, I'll discuss growth opportunities at Cynosure before handing the call over to Bob. In the second quarter, reported revenue of $715.4 million grew 3.2% on a reported basis, or 3.8% in constant currency. This includes partial quarter contributions from both Cynosure and blood screening. If you were to back out Cynosure sales, revenue would have been $699.4 million, exceeding our most recent guidance of $675 million to $685 million. Of this amount, revenues from our divested blood screening business totaled $38.3 million, down markedly from the prior period  prior year period, but still about $10 million higher than expected. Net of these, as we said, revenue in our core business grew 4.7% on a reported basis, or 5.4% in constant currency. As you've seen in recent periods, our ongoing efforts to both revitalize and reshape our portfolio paid dividends again in the second quarter. As a reminder, if we rewind to 2015, it was our U.S. Breast Health division that drove growth behind the rapid adoption of Genius 3D mammography. As this growth driver slowed last year, Surgical emerge to pick up the slack. And now, in the second quarter, as Surgical annualized some competitive benefits, our molecular diagnostics and international businesses both stepped up to post double-digit growth rates, with Cynosure waiting in the wings for the future. With that context, let's provide some quarterly revenue details. Growth in the second quarter was led by molecular diagnostics where global sales of $142.1 million, increased an exceptional 13.3%. In the United States, where sales increased at a low double-digit rate, our commercial team is doing an excellent job of cross-selling our full product portfolio, gaining market share behind our fully automated Panther system and expanding the market by driving compliance with testing guidelines. Outside the U.S., where sales grew more than 20% for the third time in four quarters, we continue to see the benefits of healthy Panther placements and multiple new product introductions. Our Surgical division also performed well again with global sales of $101.1 million, increasing 11.9%, our ninth straight quarter of double-digit growth. NovaSure sales were basically flat as expected, as we have annualized the benefit of a competitive recall, but MyoSure continues to shine, with global sales growth again in excess of 30%. In terms of geography, international sales really emerged as a growth driver in the quarter, growing 11.1%, excluding blood screening and Cynosure. While we still have a lot of work ahead of us, let me remind you that over the past 12 months, we have hired four new commercial leaders for Latin America, Asia-Pacific, Canada and Europe. These leaders have been busy building the foundation for strong and sustainable growth in the years ahead, while already putting a few wins on the board. While molecular diagnostics and Surgical led the global growth this quarter, we also believe that our international Breast Health business is improving as new leadership works on a country by country basis to optimize channel strategies and strengthen our commercial capabilities. International Breast Health sales increased at a mid single-digit rate in the second quarter. And the opportunities ahead of us remain robust. To further capitalize on these opportunities, in April, we acquired Medicor, our long-time distributor of breast and skeletal health products in Germany, Austria and Switzerland Although this is a small acquisition, it provides us a nice platform for future growth by giving us direct access to our customers and full control over commercial strategy. In addition, it's a good example of the kind of tuck-in acquisitions that we continue to pursue, even after the larger Cynosure deal. So, while we are not yet declaring victory outside the United States, I can honestly say that for the first time since I joined the company, we can see clear capabilities to drive strong and sustainable growth in our international business in the quarters and years ahead. Another reason we are optimistic about our future prospects, both internationally and domestically, is the steady cadence of new products beginning to emerge from our R&D pipeline. For example, sales of new products continue to increase and exceeded $25 million in the second quarter, led by MyoSure REACH and the Affirm prone biopsy system. While this revenue is obviously not all incremental, we are nonetheless pleased with our progress and we continue to add more new products. In the second quarter, we launched our next-generation NovaSure ADVANCED product in the United States. We announced FDA approvals of two important new diagnostic assays, our viral load tests for HIV-1 and the hepatitis C virus. And we continue to expect U.S. regulatory clearance for our hepatitis B assay next year. Now, let me turn to our third major initiative, business development. As you can imagine, closing both the blood screening divestiture and the Cynosure acquisition in a single quarter was no small feat, and I'd like to publicly thank our team for all the hard work and long hours involved. Together, these two deals de-risk our product portfolio, will accelerate our long-term growth rates and provide us opportunities to expand profit margins. Overall, they have made us a fundamentally stronger company. Cynosure added $16 million of revenue to our second quarter results based on sales recorded after the acquisition closed. For the full March quarter, however, Cynosure sales totaled only $77 million. Although the March quarter is seasonally weak for Cynosure, sales also were negatively affected by the significant distraction that began early in the quarter when a media outlet reported that Cynosure was in talks to be acquired. These negotiations clearly distracted management's attention and resulted in unusually high turnover in the sales force, as well as delayed hiring of new reps. Together, these changes had a significant but transient effect on revenue. With the deal now closed, we've made great progress on stabilizing the sales force, just as we did with Hologic three years ago. And also like Hologic, the Cynosure sales force has innovative, market-leading products to work with. Looking beyond this March quarter blip, which doesn't affect Hologic's results anyway, we see two huge positives in Cynosure, an attractive growing market and technological leadership that has led to great products. Cynosure has tapped into and helped create a movement toward less invasive aesthetic treatments, an area that we believe has tremendous growth potential for many years ahead. In terms of the market, medical aesthetics growth is being driven by major societal trends, an aging population, higher levels of disposable income, and a focus on personal appearance in a world of selfies. And even after Allergan's acquisition of ZELTIQ which, by the way, operates only in the body sculpting segment, the overall aesthetics market remain highly fragmented. Cynosure has become the clear leader in the overall market, thanks to its deep expertise in lasers, which in turn has produced best-in-class products. Cynosure's core competency is identifying customer needs and finding products to meet them, either through organic innovation or external business development. I'd like to highlight three of these Cynosure products now. These products serve as the foundation for the revenue categories that we will disclose going forward, body contouring, skin and women's health and other. We're hopeful that as we provide more transparency on Cynosure's products and business, you'll come to share our excitement about our future in medical aesthetics. In non-invasive body contouring, most of you are familiar with SculpSure, a 1060 nanometer laser that was launched in late 2015. This is a large market today, totaling over $1 billion, but it remains very underpenetrated. So, we believe there is more than enough room for multiple players. This is especially true given the inherent competitive advantages of SculpSure, which have been demonstrated by roughly 1,400 unit placements and very solid head-to-head performance since launch. In addition, we believe that SculpSure has many opportunities for future growth. For example, we recently filed for regulatory approval to use this system on the back for bra fat and on the inner and outer thighs. We also are completing clinical trials for an indication to use SculpSure under the chin in what's the called the submental area. We expect that SculpSure's efficacy in this area will be a further competitive differentiator, and hope to receive regulatory clearance in the first half of fiscal 2018. Finally, let me mention that we believe we can help drive consumer demand for SculpSure, building on the successes we've had with Genius 3D Mammography. As this demand built, we expect to sell an increasing number of disposables, known as PAC keys, associated with the system thereby boosting sales and profitability. In fact, we're pleased that consumable sales began to pick up in the last quarter. The second product I want to highlight, one that may be overlooked by the investment community, is PicoSure. After years of internal development at Cynosure, PicoSure was the first picosecond laser approved by the FDA in 2013, and it remains the gold standard today, with about 1,000 placements in the field and 1 million patients treated worldwide. Unlike traditional lasers which rely on intense heat that can generate significant redness and downtime, PicoSure is a gentler option that activates the body's natural cellular response to revitalize skin with minimal discomfort and downtime. PicoSure has been used mainly for tattoo removal historically and is differentiated because it employs different wavelengths that can remove all colors of tattoo ink from various skin types. But PicoSure is increasingly being used for skin revitalization, the removal of pigmented lesions, acne scars and wrinkles, especially on the face. As shown by a number of studies presented recently at the Annual Meeting of the ASLMS, PicoSure and the disposable focus lens array generate similar or better results in nanosecond lasers, but with fewer treatments and less downtime. We believe the market here could become very large as we educate providers and patients about the differentiated benefits of PicoSure. Almost everyone can benefit from facial skin revitalization, and patient satisfaction is exceptionally high. In addition, PicoSure has significant potential outside the United States. In China, for example, PicoSure has been approved for tattoo removal, but we intend to submit for regulatory approval for pigmented lesions later this year. The third product I want to highlight is MonaLisa Touch, a fractional CO2 laser that is used to treat the painful symptoms of menopause, as well as women with vaginal problems following a hysterectomy or breast cancer treatments. The product, which we distribute for the Italian company El.En., delivers controlled laser energy to the vaginal wall to promote collagen generation and rejuvenate the vaginal mucosa. At the risk of sounding too bullish, the market for this product could be enormous. In the United States alone, more than 30 million women experience genitourinary symptoms of menopause or GSM, which is also called vaginal atrophy. In terms of potential domestic placements, Cynosure has sold roughly 700 MonaLisa Touch systems to date out of an estimated 16,000 women's health focused practices. And for many women, the therapy can be truly life-changing, as evidenced by 18 published studies and many other trials currently underway. MonaLisa Touch was rapidly adopted in 2015 in its first year after launch, but sales stalled in 2016 as new competitors entered the market and Cynosure devoted sales resources to SculpSure. We believe the product can do much better as part of Hologic, where we can leverage our large OB/GYN sales force to generate leads among our customer base we know very well. Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me summarize by saying that we are excited about the current and future opportunities for Cynosure to grow in the medical aesthetics market. Similarly, we remain enthusiastic about the potential of our R&D pipeline, as well as the momentum that is building internationally. We made tremendous progress on all these fronts in the second quarter, while simultaneously posting revenue and earnings result that exceeded expectations. Now, I will turn the call over to Bob. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to highlight some of our other divisional sales drivers, walk through our second quarter income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics and then finish up with our updated financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Steve mentioned, we posted good financial results in our second quarter, highlighted by 5.4% constant currency growth in our core business, when you exclude blood screening and Cynosure. Steve already highlighted molecular diagnostics and Surgical, so I'll start my discussion with Breast Health. Global Breast Health sales up $280.5 million, increased 2.1% in constant currency against the challenging prior year comp. In the United States, incremental placements of 3D gantries continued to moderate, like in recent quarters, as we pursue smaller, more price-sensitive customers. But at the same time, booking trends remained solid, and our backlog is healthy. In addition, more than 75% of American women in our target patient population now have incremental insurance coverage for 3D, which we believe will solidify even broader market adoption over time. Also in the second quarter, Breast Health service revenue again benefited from an expanding installed base in the U.S. with low double-digit growth year-over-year, while sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system continue to build. And as Steve mentioned, international Breast Health sales grew at a mid single digit rate for the first time in over a year as new leadership continues to make good progress in optimizing our distributor relationships. Now, moving on to cytology and perinatal. Global revenues of $115.6 million were essentially flat in constant currency. The story here really hasn't changed much. We maintain very high market shares domestically, yet still face headwinds, albeit moderating from longer cervical cancer screening guidelines intervals, and we see significant opportunities outside the U.S. both to increase market share within liquid-based cytology and to drive conversion from traditional Pap tests over time. To wrap up the revenue discussion, Skeletal Health revenues of $21.8 million decreased 1%, a slight improvement over disappointing results in the first quarter. Now, moving down the P&L. Gross margins of 63.9%, decreased 190 basis points compared to the prior year, mainly due to the blood screening divestiture, the negative impact of a stronger dollar and product mix. Total operating expenses of $223 million were up slightly compared to the prior year, mainly due to the addition of the partial quarter Cynosure expenses at the end of the quarter. Beyond this, operating expenses remained well-controlled, helping to support a very healthy operating margin of 32.7% in the quarter. And to round out the discussion of the income statement, a lower effective tax and a slightly reduced share count enabled us to once again increase EPS at a multiple of sales growth. Specifically, reported EPS of $0.50 grew 6.4% compared to a year ago, double the rate of reported sales growth. As noted in our press release, blood screening contributed $0.04 to EPS. So, if you back this out, along with $0.01 from Cynosure, you can see that non-GAAP EPS in our core business grew by more than 20%. I'll quickly touch on a few key financial metrics, beginning with the balance sheet. Total debt decreased $123 million compared to the prior year. We are very proud that we were able to fund the Cynosure acquisition with cash from the blood screening divestiture, with no need to increase debt. Our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, currently stands at 2.1 times, although that number would be approximately 2.7 this quarter if we were to adjust for the roughly $650 million in taxes on the gain from our blood screening divestiture. We remain comfortable with our debt level and strong cash flow generation. We believe we have more than enough capacity to continue to pursue small tuck-in acquisitions like Medicor, eliminate our convertible debt, and opportunistically act on our outstanding share repurchase authorization. Now, before moving to our updated financial guidance, let me mention that adjusted EBITDA was $255.9 million in the second quarter, an increase of 0.8% compared to the prior year. And return on invested capital was 13.2% on a trailing 12-month basis, a 150 basis point improvement over the prior year. Finally, let's turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and the third quarter, and begin with our full year sales guidance. As a reminder, our previous guidance range of $2.785 billion to $2.825 billion included mid single-digit constant currency growth for our core business, once you back out sales from our divested blood screen franchise. Now, as we move to the fiscal third quarter, there are a few moving pieces, especially the addition of Cynosure, but our view of the core business remains constant, with an expectation of mid single-digit growth. So, taking into our account our Q2 results and adding Cynosure, we now expect reported revenue of $3.05 billion to $3.08 billion in fiscal 2017, representing a reported growth rate of 7.7% to 8.7%. Based on recent exchange rates, this equates to high single-digit constant currency growth of between 8.4% and 9.5%. Included in our updated sales guidance is roughly $115 million to $125 million from our divested blood screening business, higher than our previous guidance, due mainly to the stronger performance in the second quarter. Also included in our guidance is an estimated full year contribution of $235 million to $245 million from Cynosure. Now, this may prove to be a conservative estimate, but we want to give ourselves some time to master the cadence of the business, as well as acknowledge that recently hired sales representatives will need some time to get up to speed. Also as a reminder, Cynosure's December quarter, our first quarter of fiscal 2018, is typically their seasonally strongest. Now, let's move on to our revised EPS guidance for the full year. As a reminder, our previous guidance range of $1.90 to $1.94 included roughly $0.13 related to blood screening. We are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to a range between $1.98 and $2.02, which includes a $0.14 contribution from blood screening and a Cynosure impact of between $0.03 and $0.05 as previously communicated. Please note that while we will continue to see blood screening revenue throughout the year as we fulfill our contractual obligations to Grifols, these sales will have a minimal impact on EPS. So again, by way of illustration, if you were to back out blood screening EPS from this year's forecast and last year's and also remove our Cynosure estimates at their midpoint, our forecast continues to imply reported EPS growth rates for our core business in the mid-teens on an apples to apples basis. Now, I'd also like to provide some color on the non-GAAP margins that are embedded in our guidance following the blood screening divestiture and the Cynosure acquisition. In terms of gross margins, blood screening was more profitable than our corporate average, while Cynosure is lower. Netting these out, our second quarter gross margin should be a good base from which to build going forward. It's important to note that the product mix for Cynosure is in the early stages of shifting from hardware to higher margin consumables, so we expect profitability to improve over time. In terms of the overall company operating margin line, we carried minimal operating expense for blood screening, while Cynosure invests heavily in sales and marketing. As a result, we expect operating margins of around 30% in the back half of the year. This remains one of the best operating margins amongst our peers, and as I mentioned previously, we see room for improvement going forward. Our new guidance assumes a full year tax rate of approximately 31% and diluted shares outstanding of between 287 million and 289 million for the year. As usual, our guidance does not assume any capital deployment. Finally, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect sales of between $790 million and $805 million. This includes blood screening sales of between $5 million and $10 million, as well as Cynosure results of between $110 million and $115 million. We expect earnings per share of $0.48 to $0.50 in the third quarter, which includes a small benefit from Cynosure and minimal impact from blood screening. As you update your forecasts, we would again encourage you to model around the midpoint of our guidance ranges. We have incorporated both upsides and downsides into our forecast. There is uncertainty around the remaining blood screening revenues. And obviously, the Cynosure business is new for us. So before opening up the call for questions, I'd like to reiterate a point made by Steve earlier. Our second quarter was another good one in terms of financial results and a great quarter from a strategic perspective. In our core business, molecular diagnostics and Surgical continue to drive growth, while our international business is contributing progressively more as well. We're seeing the pipeline of organic innovation continuing to expand, and we've set the stage for the next chapter in our sustainable growth story by divesting the blood screening business and acquiring Cynosure. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Hey, Isaac. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, guys. I wanted to start with Breast Health. Obviously, you mentioned the double-digit growth outside the U.S. Can you talk a little bit more about what's going on in the U.S. market? Obviously, it's a little bit more mature there in terms of penetration for Tomo and there's, I think, a little bit of a new backdrop here politically. Trying to figure out if this new policy change, if that'll impact hospital capital spending. So, anything that you could tease out in terms of how the quarter went in the Breast Health equipment side, and then just sort of your expectation for the rest of the year in the U.S. That would be a great start. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure. Great, Isaac. And by the way, just to make sure that we didn't mix up things, the international Breast Health business grew at about mid single-digit rate. The overall international business grew at double-digit. So, I just want to make sure and clarify that. I think in the U.S., I think the simplest way to think about what we're seeing in the U.S. at this point is we've largely gotten all the big hospitals and the big institutions. And so where in the past, the orders, we're getting 5 gantries, 8 gantries, 6 gantries, 10 gantries, we're now kind of moving into that second half, but we're about halfway through our customer base where we're moving out into the community hospitals and it's much more onesies and twosies. And probably, candidly, among audiences and customers that are a little more price, sensitive, that might have gotten in later in the curve last time. And they may be slightly more spooked, I would say, just ever so gently, around what is the moving state of healthcare reform. So, I think in our key big hospitals, everything else, I think we're not seeing any real changes in capital. I think with some of the smaller hospitals, they're probably just being a little more cautious. So, I'd say nothing that we're overly concerned about by any stretch, but I do think we're kind of at that point in the curve where it's getting a little slower and a little harder to keep going and getting much more. So, I think it's why that business, as we've signaled really for quite some time, moving into a lower growth mindset, which is why we are very encouraged with the uptake outside the U.S. And at the end of the day, we're still less than 50% penetrated. So, we still have years' worth of gantries to convert over, it's just going to be in probably smaller orders. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. It's helpful color. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. You guys had a pretty solid revenue beat, but I think I mis-modeled gross margin here. It was a little bit lower than I expected. So, could you talk a little bit about what went on with the gross margin? Obviously, you have some different mix now with Cynosure in the folds, but wondering if there was maybe a pricing dynamic or something else in there on the gross margin that would explain the result. Thanks. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. Yes. Hey, Isaac. This is Bob. Yes, to be clear, there really was no pricing impact that impacted our gross margin at all. In fact, we feel very good about our pricing across all of the divisions. It really is a combination of the blood screening divestiture, and actually the over-performance of the blood screening was actually at a fairly low margin, as we have talked about as part of the contractual commitment. So, that impacted us negatively. We did have some effects in there, a little greater than what we had expected, and then there is some product mix issues as well, but nothing materially different than what we had expected. Operator Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hey, guys. This is Mike Sarcone on for Dan Leonard. Thanks for taking my question. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure, Mike. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. First one, on the mid single-digit full year guidance for the core business. Do you think you could parse out what you're looking for in terms of segment? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. Yes. I don't think we're going to get into that level of detail. I mean, I think, we have  we kind of identified that early on. I think our performance on our molecular business has exceeded our expectations to date, and we expect that to continue to be very strong. Our Surgical business, as we had talked about, had a stronger performance in the first half of the year than the second half of the year, but we're not going to get into giving segment guidance. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Thanks for the color there anyway. And just on the Cynosure integration, do you think you can elaborate on what you're doing to kind of unlock potential revenue synergies there? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure. I think, simply put, it's a  first off, getting their sales team back to 100%, and then we are increasingly working with our surgical sales team, and they're going to be working actually as lead generators, particularly the first program we're working on is lead generation for MonaLisa Touch because we believe our OB/GYN sales force has a tremendous number of customers that should be very good customers for MonaLisa Touch. So, I think that will be one of the very first areas. The other piece is I can tell you we're going to inject a little more into the direct-to-patient marketing and generally the marketing area. So, I think the way we look at it overall is they've got unbelievable products and we can probably help on a little bit of the sales generation lead and help on the marketing fronts. I think the other piece that I think we're starting to see is our strong relationships, not only with customers but with the professional organizations, is giving them new access that Cynosure on its own didn't have. And while that  it's hard to model in a spreadsheet, that does provide us with optionality going forward, and I think that gives us doors that are opening that weren't otherwise opened as a standalone organization for Cynosure. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. Yes. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Jack. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. I wanted to start with a two-part around molecular. You talked about driving testing compliance here in the U.S. So, how was growth for trich relative to HPV and CT/NG? And then as you looked at international, do you think you're starting to take some share with viral load? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. I think  we don't want to get into too much specific detail down to the specific assays, but I think overall what we're seeing is we're getting more docs to order a fuller menu of tests. They can be complementary while they're in there in the U.S., and I think that's what's really helping us drive growth from already very strong market shares. International, I think the virals are helping, but I frankly wouldn't overplay that. I think it's more driven by we're really getting Panther's placed and if you recall, we put a new leader in of our diagnostic sales organization in Europe back in the summer of 2015 and he spent a lot of the back half of 2015 and really into early 2016 rebuilding the team there, and I think that team has really started to hit its stride on both the women's health assays and virals as well. But I think it's more a Panther-driven story than truly a viral load-driven story at this point. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. Yes. I would agree, Steve, and maybe provide a little more color commentary on the U.S. If you look across all of the three main assays, we believe that we gained share in the quarter, very robust shares already. So, very strong growth not only in trich, but HPV and CTGC as well. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Great. And thanks for all the details on Cynosure too. I was hoping you could elaborate just a little bit on the sales force disruption in the quarter with the deal. Just what is the guidance to assume in terms of a ramp-up in productivity over the next couple of quarters? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure. In simple terms, like, I think the best way is to paint a picture for you and you guys know it's to be as straightforward as you can be. You recall there was a leak that they were being potentially shopped. They then had their national sales meeting, probably at the worst time humanly possible, which was about two weeks after that leak, and Mike Davin, who has been the incredible leader and continued with us. Mike was  been with that business for 13 years, 14 years. He couldn't even go to the sales meeting because of the process. So, he had to Skype into the sales meeting. So, you put a sales organization together in a room, their long-time leader is not there and he's answering questions on Skype, but by the way, he couldn't even really be as honest with them because, as we all know, in that time period you can't discuss. And I think the sales team sensed that, and we lost some good people in that realm. So, there were a few people that were, I think, on the fence, and lost them. We're completely rebuilding those. It reminded me, we've lost a ton of people right before we came to Hologic, and obviously Mike's built a good commercial team over time. We know how to do that. Having said that, the other piece I would tell you is it delayed some people that offers were out to. Who is going to join a company when you don't know exactly where it stands. So, there were some territories that were open for a while. They've now all been filled, but I think we're not yet necessarily assuming they're going to be back to 100% strength this quarter. I think, by the time we enter our fiscal 2018, we ought to be in great shape, but the next quarter or two it will be nothing like it was last quarter. We'll be making incremental progress this quarter as the guidance implies, and then I think a better quarter from there, and six months from now, I think, completely behind us. Operator Thank you. We'll hear next from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Hey, Raj. Operator Sir, please check your mute function. We are unable to hear you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Raj, are you with us? Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC Yes. Sorry, had it on mute, apologies. I wanted to follow a bit on the breast imaging business in the United States. I'm curious, is there anything you can offer in terms of how it is competitively out there? We've seen Fuji come into the market, but conversely we've also seen reimbursement expansion. So, maybe just some more detail on the complexion of market at this point. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure, Raj. I think probably the best way to describe the quarter, and you could see a little bit from the MQSA stuff, while the competitors were out there, they probably had, we would say, more of a slight delaying tactic in any time you have new competitors enter. It gives a hospital that might be on the verge of purchasing a reason to kind of delay and take a peek, and we basically had Fuji, as you well know. The other piece is GE launched their new product called Pristina, which is yet another version of 3D that is still no better than their 2D. And at the end of the day, we don't see having a huge impact, but it may have pushed a few things out. We're still best-in-class. We're holding our pricing. We have seen our competitors being very aggressive on pricing. And frankly, we could probably move a few more gantries if we went down, but we've worked really hard over the last three plus years to maintain pricing discipline which, when you have the best-in-class product, we want to do. So, I think that combined with growing insurance coverage, we continue to feel very good about where the market will go over time, but I think the big  the huge ramp-ups, I think, are behind us. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. And I think, Steve, to add to that, I mean in terms of share of new placements of Tomo, we are actually still gaining more than our share of the installed base. And with that, actually our ASPs are up slightly year-over-year. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. So, I think the team has done a fantastic job of continuing to roll out the adoption of our 3D, talking to the clinical and technical narrative and value of that, and I think it shows in the market, in the competitive position that we have. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC That's helpful. Maybe just for my follow-up, staying on 3D. When you think about where we are from a penetration standpoint, still maybe less than 30% of gantries have converted, near as we can tell. As you look out into the future in terms of the events that might  sort of a catalyst perhaps for faster adoption when we've already seen significant publications, and you mentioned 75% of women are now covered from a reimbursement standpoint, is there anything we can look to that could perhaps accelerate this market or the adoption at this point? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Nothing that we dramatically see. To be honest, I think the  you think about back to the 2D curve when the DMIST study came out, that really popped it. That came out earlier in the lifecycle. I think, at this point, we've already had the JAMA study. But I think we feel very good about much more steady progress as the covered lives continue to come on as more and more consumers become aware of the 3D. I think we just feel really good about the steady cadence. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. Yes. And I think, to build on that, Steve, to your point, we've been shipping in that 300-ish range really since the third quarter of fiscal 2015. And what I would encourage folks to think about is really an evolving story of our Breast Health business. As that installed base continues to grow, our service business is actually becoming a big growth driver there. And so, over the last two, three, four quarters, that business has been over $100 million. This last quarter, it grew double digits, really as that installed base continues to grow. And then we have the new products, the Affirm prone biopsy system. Our interventional business, albeit a small part of the business, also performed well in the quarter. And so, I think it is an important component, but not the only component of our Breast Health business. Operator Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey, thanks. Steve, sorry to harp on Cynosure, but can you... Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Hey, no problem. We love it, Tycho. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Can you help us get comfortable with what's implied about $40 million sequential step-up at the high end of that $110 million to $150 million guidance for 3Q? And can you quantify the magnitude of the sales force churn? It just seems like you were $30 million light relative to consensus on sign-up for the quarter end. How many reps, I guess, turned over? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. We're not going to get into the exact numbers on the sales force turnover. It was reasonably significant. Nothing that we hadn't seen with, frankly, the quarter or two before I arrived in Hologic. And overall, I think we feel very good about the underlying trend. The sales force is very much settled down. And obviously, as we look to the guidance for this quarter, we've  it's a very different number than what they had last quarter. And I think we feel very good about our ability to be back on track. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. I think the other thing, Tycho, is there is some seasonality in the business that the  our fiscal second quarter is typically one of the lighter ones for Cynosure. And the third quarter, the fiscal third quarter, is typically strongest. Their strongest is the calendar fourth quarter, which is now our fiscal first quarter. But you do see some natural ramp-up in the third quarter relative to the second quarter as well. So, they're not all equally distributed. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. And I'd tell you, Tycho, we feel better about the mid and longer-term projection for this business today than the day we bought it. But that's short-term disruption, and it's easily the stuff we know how to deal with. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then just to follow up on NovaSure. With the ADVANCED out there, should we think about that starting to grow again? Obviously, you've anniversaried the ThermaChoice dynamics, but how significant could ADVANCED be in terms of getting that back on a growth trajectory? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yeah. That business is going against such incredible comps. As you know, we're going against nine straight quarters of double-digit growth for the overall Surgical business. NovaSure itself came up. I would assume it's going to be flattish to slight growth at this point, and we'll actually be shooting for better than that. But as things have settled down, I think hopefully the NovaSure ADVANCED will get it re-growing, but I think pretty modest growth at this point. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. And I think, as we think about our Surgical business, the MyoSure product line continues to exceed our expectations. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. It continues to grow at very strong double-digit growth. And it's becoming almost as big as our NovaSure business on a global basis. So, that's something to consider as well as we think about the overall Surgical business. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Especially when you look at our mix overall, three years ago today, just of our businesses, molecular quietly has snuck up to become really our single largest product franchise. MyoSure has gone from this little brand to a real major contributor. And by definition, our Surgical business has become a much bigger contributor. So, you've got a lot of these mixes here that continue to shift, and I think just keep making us stronger. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Maybe first one, Steve, for you on Cyno. You already mentioned a solid pipeline of Cynosure products. They used to also speak to sort of skin tightening and a flagship that would feed up for 2018. I'm just curious if maybe we can get some thoughts from you on those and are those two products still tracking for commercialization in calendar year 2018. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes, Jon. There's some very good work and additional things that we didn't highlight here today that make us feel really good, and skin tightening being one of those. We want to get our full hands around the complete timing of those, but everything is looking good there. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Maybe just a quick follow-up. I'll actually ask a molecular question because it's a big healthy beat, at least relative to our estimates. You mentioned that the Panther placements driving the numbers over there. You also have the full complement of virals. Can we think about that international continuing? I know it's a law of larger numbers, but continuing to shake out in around that 20% range, helping to drive the overall worldwide into the low double-digits that we saw you guys put up this quarter. Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure. Thanks, Jon. I think I'm always leery to be forecasting 20% on top of 20%. Having said that, I think, do we think our international molecular business can at least be a double-digit grower for quite some time. And by the way, we still feel pretty good about the U.S. I don't think we're ready to declare our global molecular business to be a double-digit grower. But I think we feel really good that it's certainly accretive. It's becoming our largest product franchise and it's accretive to our total growth rate. So, we'll see with a few more quarters shaking out, but I think we continue to feel very good about where that is going. Operator Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Hey, Bill. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hi. So, a couple of questions. One, going back to O-U.S. molecular, if memory serves, you guys are kind of on the cusp of launching the Fusion sidecar and some assays there. So, Steve, could you talk about if, I guess, the anticipation of that helped out with Panther placements or is this some potential growth on the come? And then I've got a follow-up to that. Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure. I think the real driver internationally has just been Panther in the existing assays, more than the hoping of the Fusion. I think Fusion will be a very nice addition on top of it. I have a few customers. It certainly helps, as we are selling in Panther, for them to understand where we are going overall as a company and it's probably helped a little, but I don't think it's had a huge impact. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. And then on Cynosure and specifically with the surgical training and MonaLisa Touch, is this something that is happening this quarter or is this kind of in the next six months? And then maybe if you could talk a little bit about some of the other cross-selling opportunities, not so much opportunities, but rather timelines as we look out call it a year or so from now. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure, Bill. I think the very initial piece with the MonaLisa Touch, we're just in the early innings of having put together the plans for that and really just going to be rolling out to the sales force in the coming weeks. So, I think that's less going to have an impact say this quarter; probably start to have a modest impact next year. But I think will really be a very nice addition as we go into 2018. And as we remind everybody, we didn't buy Cynosure for 2017, felt really good about our core business and where we're going. We very much bought it for the next decade, and I think that's where we're being thoughtful as we're putting together these programs, even as we  it's as simple as we want to get our GYN/SURG reps to refer their physicians over, but we also want to make sure they don't take their eye off their ball and forget about NovaSure and MyoSure. So we've spent some time with the two selling organizations, coming up with the right incentive scheme so we don't do the old pendulum swing from one to the other. And then I think, assuming good success with MonaLisa Touch on the referrals, there is going to clearly be other opportunities to do more there with other products, I would think. Operator Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Hey, Vijay. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC Steve? Hi, Steve. So, maybe one on Cynosure. I just  I apologize if you already explained this. And it looks like  so, because of the disruption, sales were down 19%, right, when I'm looking on year-on-year basis. I just want to understand maybe, Steve, what were the month-on-month trends like Jan, Feb and March? Looks like most of the disruptions happened in March, and I'm assuming the guidance for the June ending quarter assumed some disruption in May. I just want to understand, is that how we should be thinking about the Cyno numbers? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. First off, we're not going to get into month-on-month, Vijay, as you can probably appreciate. We may start to go weekly data. But I think here is the simple piece. Once the deal closed on March 22, we're able to start to get in there, and I'd say morale is in a very different place early May than it was early March. So, we're in a very different place. They really lost people in late  lost a number of reps, frankly, in late January, early February, and then we've been replacing those and rebuilding. So, again, I think we feel it's very unfortunate, but I wouldn't at all expect that to be a trend. We very much think of it as a blip. And as evidenced by our guidance already for what we have for this quarter, next quarter, we feel like we'll be back on track. We won't be knocking the cover off the ball the way we would like to, say, this quarter, but I think another quarter or two we're absolutely going to be there. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC That's very helpful, Steve. And maybe one for Bob on the guidance. What is the organic revenue guidance for the base business, excluding Cynosure, Bob, in the upgraded guidance? I think the prior one was minus 70 bps to plus 70 bps. I'm just wondering, is there an apples to apples compare? I know you guys beat the quarter by $0.04 on the EPS, but it was raised by $0.08 for the year. So, are there other moving parts on EPS line that we should be thinking about? Thank you. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. Yes. I guess, on the core business, Vijay, the way to think about the base business is still that mid single-digit growth rate on the revenue side and low single-digit growth on the EPS side, with that $0.48 to $0.50. There's really no contribution of blood in Q3 from an EPS perspective, and a minor contribution from Cynosure. So, that's the way you should think about it. Operator Thank you. We'll now take our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Good afternoon. Steve, two questions for you. How are you? So, there's a lot of focus in this call about the M&A disruption because of the Cynosure process. I guess, how confident are you that the rep disruption is not the impact of Allergan, ZELTIQ, which may have froze the customer channel and froze rep hiring? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. There is certainly an element of that, David, I think. But I think, now with them closed, us closed, it's back to stuff we know really well, which is building great sales teams around great products. So, I think there was certainly  there was a lot of chatter and noise and it's  that's what I want to say, and you get it. That clearly had an impact on sales psyche. That's now all behind us, and we feel very good about our abilities to go forward. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Just two more quick ones. The other things you announced in this call, there's a six-month delay in the submental approval and, as you know, ZELTIQ has that label. So, was that at all a factor in guidance? We were expecting that back half 2017, it's now first half 2018. And then second question, on MonaLisa. How important is it strategically to own the asset versus relying on the distributorship? Thanks very much. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. First one, I don't think the submental is a significant change. It maybe has been communicated, but I think we're very hopeful that that program would be on, I think as we said, later this year. I think we did say our beginning of fiscal 2018, remember that is the end of calendar 2017 for us. So, we're feeling pretty good about where that's going. And on the MonaLisa, owning would be nice, but I think we feel very good about the overall relationship there and the contractual state that we're in with El.En. Operator Thank you. We'll now... Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Operator, I think we might have time for one or two more questions. Operator Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. No shock on the topic. So, with Cynosure, we see miss in the quarter. Are those revenues that are actually lost? Are those revenues that you were in negotiations with people and then the sales reps to kind of close and you will see later in the year? Can you just talk about if you've lost things to competitors or it's just more of a delay? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes, I think we lost them to competitors, Brian. I think it's  we had a bunch of reps that weren't showing when you have reps leave and you're in a very customer and sales intensive business, but many of those sales will still be there. It will be later in the year. Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. And then, on the distribution, you made an acquisition named Medicor. Can you talked about any financial impact from that? Is it likely that we'll see others there and why did you start with that one? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure. The impact is fairly de minimis in terms of overall revenue and profits, but strategically it's going to give us a very nice shot in the arm. And I think one of the reasons we started there, they were our single biggest distributor in Europe. So, we like them and we were able to do a deal there. They were largely a Hologic dealer. Some of our other countries, we deal with dealers where we may be a minority part of their business, and a lot of complexity. So, we would hope to be able to do more in the years ahead, but they were clearly the one probably we coveted the most. And I think they have a direct presence, particularly in Germany. It's a really nice place to be. Operator Thank you. We'll now take our final question from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. My first question is on Cyno. I think consensus estimates were calling for 12% and 10% growth year-over-year in calendar 2017 and 2018, respectively. Understanding that there was a bit of a blip in this present quarter, how should we think about any changes to the double-digit growth rate trajectory of that business? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. We think that's going to be the ongoing growth rate. We feel great about that business. It's just going to take us probably a couple of quarters to get back to it. I think about it this way. When you look at where our Surgical business was a few years ago, nobody ever would have guessed we could generate nine straight quarters of double-digit growth. I think, our prospects, as we look at the Cynosure business and the underlying market and the products we have, I think, we feel great about our ability to generate great growth. This was just  it was an unusual year when you have a small company that's very dependent on its leader and its leader is very distracted in a quarter, and it's publicly being all the rumors out there that they're being taken over and this and that. It was a goofy period, but it's totally a blip. It's not an ongoing thing. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Great. And this is a two-parter. What percentage of revenue came from the non-core channel? And then following that, we did a survey, nearly 60% of physicians in the non-core channel indicated that they may adopt non-invasive aesthetics over time. So, can you just speak to the market size and what you're thinking about the long-term market opportunity from non-core physicians? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. We're not going to break out what percentage of revenue came from non-cores, but we continue to believe non-cores are a huge, huge opportunity. That's what  when Mike Davin and I first sat down and talked, actually last year, that was so evident to me as to where they were thinking about going with so much of the non-core business. And you think about  and you saw it, I think, in your research between both OB/GYNs as well as, frankly, even broader GPs, people starting to look for additional ways to make money and take care of women and women's health. We think that there is so much opportunity. It's why we're probably more excited today. To a minor blip in the quarter, big deal, we're going to be past that. We just love the fundamentals of the market, the under-penetration of the docs, and we see great interest from a number of the non-cores going forward. Operator Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes the Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.

And we'll take our first question from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Hey, Isaac. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, guys. I wanted to start with Breast Health. Obviously, you mentioned the double-digit growth outside the U.S. Can you talk a little bit more about what's going on in the U.S. market? Obviously, it's a little bit more mature there in terms of penetration for Tomo and there's, I think, a little bit of a new backdrop here politically. Trying to figure out if this new policy change, if that'll impact hospital capital spending. So, anything that you could tease out in terms of how the quarter went in the Breast Health equipment side, and then just sort of your expectation for the rest of the year in the U.S. That would be a great start. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure. Great, Isaac. And by the way, just to make sure that we didn't mix up things, the international Breast Health business grew at about mid single-digit rate. The overall international business grew at double-digit. So, I just want to make sure and clarify that. I think in the U.S., I think the simplest way to think about what we're seeing in the U.S. at this point is we've largely gotten all the big hospitals and the big institutions. And so where in the past, the orders, we're getting 5 gantries, 8 gantries, 6 gantries, 10 gantries, we're now kind of moving into that second half, but we're about halfway through our customer base where we're moving out into the community hospitals and it's much more onesies and twosies. And probably, candidly, among audiences and customers that are a little more price, sensitive, that might have gotten in later in the curve last time. And they may be slightly more spooked, I would say, just ever so gently, around what is the moving state of healthcare reform. So, I think in our key big hospitals, everything else, I think we're not seeing any real changes in capital. I think with some of the smaller hospitals, they're probably just being a little more cautious. So, I'd say nothing that we're overly concerned about by any stretch, but I do think we're kind of at that point in the curve where it's getting a little slower and a little harder to keep going and getting much more. So, I think it's why that business, as we've signaled really for quite some time, moving into a lower growth mindset, which is why we are very encouraged with the uptake outside the U.S. And at the end of the day, we're still less than 50% penetrated. So, we still have years' worth of gantries to convert over, it's just going to be in probably smaller orders. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. It's helpful color. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. You guys had a pretty solid revenue beat, but I think I mis-modeled gross margin here. It was a little bit lower than I expected. So, could you talk a little bit about what went on with the gross margin? Obviously, you have some different mix now with Cynosure in the folds, but wondering if there was maybe a pricing dynamic or something else in there on the gross margin that would explain the result. Thanks. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. Yes. Hey, Isaac. This is Bob. Yes, to be clear, there really was no pricing impact that impacted our gross margin at all. In fact, we feel very good about our pricing across all of the divisions. It really is a combination of the blood screening divestiture, and actually the over-performance of the blood screening was actually at a fairly low margin, as we have talked about as part of the contractual commitment. So, that impacted us negatively. We did have some effects in there, a little greater than what we had expected, and then there is some product mix issues as well, but nothing materially different than what we had expected. Operator Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hey, guys. This is Mike Sarcone on for Dan Leonard. Thanks for taking my question. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure, Mike. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. First one, on the mid single-digit full year guidance for the core business. Do you think you could parse out what you're looking for in terms of segment? Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. Yes. I don't think we're going to get into that level of detail. I mean, I think, we have  we kind of identified that early on. I think our performance on our molecular business has exceeded our expectations to date, and we expect that to continue to be very strong. Our Surgical business, as we had talked about, had a stronger performance in the first half of the year than the second half of the year, but we're not going to get into giving segment guidance. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Thanks for the color there anyway. And just on the Cynosure integration, do you think you can elaborate on what you're doing to kind of unlock potential revenue synergies there? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure. I think, simply put, it's a  first off, getting their sales team back to 100%, and then we are increasingly working with our surgical sales team, and they're going to be working actually as lead generators, particularly the first program we're working on is lead generation for MonaLisa Touch because we believe our OB/GYN sales force has a tremendous number of customers that should be very good customers for MonaLisa Touch. So, I think that will be one of the very first areas. The other piece is I can tell you we're going to inject a little more into the direct-to-patient marketing and generally the marketing area. So, I think the way we look at it overall is they've got unbelievable products and we can probably help on a little bit of the sales generation lead and help on the marketing fronts. I think the other piece that I think we're starting to see is our strong relationships, not only with customers but with the professional organizations, is giving them new access that Cynosure on its own didn't have. And while that  it's hard to model in a spreadsheet, that does provide us with optionality going forward, and I think that gives us doors that are opening that weren't otherwise opened as a standalone organization for Cynosure. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. Yes. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Jack. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. I wanted to start with a two-part around molecular. You talked about driving testing compliance here in the U.S. So, how was growth for trich relative to HPV and CT/NG? And then as you looked at international, do you think you're starting to take some share with viral load? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. I think  we don't want to get into too much specific detail down to the specific assays, but I think overall what we're seeing is we're getting more docs to order a fuller menu of tests. They can be complementary while they're in there in the U.S., and I think that's what's really helping us drive growth from already very strong market shares. International, I think the virals are helping, but I frankly wouldn't overplay that. I think it's more driven by we're really getting Panther's placed and if you recall, we put a new leader in of our diagnostic sales organization in Europe back in the summer of 2015 and he spent a lot of the back half of 2015 and really into early 2016 rebuilding the team there, and I think that team has really started to hit its stride on both the women's health assays and virals as well. But I think it's more a Panther-driven story than truly a viral load-driven story at this point. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. Yes. I would agree, Steve, and maybe provide a little more color commentary on the U.S. If you look across all of the three main assays, we believe that we gained share in the quarter, very robust shares already. So, very strong growth not only in trich, but HPV and CTGC as well. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Great. And thanks for all the details on Cynosure too. I was hoping you could elaborate just a little bit on the sales force disruption in the quarter with the deal. Just what is the guidance to assume in terms of a ramp-up in productivity over the next couple of quarters? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure. In simple terms, like, I think the best way is to paint a picture for you and you guys know it's to be as straightforward as you can be. You recall there was a leak that they were being potentially shopped. They then had their national sales meeting, probably at the worst time humanly possible, which was about two weeks after that leak, and Mike Davin, who has been the incredible leader and continued with us. Mike was  been with that business for 13 years, 14 years. He couldn't even go to the sales meeting because of the process. So, he had to Skype into the sales meeting. So, you put a sales organization together in a room, their long-time leader is not there and he's answering questions on Skype, but by the way, he couldn't even really be as honest with them because, as we all know, in that time period you can't discuss. And I think the sales team sensed that, and we lost some good people in that realm. So, there were a few people that were, I think, on the fence, and lost them. We're completely rebuilding those. It reminded me, we've lost a ton of people right before we came to Hologic, and obviously Mike's built a good commercial team over time. We know how to do that. Having said that, the other piece I would tell you is it delayed some people that offers were out to. Who is going to join a company when you don't know exactly where it stands. So, there were some territories that were open for a while. They've now all been filled, but I think we're not yet necessarily assuming they're going to be back to 100% strength this quarter. I think, by the time we enter our fiscal 2018, we ought to be in great shape, but the next quarter or two it will be nothing like it was last quarter. We'll be making incremental progress this quarter as the guidance implies, and then I think a better quarter from there, and six months from now, I think, completely behind us. Operator Thank you. We'll hear next from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Hey, Raj. Operator Sir, please check your mute function. We are unable to hear you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Raj, are you with us? Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC Yes. Sorry, had it on mute, apologies. I wanted to follow a bit on the breast imaging business in the United States. I'm curious, is there anything you can offer in terms of how it is competitively out there? We've seen Fuji come into the market, but conversely we've also seen reimbursement expansion. So, maybe just some more detail on the complexion of market at this point. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure, Raj. I think probably the best way to describe the quarter, and you could see a little bit from the MQSA stuff, while the competitors were out there, they probably had, we would say, more of a slight delaying tactic in any time you have new competitors enter. It gives a hospital that might be on the verge of purchasing a reason to kind of delay and take a peek, and we basically had Fuji, as you well know. The other piece is GE launched their new product called Pristina, which is yet another version of 3D that is still no better than their 2D. And at the end of the day, we don't see having a huge impact, but it may have pushed a few things out. We're still best-in-class. We're holding our pricing. We have seen our competitors being very aggressive on pricing. And frankly, we could probably move a few more gantries if we went down, but we've worked really hard over the last three plus years to maintain pricing discipline which, when you have the best-in-class product, we want to do. So, I think that combined with growing insurance coverage, we continue to feel very good about where the market will go over time, but I think the big  the huge ramp-ups, I think, are behind us. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. And I think, Steve, to add to that, I mean in terms of share of new placements of Tomo, we are actually still gaining more than our share of the installed base. And with that, actually our ASPs are up slightly year-over-year. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. So, I think the team has done a fantastic job of continuing to roll out the adoption of our 3D, talking to the clinical and technical narrative and value of that, and I think it shows in the market, in the competitive position that we have. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC That's helpful. Maybe just for my follow-up, staying on 3D. When you think about where we are from a penetration standpoint, still maybe less than 30% of gantries have converted, near as we can tell. As you look out into the future in terms of the events that might  sort of a catalyst perhaps for faster adoption when we've already seen significant publications, and you mentioned 75% of women are now covered from a reimbursement standpoint, is there anything we can look to that could perhaps accelerate this market or the adoption at this point? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Nothing that we dramatically see. To be honest, I think the  you think about back to the 2D curve when the DMIST study came out, that really popped it. That came out earlier in the lifecycle. I think, at this point, we've already had the JAMA study. But I think we feel very good about much more steady progress as the covered lives continue to come on as more and more consumers become aware of the 3D. I think we just feel really good about the steady cadence. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. Yes. And I think, to build on that, Steve, to your point, we've been shipping in that 300-ish range really since the third quarter of fiscal 2015. And what I would encourage folks to think about is really an evolving story of our Breast Health business. As that installed base continues to grow, our service business is actually becoming a big growth driver there. And so, over the last two, three, four quarters, that business has been over $100 million. This last quarter, it grew double digits, really as that installed base continues to grow. And then we have the new products, the Affirm prone biopsy system. Our interventional business, albeit a small part of the business, also performed well in the quarter. And so, I think it is an important component, but not the only component of our Breast Health business. Operator Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey, thanks. Steve, sorry to harp on Cynosure, but can you... Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Hey, no problem. We love it, Tycho. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Can you help us get comfortable with what's implied about $40 million sequential step-up at the high end of that $110 million to $150 million guidance for 3Q? And can you quantify the magnitude of the sales force churn? It just seems like you were $30 million light relative to consensus on sign-up for the quarter end. How many reps, I guess, turned over? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. We're not going to get into the exact numbers on the sales force turnover. It was reasonably significant. Nothing that we hadn't seen with, frankly, the quarter or two before I arrived in Hologic. And overall, I think we feel very good about the underlying trend. The sales force is very much settled down. And obviously, as we look to the guidance for this quarter, we've  it's a very different number than what they had last quarter. And I think we feel very good about our ability to be back on track. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. I think the other thing, Tycho, is there is some seasonality in the business that the  our fiscal second quarter is typically one of the lighter ones for Cynosure. And the third quarter, the fiscal third quarter, is typically strongest. Their strongest is the calendar fourth quarter, which is now our fiscal first quarter. But you do see some natural ramp-up in the third quarter relative to the second quarter as well. So, they're not all equally distributed. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. And I'd tell you, Tycho, we feel better about the mid and longer-term projection for this business today than the day we bought it. But that's short-term disruption, and it's easily the stuff we know how to deal with. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then just to follow up on NovaSure. With the ADVANCED out there, should we think about that starting to grow again? Obviously, you've anniversaried the ThermaChoice dynamics, but how significant could ADVANCED be in terms of getting that back on a growth trajectory? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yeah. That business is going against such incredible comps. As you know, we're going against nine straight quarters of double-digit growth for the overall Surgical business. NovaSure itself came up. I would assume it's going to be flattish to slight growth at this point, and we'll actually be shooting for better than that. But as things have settled down, I think hopefully the NovaSure ADVANCED will get it re-growing, but I think pretty modest growth at this point. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. And I think, as we think about our Surgical business, the MyoSure product line continues to exceed our expectations. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. It continues to grow at very strong double-digit growth. And it's becoming almost as big as our NovaSure business on a global basis. So, that's something to consider as well as we think about the overall Surgical business. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Especially when you look at our mix overall, three years ago today, just of our businesses, molecular quietly has snuck up to become really our single largest product franchise. MyoSure has gone from this little brand to a real major contributor. And by definition, our Surgical business has become a much bigger contributor. So, you've got a lot of these mixes here that continue to shift, and I think just keep making us stronger. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Maybe first one, Steve, for you on Cyno. You already mentioned a solid pipeline of Cynosure products. They used to also speak to sort of skin tightening and a flagship that would feed up for 2018. I'm just curious if maybe we can get some thoughts from you on those and are those two products still tracking for commercialization in calendar year 2018. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes, Jon. There's some very good work and additional things that we didn't highlight here today that make us feel really good, and skin tightening being one of those. We want to get our full hands around the complete timing of those, but everything is looking good there. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Maybe just a quick follow-up. I'll actually ask a molecular question because it's a big healthy beat, at least relative to our estimates. You mentioned that the Panther placements driving the numbers over there. You also have the full complement of virals. Can we think about that international continuing? I know it's a law of larger numbers, but continuing to shake out in around that 20% range, helping to drive the overall worldwide into the low double-digits that we saw you guys put up this quarter. Thank you. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure. Thanks, Jon. I think I'm always leery to be forecasting 20% on top of 20%. Having said that, I think, do we think our international molecular business can at least be a double-digit grower for quite some time. And by the way, we still feel pretty good about the U.S. I don't think we're ready to declare our global molecular business to be a double-digit grower. But I think we feel really good that it's certainly accretive. It's becoming our largest product franchise and it's accretive to our total growth rate. So, we'll see with a few more quarters shaking out, but I think we continue to feel very good about where that is going. Operator Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Hey, Bill. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hi. So, a couple of questions. One, going back to O-U.S. molecular, if memory serves, you guys are kind of on the cusp of launching the Fusion sidecar and some assays there. So, Steve, could you talk about if, I guess, the anticipation of that helped out with Panther placements or is this some potential growth on the come? And then I've got a follow-up to that. Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure. I think the real driver internationally has just been Panther in the existing assays, more than the hoping of the Fusion. I think Fusion will be a very nice addition on top of it. I have a few customers. It certainly helps, as we are selling in Panther, for them to understand where we are going overall as a company and it's probably helped a little, but I don't think it's had a huge impact. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. And then on Cynosure and specifically with the surgical training and MonaLisa Touch, is this something that is happening this quarter or is this kind of in the next six months? And then maybe if you could talk a little bit about some of the other cross-selling opportunities, not so much opportunities, but rather timelines as we look out call it a year or so from now. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure, Bill. I think the very initial piece with the MonaLisa Touch, we're just in the early innings of having put together the plans for that and really just going to be rolling out to the sales force in the coming weeks. So, I think that's less going to have an impact say this quarter; probably start to have a modest impact next year. But I think will really be a very nice addition as we go into 2018. And as we remind everybody, we didn't buy Cynosure for 2017, felt really good about our core business and where we're going. We very much bought it for the next decade, and I think that's where we're being thoughtful as we're putting together these programs, even as we  it's as simple as we want to get our GYN/SURG reps to refer their physicians over, but we also want to make sure they don't take their eye off their ball and forget about NovaSure and MyoSure. So we've spent some time with the two selling organizations, coming up with the right incentive scheme so we don't do the old pendulum swing from one to the other. And then I think, assuming good success with MonaLisa Touch on the referrals, there is going to clearly be other opportunities to do more there with other products, I would think. Operator Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Hey, Vijay. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC Steve? Hi, Steve. So, maybe one on Cynosure. I just  I apologize if you already explained this. And it looks like  so, because of the disruption, sales were down 19%, right, when I'm looking on year-on-year basis. I just want to understand maybe, Steve, what were the month-on-month trends like Jan, Feb and March? Looks like most of the disruptions happened in March, and I'm assuming the guidance for the June ending quarter assumed some disruption in May. I just want to understand, is that how we should be thinking about the Cyno numbers? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. First off, we're not going to get into month-on-month, Vijay, as you can probably appreciate. We may start to go weekly data. But I think here is the simple piece. Once the deal closed on March 22, we're able to start to get in there, and I'd say morale is in a very different place early May than it was early March. So, we're in a very different place. They really lost people in late  lost a number of reps, frankly, in late January, early February, and then we've been replacing those and rebuilding. So, again, I think we feel it's very unfortunate, but I wouldn't at all expect that to be a trend. We very much think of it as a blip. And as evidenced by our guidance already for what we have for this quarter, next quarter, we feel like we'll be back on track. We won't be knocking the cover off the ball the way we would like to, say, this quarter, but I think another quarter or two we're absolutely going to be there. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC That's very helpful, Steve. And maybe one for Bob on the guidance. What is the organic revenue guidance for the base business, excluding Cynosure, Bob, in the upgraded guidance? I think the prior one was minus 70 bps to plus 70 bps. I'm just wondering, is there an apples to apples compare? I know you guys beat the quarter by $0.04 on the EPS, but it was raised by $0.08 for the year. So, are there other moving parts on EPS line that we should be thinking about? Thank you. Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc. Yes. I guess, on the core business, Vijay, the way to think about the base business is still that mid single-digit growth rate on the revenue side and low single-digit growth on the EPS side, with that $0.48 to $0.50. There's really no contribution of blood in Q3 from an EPS perspective, and a minor contribution from Cynosure. So, that's the way you should think about it. Operator Thank you. We'll now take our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Good afternoon. Steve, two questions for you. How are you? So, there's a lot of focus in this call about the M&A disruption because of the Cynosure process. I guess, how confident are you that the rep disruption is not the impact of Allergan, ZELTIQ, which may have froze the customer channel and froze rep hiring? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. There is certainly an element of that, David, I think. But I think, now with them closed, us closed, it's back to stuff we know really well, which is building great sales teams around great products. So, I think there was certainly  there was a lot of chatter and noise and it's  that's what I want to say, and you get it. That clearly had an impact on sales psyche. That's now all behind us, and we feel very good about our abilities to go forward. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Just two more quick ones. The other things you announced in this call, there's a six-month delay in the submental approval and, as you know, ZELTIQ has that label. So, was that at all a factor in guidance? We were expecting that back half 2017, it's now first half 2018. And then second question, on MonaLisa. How important is it strategically to own the asset versus relying on the distributorship? Thanks very much. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. First one, I don't think the submental is a significant change. It maybe has been communicated, but I think we're very hopeful that that program would be on, I think as we said, later this year. I think we did say our beginning of fiscal 2018, remember that is the end of calendar 2017 for us. So, we're feeling pretty good about where that's going. And on the MonaLisa, owning would be nice, but I think we feel very good about the overall relationship there and the contractual state that we're in with El.En. Operator Thank you. We'll now... Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Operator, I think we might have time for one or two more questions. Operator Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. No shock on the topic. So, with Cynosure, we see miss in the quarter. Are those revenues that are actually lost? Are those revenues that you were in negotiations with people and then the sales reps to kind of close and you will see later in the year? Can you just talk about if you've lost things to competitors or it's just more of a delay? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes, I think we lost them to competitors, Brian. I think it's  we had a bunch of reps that weren't showing when you have reps leave and you're in a very customer and sales intensive business, but many of those sales will still be there. It will be later in the year. Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. And then, on the distribution, you made an acquisition named Medicor. Can you talked about any financial impact from that? Is it likely that we'll see others there and why did you start with that one? Thanks. Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Sure. The impact is fairly de minimis in terms of overall revenue and profits, but strategically it's going to give us a very nice shot in the arm. And I think one of the reasons we started there, they were our single biggest distributor in Europe. So, we like them and we were able to do a deal there. They were largely a Hologic dealer. Some of our other countries, we deal with dealers where we may be a minority part of their business, and a lot of complexity. So, we would hope to be able to do more in the years ahead, but they were clearly the one probably we coveted the most. And I think they have a direct presence, particularly in Germany. It's a really nice place to be. Operator Thank you. We'll now take our final question from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. My first question is on Cyno. I think consensus estimates were calling for 12% and 10% growth year-over-year in calendar 2017 and 2018, respectively. Understanding that there was a bit of a blip in this present quarter, how should we think about any changes to the double-digit growth rate trajectory of that business? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. We think that's going to be the ongoing growth rate. We feel great about that business. It's just going to take us probably a couple of quarters to get back to it. I think about it this way. When you look at where our Surgical business was a few years ago, nobody ever would have guessed we could generate nine straight quarters of double-digit growth. I think, our prospects, as we look at the Cynosure business and the underlying market and the products we have, I think, we feel great about our ability to generate great growth. This was just  it was an unusual year when you have a small company that's very dependent on its leader and its leader is very distracted in a quarter, and it's publicly being all the rumors out there that they're being taken over and this and that. It was a goofy period, but it's totally a blip. It's not an ongoing thing. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Great. And this is a two-parter. What percentage of revenue came from the non-core channel? And then following that, we did a survey, nearly 60% of physicians in the non-core channel indicated that they may adopt non-invasive aesthetics over time. So, can you just speak to the market size and what you're thinking about the long-term market opportunity from non-core physicians? Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc. Yes. We're not going to break out what percentage of revenue came from non-cores, but we continue to believe non-cores are a huge, huge opportunity. That's what  when Mike Davin and I first sat down and talked, actually last year, that was so evident to me as to where they were thinking about going with so much of the non-core business. And you think about  and you saw it, I think, in your research between both OB/GYNs as well as, frankly, even broader GPs, people starting to look for additional ways to make money and take care of women and women's health. We think that there is so much opportunity. It's why we're probably more excited today. To a minor blip in the quarter, big deal, we're going to be past that. We just love the fundamentals of the market, the under-penetration of the docs, and we see great interest from a number of the non-cores going forward. Operator Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes the Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. Have a good evening.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Carolynne Borders, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Carolynne. Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc. Thank you, Dianna, and thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the first quarter of 2017.

I ask that during the Q&A portion, you limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up before returning to the queue, allowing as many listeners as possible to ask a question within the one hour that we have allotted for the call. With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman. Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. Thank you, Carolynne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are pleased to report record first quarter financial results. We believe the markets we serve are generally healthy and growing and that our Global Dental, Animal Health and Medical groups all continue to gain market share and that the trajectory will continue. We remain quite comfortable with our strategies with respect to gaining market share. On the bottom line, we delivered strong year-over-year diluted EPS growth for the quarter and are affirming guidance for 2017 diluted EPS. Given our customer focus and our diverse business model, we believe we are well positioned for long-term growth. While some markets will grow faster than others at a particular point in time, we believe we serve attractive end markets with solid opportunities for growth in the years to come as we continue to advance our value-added solutions to help our customers operate better practices, more efficient practices and at the same time provide quality in care. Our focus remains firmly on continued financial execution and in connection, value creation for our shareholders. In a moment, I'll provide some additional comments on our recent business performance and accomplishments, but first, let me turn to Steve who will review our financial results for the quarter. Thank you. Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc. Okay, thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. As we begin, I'd like to point out that there were no restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2017. However, our prior year first quarter results included restructuring costs of $4.1 million pre-tax or approximately $0.04 per diluted share. I will be discussing our results on an as-reported or GAAP basis as well as on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the prior year restructuring costs. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management in operating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. You can see Exhibit B on this morning's earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial data. So turning to our results, our net sales for the quarter ended April 1, 2017 were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 7.7% increase compared with the first quarter of 2016. This consisted of 8.7% growth in local currencies and a 1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 5.9% and acquisition growth was 2.8%. You could also see the details of our sales growth that are contained in Exhibit A of our earnings news release issued today. If you look at our operating margin for the first quarter of 2017, it was 6.6% and it expanded by 14 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2016. I'd like to provide some additional details with respect to our operating margin expansion for the quarter. First, it relates to the inclusion of restructuring costs in last year's first quarter of 2016. The restructuring costs in the prior year favorably impacted our operating margin comparison by 15 basis points. And the second item relates to acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and related expenses, as well as switches between agency and direct sales, which combined to negatively impact the expansion by 7 basis points. So if you were to exclude the net impact of these two items, our operating margin expanded by 6 basis points for the quarter. Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, and that compares to 30.5% in the first quarter of 2016. As we mentioned during our Q4 earnings conference call, we have implemented ASU 2016-09, which is a new accounting standard that requires excess tax benefits related to share appreciation of stock grants to be recognized as a reduction in income tax expense in the period in which the awards vest. As a result, our effective tax rate was favorably impacted in the first quarter as this is when most of our stock-based awards vest at Henry Schein. This standard will primarily impact Q1 each year and will have varying effects on our tax rate based on the share price and number of shares that vest. We previously provided guidance for Q1 2017 stating that that benefit would result in an effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 24%. However, the actual benefit was more favorable and our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%. As a result, we are revising our fiscal year effective tax rate guidance from somewhere in the 28% range down to the 27% range. Our net income attributable to Henry Schein was $140.7 million or $1.76 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 23.7% and 28.5%, respectively, and that's compared to the first quarter of 2016 GAAP results. The net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. and diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2017 increased 20.5% and 24.8%, respectively, when compared to the first quarter of 2016 non-GAAP results, which excludes the restructuring costs in the prior year. I'll note that foreign exchange negatively impacted our diluted EPS for the quarter by approximately $0.02 per share. We're also reaffirming our guidance on a full year basis, but expect Q2 diluted EPS growth to be in the mid-single digit range with growth accelerating in the second half of the year. I'll now provide some detail on our sales results for the quarter. Our Dental sales for the first quarter of 2017 increased 7.9% to $1.4 billion. Internally generated sales in local currencies were up 2.9%, acquisitions contributed an additional 5.3% and there was a 0.3% decrease related to foreign exchange. In North America, our internal sales growth in local currencies was 0.8% and included 2.5% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and a 5.5% decline in dental equipment sales and service revenue. For the past few quarters, our North American consumable merchandise growth rate was impacted by the decision to stop selling precious metals in last year's second quarter. This decision negatively impacted our North American dental consumable merchandise sales growth in Q1 by approximately 50 basis points. This impact has now annualized and will not affect our dental merchandise growth rate going forward. Without this impact, we estimate that the 2.5% growth rate to be approximately 3%. I think it's also important to note that consumable merchandise sales growth is somewhat favorably impacted by an easier comparable versus Q1 of last year. This is because the December 2015 holiday week was included in Q1 2016. That week is generally a slower week for consumable merchandise sales and a stronger week for equipment due to year-end tax incentives. The decline in North American dental equipment was primarily due to this difficult comparison as well as an acceleration of sales into the previous quarter related to the Section 179 tax incentive. The difficult calendar comparison will only occur in this Q1. And it's important to note that our current equipment backlog is strong and we anticipate at least mid-single digit growth in Q2 for our North American dental equipment sales. Our international dental internal growth in local currencies were 6.8%, included 8.0% growth in sales of dental consumable merchandise and 3.1% growth in dental equipment sales and service revenue. The international dental merchandise sales growth benefited from the same comparison that I just reviewed, as well as internationally an extra day in a number of European countries. This extra day is due to the timing of Good Friday, which is a holiday in many countries and that occurred in Q1 last year and this year will occur in Q2. On an overall basis, we believe we continue to outpace the global dental market in Q1, and we believe the fundamentals of our business strategy remain strong. Turning to Animal Health, our Animal Health sales were $812.9 million in the first quarter, an increase of 5.4%. Internally generated sales in local currencies were up 7.1%, acquisitions contributed an additional 1%, and there was a 2.7% decrease due to foreign exchange. The 7.1% internal growth in local currencies included 5.5% growth in North America and 8.9% growth internationally. If you look at the sales growth from certain products that switched between agency sales and direct sales in North America, that positively impacted our growth rate by approximately 80 basis points for the quarter. These results were solid and as we  and we believe we continue to gain market share on a global Animal Health. Turning to Medical, our Medical sales was $598.9 million in the first quarter, an increase of 11.3%. Sales growth in local currencies was 11.5%, all internally generated and 0.2% decrease due to foreign exchange. The 11.5% growth included 11.7% growth in North America and growth of 5.5% in local currencies internationally. We are pleased with our Medical growth, which was driven by sales increases with several IDNs that we started on-boarding in the middle of last year as well as strong organic growth from existing customers. We believe we continue to gain market share in our overall Medical business. Technology and Value-Added Services sales were $106.0 million in the quarter, an increase of 4.2%. Sales growth in local currencies was 5.5%, all internally generated and 1.3% decrease related to foreign exchange. The 5.5% growth included 3.4% growth in North America and 7.2% growth internationally. In North America, the 3.4% growth reflects some softness in financial services revenue and this is related to lower North American dental equipment sales and as people know, we have leasing revenues related to North American dental equipment, so it follows the overall equipment revenue cycle. In the international markets, sales of 17.2% were highlighted by strong software revenue in the U.K. and Australia, New Zealand. We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market for the first quarter. Specifically, we repurchased approximately 308,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $162.34 per share and that equated to approximately $50 million. This impact of the repurchase of our shares in the first quarter was not material to our EPS. At the close of the first quarter, Henry Schein had approximately $200 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. We believe we will continue to drive increased shareholder value with a smart capital allocation strategy, which is focused on deploying a large portion of our annual free cash flow to both share repurchases and M&A activities. If we look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter, our operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $52.6 million, but that is better than the negative $77.8 million in the prior year's first quarter. And as I think people know, our first quarter cash flow was typically negative due to seasonality of working capital during the quarter. For the year, we continue to believe we'll have strong operating cash flow. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 40.8 days for the first quarter compared to 42.1 days in last year's first quarter. Our inventory turns for the first quarter were 5.2 turns and that's essentially unchanged versus last year. In addition, I'll note that we recently amended our revolving credit facility increasing the maximum borrowing amount by $250 million from $500 million to $750 million and extended the term through 2022. This facility supports our long-term internal and acquisition growth strategies, while maintaining a strong capital structure. I'll now conclude my remarks by affirming our 2017 financial guidance. Diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is expected to be $7.17 to $7.30 for 2017. That guidance reflects growth of 16% to 18% compared to the GAAP 2016 diluted EPS and 8% to 10% compared to the non-GAAP diluted EPS, which excludes restructuring costs in the prior year. Let me remind you that fiscal 2017 include one less week than fiscal 2016. I'll also note that guidance for 2017 diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein is for current continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of potential future acquisitions, if any. And guidance also assumes that foreign exchange rates for our major international businesses are generally consistent with current levels. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Stanley. Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review of our four business groups with the Dental Group. We believe we continue to gain market share in our Global Dental business in the first quarter. In North America, our dental consumable merchandise internal sales growth was 2.5% in local currency, which was the highest quarterly growth rate in the past several quarters. We estimate the 2.5% growth rate to be approximately 3% when adjusting for the impact of precious metals in the quarter. Of course, I think as Steven mentioned, the impact of the holiday, and the holidays actually  and that should be taken into account that but overall we continue to be very pleased and believe with our consumable dental sales in North America believe that we continue to gain market share in this area. While North American equipment internal sales in local currencies declined for the reasons, which Steven explained, our equipment backlog for the second quarter of 2017 is strong, which we believe indicates a resumption in the year-over-year growth. We believe that dentists are, in fact, investing in their practices and this, of course, is good for our equipment business. As part of our ongoing efforts to advance our leadership position in the dental equipment and specialty dental  specifically the digital dentistry, we are pleased to announce that we entered into a three-year agreement with Dentsply Sirona effective September 1, 2017, to distribute Dentsply Sirona's full line of dental equipment in the United States. As you may know, we are the leading distributor of Dentsply Sirona dental equipment in European markets today and we are also a leading supplier of Dentsply consumable merchandise around the world. Dentsply Sirona and Henry Schein have been excellent business partners for decades, and we are pleased to expand this longstanding and successful relationship. Of course, our commitment to our dental customers has always been to offer a broad selection of products, including equipment, consumables and value-added services that enable our customers to provide high-quality care to their patients, while realizing greater practice efficiency. Well, this agreement with Dentsply Sirona, Henry Schein will offer dentist and dental laboratories in the United States a greater selection of digital dental equipment solutions with a full range of the Dentsply Sirona equipment, including the leading CEREC brand of CAD-CAM product. The addition of this dental product line, combined with the products manufactured by our other valued equipment supplier partners, further this commitment by Henry Schein to providing greater access to the broadest range of high-quality dental equipment products. Our Dental platform accented on offering our customers choice across a number of high-quality dental equipment systems that most importantly are interoperable Henry Schein's practice solutions software platform. Adding the full Dentsply Sirona equipment product line rounds up an excellent suite of digital technology solutions offered by Henry Schein to help dentist advance their practice in the digital age. There is a huge opportunity to expand the digitalization of dentistry and we are very, very pleased with our offering, our expanded offering, and the work we've done in the past with those existing suppliers that have provided Henry Schein with digital technology. In addition to the Dentsply Sirona equipment products, we will continue to represent products from Planmeca, 3Shape and 3M as well as the dental equipment and consumer product lines of our longstanding partner, Danaher under the KaVo Kerr brands. Due to the timing of the agreements with Dentsply Sirona and initial trading startup expenses, Henry Schein expects that earnings related to this agreement will be neutral to our 2017 financial results and accretive in years thereafter in 2018 and 2019 and beyond. We are, of course, excited to expand our partnership with Dentsply Sirona as we broaden our digital dentistry product offering with the highly respected global brands associated with Dentsply Sirona. We believe that today, together, Henry Schein and Dentsply Sirona will help accelerate the adoption of dental and dentistry for the ultimate benefit of patients in the United States and actually, around the world. So we're very pleased with this arrangement  this new arrangement to deepen our offering of products and very pleased with the relationship that we've had over the years with Sirona in Europe and with Dentsply around the world. This only aligns our business interest even further, but at the same time expand the offering that we provide to our customers and therefore it is good for the American dentists. At the recent IDS show in Germany, there were innovative, patient-oriented solutions on display, representing the continued evolution of the integrated digital workflows in the dental office. Henry Schein announced our expansion of 3Shape digital impressions scanner offering in Germany. We experienced continued year-over-year growth of our Global Dental scanner products during the first quarter of 2017, and we will continue to offer a broad set of CAD-CAM and other equipment solutions offering customers technological advancements that drive efficiency and of course, high-quality dentistry. As we believe the potential for growth over time in this segment of the market  the digital segment is significant. So we're very, very excited with the digitalization of dentistry, expansion of our offering and, in fact, our position in the marketplace of advancing the introduction of digital technology to dentists in this country and of course, abroad. At IDS, we also introduced CAMLOG serolog implant system, including a full range of ceramic implant products. Ceramic implants meet the growing customer demand for aesthetics, metal-free materials, the combination of the aesthetics and the metal-free materials we believe will be important to implant dentists. And we believe that CAMLOG is well positioned to yet introduce another area of advancement in dentistry. With its two-piece design, serolog products enable greater flexibility for restorations with this material. We believe ceramic implant products have the potential to grow significantly and become a disruptive technology given the benefits for the patient's oral care. Our ConnectDental and DEDICAM digital platform support dentist and laboratories in their efforts integrate digital technology into each dental clinical workflow for restorative dentistry. At the core of these platforms, that's the ConnectDental and DEDICAM and actually the bulk of the platform BioHorizons side, is a wide breadth of products of flexibility, of open architecture, so practices can choose the solutions that best meet their needs. Also, relative to our Dental business, as mentioned on our last earnings call and, of course, in the press releases that we've issued, we recently closed on the acquisition of Southern Anesthesia & Surgical, or SAS as commonly known in the marketplace, which offers surgical supplies and pharmaceuticals to approximately 11,500 oral surgeons, dentists and, of course, dental anesthesiologists and periodontists across the U.S. SAS had 2016 sales of $72 million and will be an excellent addition to our product offering targeting the needs of dental surgeons. We have already good penetration at the Henry Schein level and also at the Ace level. So we have three excellent brands to advance our work with oral surgeons, whether it is in general oral surgery or in the implant arena. So very, very pleased with performance of our Global Dental business, very pleased with the expansion of the relationship with the Dentsply Sirona company and very happy to report good progress with all of our other major suppliers, in general, whether it is in the United States or on a global basis. Now, let me turn to the Animal Health side. While the Animal Health growth in North America did moderate during the quarter, our internal international growth in local currencies was a multi-year high. Our Animal Health strategy is to deliver excellent solutions to support at prices that reflect the value we provide. Our customers rely on the products and services we offer, including our robust and clearly differentiated software platforms, all of which facilitate the delivery of quality care by veterinarians throughout the world. In January, we announced our entry into the Brazilian animal health market with a 51% investment in Tecnew, a privately held distributor of animal health products. Tecnew serves about 5,000 customers in Brazil and had 2016 sales of approximately $24 million. Also, during the first quarter, the North American Veterinary Conference was held in Orlando. There, we did launch a new Samsung-branded diagnostic chemistry instrument with bidirectional functionality and a full body of digital radiography solution from Canon. We also introduced our new Sparkline software dashboard, which integrates with our practice management software to identify key performance metrics such as revenue growth and customer retention. These products were well received as we endeavor to offer our customers a pre-script approach that specifically targets the needs of their practices. We believe that our Animal Health business in the United States and abroad continues to do well, working well with our major suppliers and are confident that we'll continue to gain market share on this side of the business. Now, let me talk about the Medical business a little bit. Our Medical business delivered double-digit sales growth in the first quarter. This reflects particularly strong patient traffic to physician offices, particularly related to the late flu season, as well as our continued execution in serving the market as it's consolidating among large group practices, including the integrated delivery network. We are well-positioned to help primary care practices and ambulatory surgical centers operate efficiently so our customers can focus on patient outcomes. We believe that promoting wellness and prevention is key to the future of improving the healthcare landscape. And that is precisely the part of healthcare that our customers are engaged with. In line with helping physicians provide better clinical care, we recently announced an exclusive distribution agreement with Rijuven to sell its CardioSleeve diagnostic device to medical practitioners. CardioSleeve is the world's first stethoscope attachment that provides electrocardiogram and heart data via Bluetooth for instant analysis, another reflection of the digitalization of healthcare and area that we are highly committed to advancing. This product is an excellent example of our expansion of innovative medical devices in our portfolio that we are helping doctors provide effective treatment and more efficient care. We expect to continue to offer our customers this expanding suite of innovative medical device solutions. Again, very pleased not only with our Dental and Animal Health performance, but on the Medical side as well. Technology and Value-Added Services components, although we saw some softness in the North American Technology and Value-Added Services, internal sales growth for this quarter, we're pleased with our performance in electronic services sales area, most of which is reoccurring revenue as we continue to penetrate our customer base for these value-added services. As Steven mentioned, our Technology and Value-Added Services sales had strong double-digit growth, and was, of course, slightly impacted by the level of financial services revenue, but in general, we are very pleased with the performance of this group and specifically as it relates to the recurring revenue, electronic-commerce part of the business. And of course, enhancing our technology solutions offering is an important initiative as we empower our customers more with the tools we provide them to help boost productivity and, yes, improve efficiency in the practice. So before we take the questions, I'd like to note a couple of other highlights for the quarter. In February, we celebrated together with American Dental Association Foundation the 15th annual Give Kids A Smile program. This is an initiative to which dental teams provide free oral care and education to underserved children across the U.S. It is estimated that nearly 300,000 underserved children received free oral health screenings, education and treatment under this program each year. Care is delivered by more than 30,000 dental volunteers, including 8,000 dentists to use our healthcare products donated by Henry Schein and our suppliers. We're very pleased with this longstanding partnership with American Dental Association, a true public-private partnership, which at the end of the day, advances the needs of society, while enhancing the Henry Schein brand. In March, Henry Schein was recognized by Ethisphere Institute as a 2017 World's Most Ethical Company, marking the sixth consecutive year we received this recognition. The Ethisphere Institute is a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. It is truly an honor to be recognized among some of the world's most respected businesses for our commitment to ethical business practices and of course, corporate social responsibility. With those comments, operator, we are now ready to take questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Your first question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks, guys, and good morning. I'll try to keep it to two real tight ones. Steven, the first one, on the tax rate of 27%, I believe that gives you roughly an extra $0.10 for the year but not moving the guidance. So maybe if you can just give some thoughts on the level of conservatism for the year and is that 27% tax rate the right one to extrapolate out to 2018 and beyond? And then, Stanley, I'll take a shot here in terms of when you mentioned net neutral to 2017 the deal with Dentsply Sirona but accretive in 2018, any sense in the level of accretion in 2018 and beyond if  not specific in terms of EPS just maybe some more detailed thoughts there? Thanks, guys. Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc. Okay. I'll take the first part of your question. So on the current year, still early in the year versus our guidance, it's probably about $0.06 improved versus our guidance. Remember, we said 23% to 24% effective tax rate going into the quarter for Q1 came in at 20.7%. So that represents approximately $0.06. I would say we have a relatively wide range of $0.13 in our guidance. It's early in the year. There are a number of puts and takes, including foreign exchange that we need to keep a watchful eye on. So at this point, we felt that the prudent thing was to just reaffirm guidance and not to change guidance at this time and let's see how the year progresses. With respect to our tax rate going forward, so it's a little bit difficult to quantify. I would expect that we should still see a similar benefit in future years. But remember, it depends on two key factors for us. First factor is the stock appreciation, which is hard to estimate, and the second factor for us is because a number of our shares are performance based, how many shares actually vest based on the performance. So it might not be quite the same impact in future years because we had a very favorable on both of those counts this year, but we would expect that there would still be a tax benefit in each Q1 going forward. Again, may not be quite as great as what we saw this year. Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. So on the impact of adding the Dentsply Sirona line, first, this year, there will be significant expenses in bringing on board a comprehensive line. This will entail, of course, a tremendous amount of education and training, taking our salespeople and our technicians out to the field. And of course, adding some additional team members for capacity. So the impact of that is factored into the guidance that Steven has rendered. As it relates to next year and beyond, we remain very excited with Henry Schein's key strategy to advance digital dentistry on a global basis. We think that digital dentistry will increase the efficiency of the practice, while at the same time, providing better quality in healthcare, better quality of oral care in the dental practice. We cannot give you the direct impact on the expansion of the strategy, and we believe that by adding the Dentsply Sirona equipment line to our business, we will, in fact, expand our strategy and expand our strategy even faster as we implement the  as we expand the line and implement further our plans on digital dentistry. But I think it would be premature to provide a direct impact on the line. And in fact, on introducing the line, I don't think it's a good idea for us to talk about the impact of any specific supplier rather than talk about the category, and we will, of course, report back to the extent we can on the impact of digital dentistry on our overall business. And that has been pretty good for the last few years. We have introduced many, many dentist with digital technology, specifically through our scanner lines and I might add some full chair side units as well, while at the same time, servicing the needs from a digital transformation point of view of dental labs throughout the world where we believe we are the biggest provider of products that is the dental labs. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones, Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for the question. And just to follow up, appreciate you're somewhat limited obviously, Stanley, what you can say about the new agreement with Dentsply Sirona. But I just wanted to maybe ask a more strategic question around the new arrangement. Should we anticipate any change in your go-to-market strategy? If I think about the U.S. market kind of post you having access to this product line, there are arguably, less differentiation between your product portfolio and your largest competitors. So just curious if there's any change that you foresee in the sales force and their go-to-market strategy? And I guess, just related to that, should we expect any disruption in your sales force as they take on this new portfolio? Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. I don't  I think it's a very good question. But I don't think much changes from a go-to-market strategy. We have been building our digital technology capacity for the last four years, perhaps even five years and our goal is to provide the best comprehensive solution to dentists. Of course, there's a significant tie-in to our practice solutions software, which over the years has moved from being an accounting system to a clinical solution. There's a lot going on in that area, we've invested heavily. A lot of those expenses are run through the value-added services component of our P&L, which is shown separately. We've added the Ascend software in the area of cloud-based software, these have been significant expenses, and they all tie in one way or another to our digital equipment. Interoperability is something that's important for Henry Schein on the equipment side now for several years. So I don't think much changes in our strategy. We will continue to add more resources into this area. We have added more resources over the last few years and we'll continue to do that. Of course, by expanding our offering, we will now have more competitive offering, although I might hasten to add that our existing suppliers provide us with good products, but the CEREC brand is clearly the innovator, perceived as the innovator and has been an innovator in this space for a long, long time. We do well with the CEREC brand in Europe, but I think it is important to realize that Henry Schein is committed to differentiating ourselves to the value-added services we offer to our customers. So there's a lot more than a particular brand or a particular product. Of course, we're happy to have, excited to have the Dentsply Sirona equipment line but it's the value-added service and the tie-in with our practice solutions and other value-added services that is the differentiator. I don't think there will be disruptions in our sales force. This is an exciting product to add, but it will not be significant material as it relates to our total Dental business of $6 billion or so. So it is an important line. We're excited. We think we can partner very well with Dentsply Sirona. We have a lot of other manufacturers that we do well with. Everybody in dentistry, every manufacturer understands the importance of digital dentistry. Everybody is committed to this, and we look forward to working with a broader array of suppliers, albeit the Dentsply Sirona equipment line is an outstanding line and I don't think we will have disruption either with our suppliers or with our customers. And I think we will have steady growth in this area of digital dentistry as we've experienced over the last year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson, Robert Baird. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thank you. Good morning, guys. So Stanley and Steven, let me just ask one other question on the Dentsply relationship if I could. Steve, you were talking about it being neutral for the back half of this year, accretive thereafter. You will have expenses early on. Just from a gating standpoint, should we think of the expenses really kind of coming in third quarter and then some revenue offsetting the expenses in the fourth quarter? So just want to make sure we set up our models appropriately or between the third quarter expense and fourth quarter benefit maybe mixed? Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc. Yeah. So remember, the agreement does not start until September 1, so no revenues can be recognized by us before September 1. So I would say that  and it'll take a little bit of time for us to build an order book on the product line. So I don't think right out-of-the-box, we're going to be going at 100%. I would say that what we'll also see some expenses in the same quarter, starting a little bit before the September 1 date to train the sales force and do things like that, but we'll start seeing it in the same quarter. But we're not looking at really any significant quarterly impact for Q3 and Q4. We're trying really to have it relatively neutral in each quarter, although it might be a little bit negative in the first quarter Q3 versus Q4. We haven't given guidance going forward. I don't know we feel comfortable it will be accretive. And I think you have to give us a little bit of time to see later this year how we do in order to really have some specificity on the impact of it. While we're very excited, remember, we also support other manufacturers. So there will be a net impact that we have to look at for us. There are product categories that we're selling other manufacturers. But the net impact was supposed to be positive. And again, we're pleased to have the Dentsply Sirona line in place now. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger, William Blair. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC Hi. Thanks very much. How does your dental implant line do in the quarter? And then, Stanley, may be more broadly, what were your observations coming of IDS? Just curious what you view as sort of any key innovations coming out of that show that you think could be the more profound growers for the industry over the next three, four years? Thanks. Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. Yeah. And Steven will give you information on the implant line to the extent we actually provide that data because we generally do not provide category growth. Having said that, Steven provides color, please remember that we have an implant business and then we have businesses that provide products around the implant. And when you compare performances of us to others, remember, that the implant companies are showing a broad line of products, not only implants but products around the implant. So, it's very hard to compare our performance, but generally we are very pleased with our oral surgeon business for implants for bone regenerations, products and the products around the implants. The second question was - John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC Just strategically on the implant line, how the market is doing? Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. Yeah. Well, I think the market for implants is growing quite nicely throughout the world. I would say that it's pretty good in the U.S. Europe is a bit more muted, but the developing world is growing significantly. So I think it's a good area to be in. And perhaps the most exciting part of the implant business, and I would say that's, with all the specialties, is an investment by specialists in digital technology, be it in the prosthetic side or in the imaging side. So specialists generally are investing more in the practices because, of course, they have the earning power and this is driving our equipment sales throughout the world. Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc. And just to give you a little color on our overall performance for implants and this is excluding  it's really just the implants, not the products around the implants. On a worldwide basis, we grew in the mid-single digits or slightly higher than that overall with stronger growth in the U.S. and slightly less growth internationally. And overall, we think that we at least maybe outpaced the market by a little bit in the quarter. Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. You also asked about IDS, I think there was a customary amount of new products. I don't think it was extraordinary from the point of view of new products. From a sales point of view, they were very good for Henry Schein Germany and the countries around Germany because generally orders are placed by dentists from those countries. It's not an order booking business on a global basis. Of course, there were distributors and manufacturers that come to the show from around the world, but from an order point of view it's really a Germany, Austria, may be The Netherlands and a little bit extra, and we did well from that point of view. Of course, the area of greatest focus was the CAD-CAM area. We saw some advances in scanners, molds, (49:06) and I think all are more or less in line with what we shared on previous calls. The whole CAD-CAM area is getting better in terms of capabilities, efficiencies, and it's becoming more affordable. So from that point of view, there was a lot showing there. From Henry Schein point of view, we're very pleased with our advancements, the offering, an expanded offering, the technology advancements on the implant side, but overall, I would say, it was a solid meeting from an attendant's point of view. Pretty okay from products, but I wouldn't say a revolutionary show from a product innovation point of view. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette, BofA Merrill Lynch. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks. Good morning, Stan and Steve. Impressive results and also congrats on the new Sirona dental equipment deal, which I also have a question on. So I guess at a high level, is there perhaps any extra color that you're able to give around the magnitude of under penetration of CEREC, in particular, into the legacy Henry Schein distribution customers in the U.S. relative to the overall U.S. market penetration rates for CEREC? I'm sure you've done plenty of studies on this, but just wonder if you're able to share anything? Thanks. Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. Sure. There are more studies on this area than probably fact, but it is clear there's a highly underpenetrated area. I think that the number of dentists that either have a scanner or a full service is relatively small. It's probably under 20%. Some say it's as low as 15%, some say it's 17%, doesn't matter because there's 80% of dentists that don't have digital prosthetics in any way, any form at all. So we think it's as an exciting market as the digital imaging markets, and we've done very well in that market with lots more to go because we still have a lot of dentist that have wet X-rays in their practices. So digital imaging is an exciting market. It's a bit more penetrated, actually quite a bit more penetrated than the prosthetics, but the prosthetics is really an open market. And for those that even may have bought a CEREC, it may have been bought with an older version. So there's lots of opportunity for selling CEREC to customers that don't have it and to customers that wish to have a newer version. But at the same time, we also see opportunities for some of the other manufacturers on the scanning side, scan-only side, and that's not only in the dental practice but in the dental lab practice, and it will be exciting opportunities also in the milling arena. Anticipate that there'll be some exciting opportunities from a number of manufacturers in the milling area and also I'm sure that from Sirona. So this is, in generally, a very exciting category and the advancement in blocks is exciting. So the digitalization of dentistry, which we spoke about six years or seven years ago from a prosthetics point of view is really going to be an area that is going to help Henry Schein grow our Dental business in the future as we advanced the connectivity between our practice management software, digital imaging, digital prosthetics and improving the entire work stream in the office to drive more efficiency and better healthcare. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Hagan of Deutsche Bank. Stephen R. Hagan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. In International Dental, did you see a pause in the equipment sales ahead of IDS and equipment sales were still up 3% despite this, or was the strength because of fewer dentists waited for IDS than expected? And also what are the particular geographies that drove the strength in International Dental? Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. I'll let Steven answer the second component. I mean, we had  as I think I mentioned, we had a very good IDS from the order taking point of view. But I would say that, that was specifically related to Germany and to Austria, a little bit in The Netherlands. Because generally customers don't come to buy from beyond those markets, perhaps a little bit from Eastern Europe but not much. Overall, we had a good quarter in the equipment business and in our international markets. I think that, that was mostly related to countries outside of the Germanic speaking countries where we are doing well with equipment in Europe. So I think you have to bifurcate the market a bit, you have to look at the Germanic countries and the rest of Europe. And there was, of course, in the Germanic countries, although it was a decent quarter and I think at least from our point of view, we expect to have decent sales in the second quarter in the Germanic countries and don't really see much of a pause in our growth in our international business, in general. Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc. Yeah. And I'll just reiterate what Stanley said, really the softness, which was probably related to IDS was in the Germanic countries, but it was offset somewhat  more than somewhat was offset by other parts of our International Dental business. And that's typical. You don't typically see people going to IDS to buy equipment from, for example, the U.K, really it's Germany and the surrounding countries where the purchasing habits buying equipment, although people may come from all over the world just to see the different types of equipment. So again, we're expecting a bit of a pickup in Germany but that will be muted by some of the other countries that were very strong also in Q1. Operator We do have time for one more question. David Larsen of Leerink Partners. Matt Dellelo - Leerink Partners LLC Hey, guys. It's Matt in for Dave. Congrats on a strong quarter. Just want to ask about a couple areas. You mentioned relatively slower Animal Health. Is there anything to read into the growth moderation there or is that just seasonal in North America? And then any other color on the relative softness in technology for the quarter, or is that also just seasonal or cyclical? Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. I don't think you should read anything into the numbers in the Animal Health arena in North America. There were some switching around some suppliers, in particular, supplier between us and the competitor. There were some switching between agency and GAAP booking of the full sales. We continue to believe that we're doing very well in the companion area of Animal Health, from a consumable point of view, general consumables, pharma, equipment. The holidays, there's so many different things that go into this. But I think if you take a look at any particular four quarters in our Animal Health, you will see that, I think, we're gaining market share and the business is doing very well. We did have our National Sales Meeting during the quarter. It was a very good sales meeting. I don't know the extent it impacted sales but overall our Animal Health is doing well. On the technology side, the core leading indicator we look at is in the e-commerce arena and the various kinds of transactions we undertake on behalf of our customers. I think that's all very good, solid. You have to also look at the financial revenue primarily leasing from our financial services business, which was a little bit weaker taking into account that our sales on a comparable basis on equipment were a little lower. But I would not read anything into it and  nor would I assume that double-digit sales growth on the Medical side of our business is normal. I think we are very pleased with our internal growth for the company of 5.9%, which take a guess is anywhere between 2 times to 3 times the market growth, we're gaining market share in all of our business in a global basis. Very pleased we are managing our investment in the business very carefully. We're optimistic about the future specifically as it relates to increasing the value-added service offering. And so we were very pleased with the business, in general. It's hard to get every single number perfectly aligned every quarter but overall the bottom  the sales  the internal sales, the operating margin and the EPS growth is something that we're very pleased with. We're working on our strategic plan now for 2018, 2019 and 2020, so many opportunities and the challenge is always about determining what we're not going to do rather than what to do  capitalizing on specific opportunities. Henry Schein has so many opportunities in Dental, Medical, Animal Health space and we're excited about the future and our management team is excited to be advancing our strategies, more in the company is great. And we continue to look forward to creating shareholder value for our shareholders. So thank you all for calling in. If you have any questions, of course, Steve Paladino is always available as our CFO at 631-843-5915 and Carolynne Borders on the Investor Relations side. Carolynne? Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc. 631-390-8105. Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. And I think we're all going to be out at the... Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc. Bank of America. Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. ...Bank of America Conference on Tuesday, next week. Look forward to seeing those investors that are going to be there. If you're not there, I believe it will be webcast. So we'll try to provide as much information as practical and appropriate. And we're very, very excited with the addition of the Dentsply Sirona line, but also so grateful and appreciative of those manufacturers that have worked with us to get us to where we are. We believe we have the deepest bench in management and really a broad array of products and solutions with Dental, Medical and Animal Health market. So thank you very much for calling in.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Your first question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks, guys, and good morning. I'll try to keep it to two real tight ones. Steven, the first one, on the tax rate of 27%, I believe that gives you roughly an extra $0.10 for the year but not moving the guidance. So maybe if you can just give some thoughts on the level of conservatism for the year and is that 27% tax rate the right one to extrapolate out to 2018 and beyond? And then, Stanley, I'll take a shot here in terms of when you mentioned net neutral to 2017 the deal with Dentsply Sirona but accretive in 2018, any sense in the level of accretion in 2018 and beyond if  not specific in terms of EPS just maybe some more detailed thoughts there? Thanks, guys. Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc. Okay. I'll take the first part of your question. So on the current year, still early in the year versus our guidance, it's probably about $0.06 improved versus our guidance. Remember, we said 23% to 24% effective tax rate going into the quarter for Q1 came in at 20.7%. So that represents approximately $0.06. I would say we have a relatively wide range of $0.13 in our guidance. It's early in the year. There are a number of puts and takes, including foreign exchange that we need to keep a watchful eye on. So at this point, we felt that the prudent thing was to just reaffirm guidance and not to change guidance at this time and let's see how the year progresses. With respect to our tax rate going forward, so it's a little bit difficult to quantify. I would expect that we should still see a similar benefit in future years. But remember, it depends on two key factors for us. First factor is the stock appreciation, which is hard to estimate, and the second factor for us is because a number of our shares are performance based, how many shares actually vest based on the performance. So it might not be quite the same impact in future years because we had a very favorable on both of those counts this year, but we would expect that there would still be a tax benefit in each Q1 going forward. Again, may not be quite as great as what we saw this year. Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. So on the impact of adding the Dentsply Sirona line, first, this year, there will be significant expenses in bringing on board a comprehensive line. This will entail, of course, a tremendous amount of education and training, taking our salespeople and our technicians out to the field. And of course, adding some additional team members for capacity. So the impact of that is factored into the guidance that Steven has rendered. As it relates to next year and beyond, we remain very excited with Henry Schein's key strategy to advance digital dentistry on a global basis. We think that digital dentistry will increase the efficiency of the practice, while at the same time, providing better quality in healthcare, better quality of oral care in the dental practice. We cannot give you the direct impact on the expansion of the strategy, and we believe that by adding the Dentsply Sirona equipment line to our business, we will, in fact, expand our strategy and expand our strategy even faster as we implement the  as we expand the line and implement further our plans on digital dentistry.

Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger, William Blair. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC Hi. Thanks very much. How does your dental implant line do in the quarter? And then, Stanley, may be more broadly, what were your observations coming of IDS?

Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks. Good morning, Stan and Steve. Impressive results and also congrats on the new Sirona dental equipment deal, which I also have a question on. So I guess at a high level, is there perhaps any extra color that you're able to give around the magnitude of under penetration of CEREC, in particular, into the legacy Henry Schein distribution customers in the U.S. relative to the overall U.S. market penetration rates for CEREC? I'm sure you've done plenty of studies on this, but just wonder if you're able to share anything? Thanks. Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. Sure. There are more studies on this area than probably fact, but it is clear there's a highly underpenetrated area. I think that the number of dentists that either have a scanner or a full service is relatively small. It's probably under 20%. Some say it's as low as 15%, some say it's 17%, doesn't matter because there's 80% of dentists that don't have digital prosthetics in any way, any form at all. So we think it's as an exciting market as the digital imaging markets, and we've done very well in that market with lots more to go because we still have a lot of dentist that have wet X-rays in their practices. So digital imaging is an exciting market. It's a bit more penetrated, actually quite a bit more penetrated than the prosthetics, but the prosthetics is really an open market. And for those that even may have bought a CEREC, it may have been bought with an older version. So there's lots of opportunity for selling CEREC to customers that don't have it and to customers that wish to have a newer version. But at the same time, we also see opportunities for some of the other manufacturers on the scanning side, scan-only side, and that's not only in the dental practice but in the dental lab practice, and it will be exciting opportunities also in the milling arena. Anticipate that there'll be some exciting opportunities from a number of manufacturers in the milling area and also I'm sure that from Sirona. So this is, in generally, a very exciting category and the advancement in blocks is exciting. So the digitalization of dentistry, which we spoke about six years or seven years ago from a prosthetics point of view is really going to be an area that is going to help Henry Schein grow our Dental business in the future as we advanced the connectivity between our practice management software, digital imaging, digital prosthetics and improving the entire work stream in the office to drive more efficiency and better healthcare. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Hagan of Deutsche Bank. Stephen R. Hagan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. In International Dental, did you see a pause in the equipment sales ahead of IDS and equipment sales were still up 3% despite this, or was the strength because of fewer dentists waited for IDS than expected? And also what are the particular geographies that drove the strength in International Dental? Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. I'll let Steven answer the second component. I mean, we had  as I think I mentioned, we had a very good IDS from the order taking point of view. But I would say that, that was specifically related to Germany and to Austria, a little bit in The Netherlands. Because generally customers don't come to buy from beyond those markets, perhaps a little bit from Eastern Europe but not much. Overall, we had a good quarter in the equipment business and in our international markets. I think that, that was mostly related to countries outside of the Germanic speaking countries where we are doing well with equipment in Europe. So I think you have to bifurcate the market a bit, you have to look at the Germanic countries and the rest of Europe. And there was, of course, in the Germanic countries, although it was a decent quarter and I think at least from our point of view, we expect to have decent sales in the second quarter in the Germanic countries and don't really see much of a pause in our growth in our international business, in general. Steven Paladino - Henry Schein, Inc. Yeah. And I'll just reiterate what Stanley said, really the softness, which was probably related to IDS was in the Germanic countries, but it was offset somewhat  more than somewhat was offset by other parts of our International Dental business. And that's typical. You don't typically see people going to IDS to buy equipment from, for example, the U.K, really it's Germany and the surrounding countries where the purchasing habits buying equipment, although people may come from all over the world just to see the different types of equipment. So again, we're expecting a bit of a pickup in Germany but that will be muted by some of the other countries that were very strong also in Q1. Operator We do have time for one more question. David Larsen of Leerink Partners. Matt Dellelo - Leerink Partners LLC Hey, guys. It's Matt in for Dave. Congrats on a strong quarter. Just want to ask about a couple areas. You mentioned relatively slower Animal Health. Is there anything to read into the growth moderation there or is that just seasonal in North America? And then any other color on the relative softness in technology for the quarter, or is that also just seasonal or cyclical? Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. I don't think you should read anything into the numbers in the Animal Health arena in North America. There were some switching around some suppliers, in particular, supplier between us and the competitor. There were some switching between agency and GAAP booking of the full sales. We continue to believe that we're doing very well in the companion area of Animal Health, from a consumable point of view, general consumables, pharma, equipment. The holidays, there's so many different things that go into this. But I think if you take a look at any particular four quarters in our Animal Health, you will see that, I think, we're gaining market share and the business is doing very well. We did have our National Sales Meeting during the quarter. It was a very good sales meeting. I don't know the extent it impacted sales but overall our Animal Health is doing well. On the technology side, the core leading indicator we look at is in the e-commerce arena and the various kinds of transactions we undertake on behalf of our customers. I think that's all very good, solid. You have to also look at the financial revenue primarily leasing from our financial services business, which was a little bit weaker taking into account that our sales on a comparable basis on equipment were a little lower. But I would not read anything into it and  nor would I assume that double-digit sales growth on the Medical side of our business is normal. I think we are very pleased with our internal growth for the company of 5.9%, which take a guess is anywhere between 2 times to 3 times the market growth, we're gaining market share in all of our business in a global basis. Very pleased we are managing our investment in the business very carefully. We're optimistic about the future specifically as it relates to increasing the value-added service offering. And so we were very pleased with the business, in general. It's hard to get every single number perfectly aligned every quarter but overall the bottom  the sales  the internal sales, the operating margin and the EPS growth is something that we're very pleased with. We're working on our strategic plan now for 2018, 2019 and 2020, so many opportunities and the challenge is always about determining what we're not going to do rather than what to do  capitalizing on specific opportunities. Henry Schein has so many opportunities in Dental, Medical, Animal Health space and we're excited about the future and our management team is excited to be advancing our strategies, more in the company is great. And we continue to look forward to creating shareholder value for our shareholders. So thank you all for calling in. If you have any questions, of course, Steve Paladino is always available as our CFO at 631-843-5915 and Carolynne Borders on the Investor Relations side. Carolynne? Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc. 631-390-8105. Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. And I think we're all going to be out at the... Carolynne Borders - Henry Schein, Inc. Bank of America. Stanley M. Bergman - Henry Schein, Inc. ...Bank of America Conference on Tuesday, next week. Look forward to seeing those investors that are going to be there. If you're not there, I believe it will be webcast. So we'll try to provide as much information as practical and appropriate. And we're very, very excited with the addition of the Dentsply Sirona line, but also so grateful and appreciative of those manufacturers that have worked with us to get us to where we are. We believe we have the deepest bench in management and really a broad array of products and solutions with Dental, Medical and Animal Health market. So thank you very much for calling in.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Glenn Schiffman, CEO. Please go ahead, sir. Glenn Schiffman Thank you, Operator. Good morning everyone. Glenn Schiffman here and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today is Joey Levin, our CEO. Weve taken a lot of time this week, so appreciate you given us a little more here. As you know Match Group held their first quarter earnings call yesterday morning. The focus of this call will be IAC ex-Match. Similar to last quarter supplemental to our quarterly earnings release, we have also published our quarterly shareholder letter. We will not be reading our shareholder letter on this call. It is currently available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will shortly turn the call over to Joey to make a few brief introductory remarks and then we will open it up to Q&A. Before we get to that, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we may discuss our outlook and future performance. These forward-looking statements typically may be preceded by words such as, we expect, we believe, we anticipate, or similar statements. These forward-looking views are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from the views expressed here today. Some of the risks have been set forth in our fourth quarter press release and reports filed with the SEC. We'll also discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which as a reminder include adjusted EBITDA, which we'll refer to today as EBITDA, for simplicity during the call. I'll also refer you to our press release and, again, to the Investor Relations section of our website for all comparable GAAP measures and a full reconciliation for all material non-GAAP measures. Finally, in connection with the proposed Angie's List transaction we expect to file documents with the SEC, you are urged to read those documents once filed because they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. You can obtain free copies of the documents we filed with the SEC by contacting Investor Relations or from the SECs website.  Now let's jump right into it, Joey? Joey Levin Good morning, everybody. I'm cognizant of the fact that this is your third hour with us this week so let's try and be brief and I know its much more for me to say, but lets get right into questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Yes. You're ready for questions? Joey Levin I am. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And well take our first question from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Jason Helfstein Thanks. Kind of I guess two related and then one housekeeping. So first question how does HomeAdvisor being or soon to be a separate entity makes you think about the rest of IAC in your decisions around allocating capital with respect to the rest of the stub. Number two, what are the risks to integrate both businesses as you intend to hit your $270 million EBITDA target. And then just lastly, more of a housekeeping, I assume that stock comp will be a significant component for the senior management at Angie HomeAdvisor. Could you help us understand the dilution if Chris and his team are successful? Thanks. Joey Levin Sure. All good questions. On the rest of IAC and allocating capital, I don't think anything changes with this trend, I think you know will certainly start to focus more on the other businesses as kind of whenever we've done a transaction like this it highlights one business in a very specific unique way and then allow us to focus on the earlier stages, smaller businesses. So well in terms of attention, you know, well start focusing a lot of energy and attention on those businesses, but I don't think anything changes as it relates to capital allocation or any of the big sort of corporate organization capitalization decisions. The you know, we've got a great set of businesses still in that IAC seen out excluding both Match and HomeAdvisor, Video the kind of biggest most interesting - sorry not biggest, but biggest sort of long term potential we think but applications still a great consistent stable business and publishing with a really now I think now having stabilized potentially interesting future. So there's a bunch of you know where I say interesting call options in their advisee on the integration risk obviously feels like this deal for this deal of complexity. There are a lot of integration risk and there's things that we will discover that we can expect and all of that. When I think about this deal and we've done a lot of deals similar to this one. You know we have this one is pretty tight as it relates to the work we've done up in advance and exactly what we have to do and knowing what we have to do and how we do it. I don't think we would have been able to say that you know 18 months ago when we made the unsolicited offer aid and we were flying blind then but be homebuyer's it was in a different state then and we got a lot bigger target for rational network now. And we've gotten you know more things light on the products. I think we're in a very. Healthy place to be able to do something like that if you want to think about it in just the most conservative way. Jason which is not the way I think about it but you might think about it and just purely the most conservative way you think about the every list and is a very big affiliate for home advisor and you know how I think that audience that very brand conscious audience very specific highly qualified high quality audience. I think that audience will perform relative to say are we qualified affiliate or our best qualified affiliates. I imagine that it did meaningfully better than our best affiliate and we know how to deal with traffic like that offer that there is a huge amount of traffic that we think is kind of underutilized at any in the sense that they still haven't got the pay wall but that opened up a lot of opportunities. I think there's still opportunities to unlock in that transition. But if you say okay and get comfortable that the traffic is there and the that that - that other knows what to do with traffic like that and how to convert traffic like that in a way that is you know delivers a great consumer experience and delivers a great service professional experience that will open your service rational network absorb that kind of traffic. And we take a lot of comfort in the fact that we had two hundred million of unused cash last year in 2016. Now I don't know the traffic lined up perfectly with all that crap but I do think that that is the best. Give us a lot of comfort and kind of how we can handle that traffic. And on the cost side you know we've been looking at this for a while we've been studying this business for a while and we've dug in very deep with Angie's List and we've built this from the ground up and so I think we're reasonably confident and what we can deliver there. But like I said all of this has risk and all deals have risk and I am certain that notwithstanding everything I did said we were buying things we didn't expect. Jason Helfstein Both positive and negative. On StarCraft it's a great question. The there will be... Joey Levin Dilution for the management team for sure I get it is probably in a typical range growth 3 4 % something like that to the team. And you know that we see that that's over time and come into play over time but they will definitely quite deservedly have a nice piece of the company and be paid well. I think that answers your questions Jason The only thing is look in terms of execution of execution rest our confidence in our management team given what they've done over the last couple of years couldn't be better placed. Next question please Operator Thank you. We'll move to Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Brian Fitzgerald Thanks guys. A couple of questions on video. First we saw that you're shifting the video channel launch to. That's right. Can you provide more color there and maybe an updated plan around those initiatives. And then historically you shun advertising on DeMeo, but what would you consider maybe a 30 second pre-roll medrol [ph] in the future to further monetize content. You know you have some great longer form caught up there and we feel and I would absolutely be palatable at least from our perspective. Joey Levin On the shifting in the US but basically we hired a woman who is handling programming and a lot of Mayo who we think is fantastic she came in a few weeks into the job and my office and she said I can deliver you great content by the end of 17. But if I want to deliver you the best content I'm going to be delivering you that slate in 2018 for the 2018. And I said were let's go to that and we're not harassed until little will launch that in 2018 see that take down the law or reduces the law in 2017 in that business and everything else is going great video. And I think on paper in terms of building the technology and product that we need we're on a good pace there. And the creator math business is doing incredibly well and today and to accelerate growth in both bookings so that's all I think a strong positive. And the answer unfortunately is the same. We are not focused on and in this business right now. I think YouTube does a very nice job in Google and YouTube to a very nice job in that ad supported video product and that's just not our focus. I suppose that could change at some point. I don't think that's likely but I would never say never and we're always open to what makes sense for the business and our customers. And we will always think about it but I continue to say that's pretty unlikely. Brian Fitzgerald Thanks Joe. Operator Thank you. Mr. John Blackledge with Cowen. John Blackledge Thanks. Two questions kind of similar topic. First question. If you take iciest current share price back out it still can match back out our estimates Archdeacon Angie home services back out to net net cash to us it implies a negative cost a billion dollars which seems absurd. Joe Andrew Glenn question is kind of like what's your take you on the math and how do you solve this on your side. And then similar topic to Jason's question Joy. In a letter you mentioned you're going to continue to find build manage and grow great companies to come around compound capital for shareholders. Do you think you have another match it or homemade bombs simmering at and I see at the moment? Thanks. Joey Levin Thank you. Yeah I mean it's hard to have I think you're in the neighbourhood. I get blasted this morning and chuckle because that's always the case thinking of how I met with a celebrated analyst and I see right after we did the next IPO and he was saying well you know part of the story how we got there like the one we just you know do an IPO math and we are not today. Well what about that. Look, I mean it's something we have we have you know now the other company out of the one I see at some point I hope we get credit for a pattern here but maybe we never will. I don't know if I don't lose too much sleep over it. But the math is whatever the math is. I mean I think we argue every day having to prove ourselves on what the business is and what the potential is. And we're where there again I see. I mean we talk about this in the last letter on where we were in 2009 everyone thought we are losers in 2009 and you know we've turned that into quite a bit. I feel as confident now as we did that there is lots of potential in what remains we are so maybe surprised by things in there some of the things you know obviously been the it is probably the most interesting here but we're nowhere near. I mean that's a long time I think before we're in that position for mimeo. You know there's - we like to have a lot of optionality. John Blackledge I think we're in that position right now. Other than the portfolio what was it, I didn't grow up yet. Joey Levin No I think that that's that will be answered by then that too. John Blackledge I mean we obviously have a cat bounce and we'll look to deploy that capital and we'll never stop looking to the political that's the Operator Next move on to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Peter Stabler Well our security. Good morning. A couple on Angies and HomeAdvisor. First, with regard to kind of the differences between the models. Joe what makes you think that this list model still work. How do you look at it when you compare it to that data intensive lead gen model that buys or has these thoughts there? And then secondly the commentary around the 200 million unused - unless I've been asleep a possibility over the last couple years I haven't really heard that talked about in terms of home advisors having unused spend or under utilized spend on Access spend. So just wondering can you give a little more color there for investors what you're talking about. Is this is commentary we're going to hear regularly going forward is it going to be something that we can track etc.. Thanks so much. Joey Levin Sure. Let me do the second one first which is this is something that we looked at for forever. It's now when we talked about it because the you know your growing supply and demand at the same time in this marketplace. And so you're always kind of constrained by one or the other. And then it can go back and forth but there isn't. There hasn't been a moment where you for example have a monumental leap in demand and the transaction enabled they've had a monumental leap and demanded that you be a monumental demand and that news kept coming into play. The concept of the capital service vessels that I'm willing to do you know I'm willing to buy three hundred dollars worth of plumbing leads every month in one Double-O 1:04 and we may only have 200 dollars worth of f those leads, and so a hundred dollars goes unspent. Now that number will never go to zero because for example you know I use this one all the time but a snow plough company might have a large cap in the summer months of were left wanting to plough in there. We're not going to find a lot of demand in the summer for those snow plough companies. But when we look at the map there are a lot of demand that we think he can fulfil in sorry when we look at that supply and escape. I think there's a lot that we think we can't fulfil with demand that we're coming from that. I don't think that the number that we report on every quarter likely I don't think it's a - it's not the driver of the business. It is an opportunity when you think about this when you have these monumental leaps in demand on the question of does the listening model work. I think the answer is yes it works for some portion of the service professional population. There we think that is the sort of larger - please those folks have working with a lot of uncomfortable things model and like that. And we're going to continue to enable that for those customers. I think that that although we presume some declines in the listings model over time I think that realistically, what happens here is the consumer decides. And I think there is a consumer. We've talked about this a lot. There is a consumer who likes the list and the model or variations on the listing model which is to get a set of choices. And for the consumer to be able to make that choice I think that long term the consumer is less interested in making those choices themselves and more interested in the platform helping them choose and getting game master actually to take the action out of that process. But we'll see. We will work to enable the product to the consumers and we're going to let the consumers decide how they want to find the service professionals. But ultimately it's going to be the really the consumer's decision of the model when and if it's a $400 billion market in the US. And so there is a lot of products that can work in a 400 billion dollar market. A lot of customers and a lot of different ways of interacting and so will try and enable all of them. Appear on and use the stairs to do better. Jason's question a little bit earlier. We have our network is growing and our business is growing. The gap is growing. So that give us more confidence are around the synergies and a lot of evidence around the execution risk. You know that phone use cap ranks right up there. And you heard me say on Tuesday you know we don't get 100 % of our budget you know for espies so. Peter Stabler Thanks, guys Operator And next to Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Dan Salmon Hey guys good morning Joe. Maybe one on HomeAdvisor. One on video on home advisories and talking at length about the 400 billion dollar addressable market in the U.S. and in the letter you know you mentioned. You are seeing a similar figure in Europe. Could you maybe expand as you know the international footprint is largely focused there on North America and Europe right now but talk a little bit about what the long term opportunity may be in emerging markets as you build a little bit of scale. And then second if you could just expand a little bit more on what really I guess on its suggestion to delay launching the service into 2018 I'm just in no doubt to be in her team was with getting a slate up and running fairly quickly and so just simply having a little bit more time makes sense. But I'm just curious as to - is this about giving her chance to get through a full development cycle. Is there an opportunity you know for her to learn a little bit more about the community that you have there already. I would imagine engaging in some of your more prolific creators on the platform already would be a priority so just if you could take us a little layer deeper on that decision. Joey Levin Thanks. Sure. On the market in the rest of the world I think. So right now we only have exposure to North America and the US and Canada and I think five markets in Europe and it is I think that realistically for the near to medium term that's about a big enough footprint. That's a lot of work for us to do. And I don't want to spread too thin. It's hard to say I wouldn't eliminate the possibility that we may open up a new market either through the organically but I don't think it's likely just as we get ready. Dan Salmon But right now we look at America and Asia I think that some of the demographic information in Latin America doesn't really work for us or at least that it will just be a little bit more complicated right now. And you know you look at things like homeownership and against condominiums or apartments or rentals where they may be where a lot of work is done by the building super. Joey Levin You look at things like GDP and the middle class and all this and which kind of maps of the world. And I think we like our footprint right now. Dan Salmon There is a market certainly there are many more markets of course outside of Europe and North America. But I think right now we pick our battles and we're going to focus there and its market that rate up to a little over 300 billion of TAM just for sex. International markets we have. So far... Joey Levin And then on video and timing. Yes, absolutely spending time 14:00 spending time looking at our existing creator base. Speaking for this angry base out in the community understanding what people can make or decision making is all these things go into the equation. I don't think we have - we don't need to be on a typical schedule a typical development cycle. You know we don't have seasons and we don't have any of concepts that carry over from where we don't want are constrained by format time of year time of day any of these things. So it is open feel then and you know that on the one hand a incredible opportunity on the other hand is it's very a very you know located problem to think about in terms of where you want to focus. And we are and no one is spending a lot of time thinking about that. But we just now started to deploy capital. Dan Salmon And I think that 2018 looks good right now. Great. Operator Thank you. And on Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse Paul Bieber Good morning thanks for taking my questions. We're hoping you get some color in return the growth in the consumer part of the application and then give us an update on the rebranding of dot calm and the vertical content strategy what you're seeing in terms of traffic growth for the sites. Joey Levin Sure. Can you do on the on applications you call our longer about 64 % year over year? And we're also our business there grew as well. The partnership business as you know is in a slow decline. And then on our core market my Sparc business we just saw - from Q in the fourth quarter. We also have had some stronger BQ in the first quarter not as strong as the as in the fourth quarter and you see a guy you know in and around that 30 million is seasonally DRP. Q Is this a little weaker in the in the second quarter but we go great about that million. The third quarter in a row that this business has exceeded 30 million there. Again given the puts and takes the growth parts of the business we're in line more than making up for the shrinking base. Paul Bieber And I already forgot the second question. Oh yes we got that. This is really so far exceeded our expectations. I don't have a number that is going to be a number you can throw him out there based basically what happened here is we split it out of six different pieces the every single one of them that it launched I think it's now in traffic and certainly relative to line. But I believe even now you're over here right. Yeah. We have a nice fast growing new public here. And as the devil you read the weather do we pull that off and I think we and check that box that the next black flies do advertisers pay attention and do advertisers understand and get excited about it. Advertisers are meaningfully move still by comScore data and our comScore car for that looks pretty exceptional right now. And these are all new branded great content with new looks. And so we've got kind of a little puddle of hair here and a pretty face. I don't have the growth numbers. Joey Levin To put in context 90 % of our r sessions will now be in the verticals that will rise to 100 %. When we launched Savion May 15th we go through each of them very well. Q One sessions are up 10 % year over year. The balance of 80 % year over year life - 100 % year over year dis-proofs is up 100 % since last the last was very recent as you guys know in February. So we're not quite up a year there. And then Flocco is up 30 % since launch. So exciting numbers indeed. Paul Bieber Okay. Thank you. Joey Levin Sure. Operator And then move on to Kerry Rice with Needham & Company Kerry Rice Thank you. You don't want to put words in your mouth but it sounds now that you would be willing or maybe the opportunity for you guys to look for acquisitions may be increasing now with this spin out of home advisor maybe some comments on that. And then just kind of a housekeeping question. Other income was down quite considerably. I don't know if there's anything to call out from that or anything that you can give us to think about how we think about that line going forward. This is beyond the interest expenses other than seven point seven million going up there. Joey Levin Yeah. When do the other thing I will say if anything has changed. I say on a scale of 1 to 10 our appetite for acquisitions in general is 10. It has always been from prior history. You know obviously we can work on a big project. And so that's the - that's taking up a lot of our time and energy and energy. But that is you know we're always looking for acquisitions and that doesn't mean we rush into things we're very patient. We only go after things really on a high level of confidence but our desire to learn is always going to be as high as it could be I think that's central to what we do. You know the other is in the fourth quarter we had a $15 million gain from the sale price from the first quarter of 3:44 quarter of 16. We are about 35 million dollar gain in respect to the sale of Chubais by 16 with really high. The other thing that flows through there from an accounting perspective is fair game the net loss is in 16 games in either of the temporary basis the mortgage market and 70. We have significant losses there and then you know any trade later or early earnings and consolidate them and roll them off not based on the functional currency of that accounting unit that translates up there's an accounting an ethics game or an ethics law again from the county perspective. The big difference as I said earlier is after sales gains and losses through flow through their end 2016 with operationalised so far as we have price runner and issue about. Kerry Rice Is the Princeton Review sale in that bucket for Q1 or is that that falls into Q2. Joey Levin Actually in Q1. Kerry Rice Okay. Thank you. Operator Next I move on to [indiscernible] Q  Unidentified Analyst Great. Thank you guided to a 35 % margin for the combined adviser company is there. I'm just curious is there another lead generation company and a category that you're using as a guide they're just trying to connect the dots between that and the single digit or so margins that the companies have been posting for the teen years or so. And then if you could any update on the web. Joey Levin I know we've talked about this before. I don't consider it like a lead generation company I consider that a marketplace that matches consumers and home service professionals. We are not in the business of buying and selling leads. That's just a fundamental misunderstanding. So when you look at marketplace businesses yet you do see the marketplaces as they get those margins. Now I don't think we're in a rush to get to those margins as we said for a while but I do certainly believe bargains like that are possible. And we've been expanding the margins of the business recently as you've seen. And on that last page I think the answer is still the same which is this is not something we're spending time day about we think is absolutely without merit. We're going to fight it vigorously. And look I think you said Mark sorry if you say we can businesses that single digit margins. I mean we've already shown that even on a consolidated basis with our losses internationally our margins are in excess of that and it's you know if you look at our domestic business I mean Joe we called out the letter argument to keep it simple every year and our domestic margins are obviously a lot higher and therefore a lot higher than single digits. Q  Unidentified Analyst Okay. And I encourage you to use the product and get a sense experience which is not a region prior to the consumer side in the marketplace. Joey Levin I think that's the mistake from our approach with some security advisor and Angie's List and on outline for service providers on call my visor. Oh that compares. Yes. Thank you. Q  Unidentified Analyst How are all the conversion compares to show it. Joey Levin That it's a very good question and difficult question because the - it's very easy to track home with. And it's more complicated to track it. And you live with the leasing model. It's something that we are looking into deeply. I mean we've made some estimates on that and we think that both platforms provide a very healthy our life for service professionals. And we know kind of exactly what that looks like on the home advisor side. And one of our very near term objectives is to understand better and prove what that looks like on the Angie's List. In the letter Q Does it does a great job in talking about our allies to us based on you know based on the way we're going to take Leighton the relationship there too. And you know we estimate your base are 3 to 4 per cent. That is to 29 times return on a dollar and spends with us that is to stamp in with pride. Q  Unidentified Analyst Great thanks for taking the questions. Joe we on the new leadership just give us an update on how you're viewing that and whether or not you're seeing yourself playing the role as CEO for the foreseeable future do you think that will at some point have a standalone CEO. And then secondly you also took the words you don't. I'm just wondering is there anything for us read on battery intentions to expand their relationship there. Joey Levin Sure. I definitely will not be in that role. Terry I will not be in that or ever to the - we went in a choice of. Glenn Schiffman Making some changes in organizing the strategy in which case with the sometime for any of those things. So for some bring somebody right away and let that person make all those changes. And we opted for the former and the latter pushed out the timeline a bit and we've been having this deal for a little while right now I'm going back to focus on finding the right person for the me also. So we are taking up that that searches to be on. A lovely man. Boy there's a lot of interest. I mean I know that a lot of interest in a lot of interest and very high quality people which is more in a position really to make a decision previously and now we're focused on doing that. Ruben there's absolutely nothing to read into that. From Chicago the Groupon offices are directly across the street from my parents apartment.  I've known the leadership of Groupon for a long time and of those guys and I think they have a big opportunity and so I thought I could go on to Chicago and I could also chip in a group identity of I could be helpful and that's all there is to the Groupon story. Operator, thank you, great. We can do one more thing. We got a lot of these people's time this week. Q  Unidentified Analyst Thank you. Excellent. Thanks. And we got to follow up on the acquisition question earlier so you know what sort of businesses would you contemplate point forward as a marketplace this is as big as it was. Glenn Schiffman I didn't return profile that you were looking for. Would you consider growth have to turn around businesses. And second I was intrigued with this discussion a hundred miles or so I'm just curious what specifically are you plan to take make sure acquisitions. The answer is all of the above you know. Where we look for opportunity not constrained by any of the sort of parameters that you listed. But will we consider any of those options on take rate. We got this a lot later the way you in the same grade as you increase our life for service professionals you make you get closer and closer to the transaction and you continue to prove that there they deliver value from the participating on the platform in the marketplace. So the better we do that and the more we deliver that the more we can make their job easier by taking work off their plate and putting it on our plate letting them then do the work they love to do which is whatever their particular trade is because we get there. I think the better we can do the take rate and the same thing when you look at other marketplaces that is that folks who have gotten to higher take rates you know delivered the closest thing to have are actual transactions or something much closer to an actual transaction. Joey Levin Thank you. Thank you. And I think that is. I appreciate all the time everyone is back with us this week. And it is a busy week. So we're grateful and we'll talk to you next quarter. Glenn Schiffman Thank you . Operator And that will conclude today's column. Thank you for your time. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Joey Levin I am. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And well take our first question from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Jason Helfstein Thanks. Kind of I guess two related and then one housekeeping. So first question how does HomeAdvisor being or soon to be a separate entity makes you think about the rest of IAC in your decisions around allocating capital with respect to the rest of the stub. Number two, what are the risks to integrate both businesses as you intend to hit your $270 million EBITDA target. And then just lastly, more of a housekeeping, I assume that stock comp will be a significant component for the senior management at Angie HomeAdvisor. Could you help us understand the dilution if Chris and his team are successful? Thanks. Joey Levin Sure. All good questions. On the rest of IAC and allocating capital, I don't think anything changes with this trend, I think you know will certainly start to focus more on the other businesses as kind of whenever we've done a transaction like this it highlights one business in a very specific unique way and then allow us to focus on the earlier stages, smaller businesses. So well in terms of attention, you know, well start focusing a lot of energy and attention on those businesses, but I don't think anything changes as it relates to capital allocation or any of the big sort of corporate organization capitalization decisions. The you know, we've got a great set of businesses still in that IAC seen out excluding both Match and HomeAdvisor, Video the kind of biggest most interesting - sorry not biggest, but biggest sort of long term potential we think but applications still a great consistent stable business and publishing with a really now I think now having stabilized potentially interesting future. So there's a bunch of you know where I say interesting call options in their advisee on the integration risk obviously feels like this deal for this deal of complexity. There are a lot of integration risk and there's things that we will discover that we can expect and all of that. When I think about this deal and we've done a lot of deals similar to this one. You know we have this one is pretty tight as it relates to the work we've done up in advance and exactly what we have to do and knowing what we have to do and how we do it. I don't think we would have been able to say that you know 18 months ago when we made the unsolicited offer aid and we were flying blind then but be homebuyer's it was in a different state then and we got a lot bigger target for rational network now. And we've gotten you know more things light on the products. I think we're in a very. Healthy place to be able to do something like that if you want to think about it in just the most conservative way. Jason which is not the way I think about it but you might think about it and just purely the most conservative way you think about the every list and is a very big affiliate for home advisor and you know how I think that audience that very brand conscious audience very specific highly qualified high quality audience. I think that audience will perform relative to say are we qualified affiliate or our best qualified affiliates. I imagine that it did meaningfully better than our best affiliate and we know how to deal with traffic like that offer that there is a huge amount of traffic that we think is kind of underutilized at any in the sense that they still haven't got the pay wall but that opened up a lot of opportunities. I think there's still opportunities to unlock in that transition. But if you say okay and get comfortable that the traffic is there and the that that - that other knows what to do with traffic like that and how to convert traffic like that in a way that is you know delivers a great consumer experience and delivers a great service professional experience that will open your service rational network absorb that kind of traffic. And we take a lot of comfort in the fact that we had two hundred million of unused cash last year in 2016. Now I don't know the traffic lined up perfectly with all that crap but I do think that that is the best. Give us a lot of comfort and kind of how we can handle that traffic. And on the cost side you know we've been looking at this for a while we've been studying this business for a while and we've dug in very deep with Angie's List and we've built this from the ground up and so I think we're reasonably confident and what we can deliver there. But like I said all of this has risk and all deals have risk and I am certain that notwithstanding everything I did said we were buying things we didn't expect. Jason Helfstein Both positive and negative. On StarCraft it's a great question. The there will be... Joey Levin Dilution for the management team for sure I get it is probably in a typical range growth 3 4 % something like that to the team. And you know that we see that that's over time and come into play over time but they will definitely quite deservedly have a nice piece of the company and be paid well. I think that answers your questions Jason The only thing is look in terms of execution of execution rest our confidence in our management team given what they've done over the last couple of years couldn't be better placed. Next question please Operator Thank you. We'll move to Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Brian Fitzgerald Thanks guys. A couple of questions on video. First we saw that you're shifting the video channel launch to. That's right. Can you provide more color there and maybe an updated plan around those initiatives. And then historically you shun advertising on DeMeo, but what would you consider maybe a 30 second pre-roll medrol [ph] in the future to further monetize content. You know you have some great longer form caught up there and we feel and I would absolutely be palatable at least from our perspective. Joey Levin On the shifting in the US but basically we hired a woman who is handling programming and a lot of Mayo who we think is fantastic she came in a few weeks into the job and my office and she said I can deliver you great content by the end of 17. But if I want to deliver you the best content I'm going to be delivering you that slate in 2018 for the 2018. And I said were let's go to that and we're not harassed until little will launch that in 2018 see that take down the law or reduces the law in 2017 in that business and everything else is going great video. And I think on paper in terms of building the technology and product that we need we're on a good pace there. And the creator math business is doing incredibly well and today and to accelerate growth in both bookings so that's all I think a strong positive. And the answer unfortunately is the same. We are not focused on and in this business right now. I think YouTube does a very nice job in Google and YouTube to a very nice job in that ad supported video product and that's just not our focus. I suppose that could change at some point. I don't think that's likely but I would never say never and we're always open to what makes sense for the business and our customers. And we will always think about it but I continue to say that's pretty unlikely. Brian Fitzgerald Thanks Joe. Operator Thank you. Mr. John Blackledge with Cowen. John Blackledge Thanks. Two questions kind of similar topic. First question. If you take iciest current share price back out it still can match back out our estimates Archdeacon Angie home services back out to net net cash to us it implies a negative cost a billion dollars which seems absurd. Joe Andrew Glenn question is kind of like what's your take you on the math and how do you solve this on your side. And then similar topic to Jason's question Joy. In a letter you mentioned you're going to continue to find build manage and grow great companies to come around compound capital for shareholders. Do you think you have another match it or homemade bombs simmering at and I see at the moment? Thanks. Joey Levin Thank you. Yeah I mean it's hard to have I think you're in the neighbourhood. I get blasted this morning and chuckle because that's always the case thinking of how I met with a celebrated analyst and I see right after we did the next IPO and he was saying well you know part of the story how we got there like the one we just you know do an IPO math and we are not today. Well what about that. Look, I mean it's something we have we have you know now the other company out of the one I see at some point I hope we get credit for a pattern here but maybe we never will. I don't know if I don't lose too much sleep over it. But the math is whatever the math is. I mean I think we argue every day having to prove ourselves on what the business is and what the potential is. And we're where there again I see. I mean we talk about this in the last letter on where we were in 2009 everyone thought we are losers in 2009 and you know we've turned that into quite a bit. I feel as confident now as we did that there is lots of potential in what remains we are so maybe surprised by things in there some of the things you know obviously been the it is probably the most interesting here but we're nowhere near. I mean that's a long time I think before we're in that position for mimeo. You know there's - we like to have a lot of optionality. John Blackledge I think we're in that position right now. Other than the portfolio what was it, I didn't grow up yet. Joey Levin No I think that that's that will be answered by then that too. John Blackledge I mean we obviously have a cat bounce and we'll look to deploy that capital and we'll never stop looking to the political that's the Operator Next move on to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Peter Stabler Well our security. Good morning. A couple on Angies and HomeAdvisor. First, with regard to kind of the differences between the models. Joe what makes you think that this list model still work. How do you look at it when you compare it to that data intensive lead gen model that buys or has these thoughts there? And then secondly the commentary around the 200 million unused - unless I've been asleep a possibility over the last couple years I haven't really heard that talked about in terms of home advisors having unused spend or under utilized spend on Access spend. So just wondering can you give a little more color there for investors what you're talking about. Is this is commentary we're going to hear regularly going forward is it going to be something that we can track etc.. Thanks so much. Joey Levin Sure. Let me do the second one first which is this is something that we looked at for forever. It's now when we talked about it because the you know your growing supply and demand at the same time in this marketplace. And so you're always kind of constrained by one or the other. And then it can go back and forth but there isn't. There hasn't been a moment where you for example have a monumental leap in demand and the transaction enabled they've had a monumental leap and demanded that you be a monumental demand and that news kept coming into play. The concept of the capital service vessels that I'm willing to do you know I'm willing to buy three hundred dollars worth of plumbing leads every month in one Double-O 1:04 and we may only have 200 dollars worth of f those leads, and so a hundred dollars goes unspent. Now that number will never go to zero because for example you know I use this one all the time but a snow plough company might have a large cap in the summer months of were left wanting to plough in there. We're not going to find a lot of demand in the summer for those snow plough companies. But when we look at the map there are a lot of demand that we think he can fulfil in sorry when we look at that supply and escape. I think there's a lot that we think we can't fulfil with demand that we're coming from that. I don't think that the number that we report on every quarter likely I don't think it's a - it's not the driver of the business. It is an opportunity when you think about this when you have these monumental leaps in demand on the question of does the listening model work. I think the answer is yes it works for some portion of the service professional population. There we think that is the sort of larger - please those folks have working with a lot of uncomfortable things model and like that. And we're going to continue to enable that for those customers. I think that that although we presume some declines in the listings model over time I think that realistically, what happens here is the consumer decides. And I think there is a consumer. We've talked about this a lot. There is a consumer who likes the list and the model or variations on the listing model which is to get a set of choices. And for the consumer to be able to make that choice I think that long term the consumer is less interested in making those choices themselves and more interested in the platform helping them choose and getting game master actually to take the action out of that process. But we'll see. We will work to enable the product to the consumers and we're going to let the consumers decide how they want to find the service professionals. But ultimately it's going to be the really the consumer's decision of the model when and if it's a $400 billion market in the US. And so there is a lot of products that can work in a 400 billion dollar market. A lot of customers and a lot of different ways of interacting and so will try and enable all of them. Appear on and use the stairs to do better. Jason's question a little bit earlier. We have our network is growing and our business is growing. The gap is growing. So that give us more confidence are around the synergies and a lot of evidence around the execution risk. You know that phone use cap ranks right up there. And you heard me say on Tuesday you know we don't get 100 % of our budget you know for espies so. Peter Stabler Thanks, guys Operator And next to Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Dan Salmon Hey guys good morning Joe. Maybe one on HomeAdvisor. One on video on home advisories and talking at length about the 400 billion dollar addressable market in the U.S. and in the letter you know you mentioned. You are seeing a similar figure in Europe. Could you maybe expand as you know the international footprint is largely focused there on North America and Europe right now but talk a little bit about what the long term opportunity may be in emerging markets as you build a little bit of scale. And then second if you could just expand a little bit more on what really I guess on its suggestion to delay launching the service into 2018 I'm just in no doubt to be in her team was with getting a slate up and running fairly quickly and so just simply having a little bit more time makes sense. But I'm just curious as to - is this about giving her chance to get through a full development cycle. Is there an opportunity you know for her to learn a little bit more about the community that you have there already. I would imagine engaging in some of your more prolific creators on the platform already would be a priority so just if you could take us a little layer deeper on that decision. Joey Levin Thanks. Sure. On the market in the rest of the world I think. So right now we only have exposure to North America and the US and Canada and I think five markets in Europe and it is I think that realistically for the near to medium term that's about a big enough footprint. That's a lot of work for us to do. And I don't want to spread too thin. It's hard to say I wouldn't eliminate the possibility that we may open up a new market either through the organically but I don't think it's likely just as we get ready. Dan Salmon But right now we look at America and Asia I think that some of the demographic information in Latin America doesn't really work for us or at least that it will just be a little bit more complicated right now. And you know you look at things like homeownership and against condominiums or apartments or rentals where they may be where a lot of work is done by the building super. Joey Levin You look at things like GDP and the middle class and all this and which kind of maps of the world. And I think we like our footprint right now. Dan Salmon There is a market certainly there are many more markets of course outside of Europe and North America. But I think right now we pick our battles and we're going to focus there and its market that rate up to a little over 300 billion of TAM just for sex. International markets we have. So far... Joey Levin And then on video and timing. Yes, absolutely spending time 14:00 spending time looking at our existing creator base. Speaking for this angry base out in the community understanding what people can make or decision making is all these things go into the equation. I don't think we have - we don't need to be on a typical schedule a typical development cycle. You know we don't have seasons and we don't have any of concepts that carry over from where we don't want are constrained by format time of year time of day any of these things. So it is open feel then and you know that on the one hand a incredible opportunity on the other hand is it's very a very you know located problem to think about in terms of where you want to focus. And we are and no one is spending a lot of time thinking about that. But we just now started to deploy capital. Dan Salmon And I think that 2018 looks good right now. Great. Operator Thank you. And on Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse Paul Bieber Good morning thanks for taking my questions. We're hoping you get some color in return the growth in the consumer part of the application and then give us an update on the rebranding of dot calm and the vertical content strategy what you're seeing in terms of traffic growth for the sites. Joey Levin Sure. Can you do on the on applications you call our longer about 64 % year over year? And we're also our business there grew as well. The partnership business as you know is in a slow decline. And then on our core market my Sparc business we just saw - from Q in the fourth quarter. We also have had some stronger BQ in the first quarter not as strong as the as in the fourth quarter and you see a guy you know in and around that 30 million is seasonally DRP. Q Is this a little weaker in the in the second quarter but we go great about that million. The third quarter in a row that this business has exceeded 30 million there. Again given the puts and takes the growth parts of the business we're in line more than making up for the shrinking base. Paul Bieber And I already forgot the second question. Oh yes we got that. This is really so far exceeded our expectations. I don't have a number that is going to be a number you can throw him out there based basically what happened here is we split it out of six different pieces the every single one of them that it launched I think it's now in traffic and certainly relative to line. But I believe even now you're over here right. Yeah. We have a nice fast growing new public here. And as the devil you read the weather do we pull that off and I think we and check that box that the next black flies do advertisers pay attention and do advertisers understand and get excited about it. Advertisers are meaningfully move still by comScore data and our comScore car for that looks pretty exceptional right now. And these are all new branded great content with new looks. And so we've got kind of a little puddle of hair here and a pretty face. I don't have the growth numbers. Joey Levin To put in context 90 % of our r sessions will now be in the verticals that will rise to 100 %. When we launched Savion May 15th we go through each of them very well. Q One sessions are up 10 % year over year. The balance of 80 % year over year life - 100 % year over year dis-proofs is up 100 % since last the last was very recent as you guys know in February. So we're not quite up a year there. And then Flocco is up 30 % since launch. So exciting numbers indeed. Paul Bieber Okay. Thank you. Joey Levin Sure. Operator And then move on to Kerry Rice with Needham & Company Kerry Rice Thank you. You don't want to put words in your mouth but it sounds now that you would be willing or maybe the opportunity for you guys to look for acquisitions may be increasing now with this spin out of home advisor maybe some comments on that. And then just kind of a housekeeping question. Other income was down quite considerably. I don't know if there's anything to call out from that or anything that you can give us to think about how we think about that line going forward. This is beyond the interest expenses other than seven point seven million going up there. Joey Levin Yeah. When do the other thing I will say if anything has changed. I say on a scale of 1 to 10 our appetite for acquisitions in general is 10. It has always been from prior history. You know obviously we can work on a big project. And so that's the - that's taking up a lot of our time and energy and energy. But that is you know we're always looking for acquisitions and that doesn't mean we rush into things we're very patient. We only go after things really on a high level of confidence but our desire to learn is always going to be as high as it could be I think that's central to what we do. You know the other is in the fourth quarter we had a $15 million gain from the sale price from the first quarter of 3:44 quarter of 16. We are about 35 million dollar gain in respect to the sale of Chubais by 16 with really high. The other thing that flows through there from an accounting perspective is fair game the net loss is in 16 games in either of the temporary basis the mortgage market and 70. We have significant losses there and then you know any trade later or early earnings and consolidate them and roll them off not based on the functional currency of that accounting unit that translates up there's an accounting an ethics game or an ethics law again from the county perspective. The big difference as I said earlier is after sales gains and losses through flow through their end 2016 with operationalised so far as we have price runner and issue about. Kerry Rice Is the Princeton Review sale in that bucket for Q1 or is that that falls into Q2. Joey Levin Actually in Q1. Kerry Rice Okay. Thank you. Operator Next I move on to [indiscernible] Q  Unidentified Analyst Great. Thank you guided to a 35 % margin for the combined adviser company is there. I'm just curious is there another lead generation company and a category that you're using as a guide they're just trying to connect the dots between that and the single digit or so margins that the companies have been posting for the teen years or so. And then if you could any update on the web. Joey Levin I know we've talked about this before. I don't consider it like a lead generation company I consider that a marketplace that matches consumers and home service professionals. We are not in the business of buying and selling leads. That's just a fundamental misunderstanding. So when you look at marketplace businesses yet you do see the marketplaces as they get those margins. Now I don't think we're in a rush to get to those margins as we said for a while but I do certainly believe bargains like that are possible. And we've been expanding the margins of the business recently as you've seen. And on that last page I think the answer is still the same which is this is not something we're spending time day about we think is absolutely without merit. We're going to fight it vigorously. And look I think you said Mark sorry if you say we can businesses that single digit margins. I mean we've already shown that even on a consolidated basis with our losses internationally our margins are in excess of that and it's you know if you look at our domestic business I mean Joe we called out the letter argument to keep it simple every year and our domestic margins are obviously a lot higher and therefore a lot higher than single digits. Q  Unidentified Analyst Okay. And I encourage you to use the product and get a sense experience which is not a region prior to the consumer side in the marketplace. Joey Levin I think that's the mistake from our approach with some security advisor and Angie's List and on outline for service providers on call my visor. Oh that compares. Yes. Thank you. Q  Unidentified Analyst How are all the conversion compares to show it. Joey Levin That it's a very good question and difficult question because the - it's very easy to track home with. And it's more complicated to track it. And you live with the leasing model. It's something that we are looking into deeply. I mean we've made some estimates on that and we think that both platforms provide a very healthy our life for service professionals. And we know kind of exactly what that looks like on the home advisor side. And one of our very near term objectives is to understand better and prove what that looks like on the Angie's List. In the letter Q Does it does a great job in talking about our allies to us based on you know based on the way we're going to take Leighton the relationship there too. And you know we estimate your base are 3 to 4 per cent. That is to 29 times return on a dollar and spends with us that is to stamp in with pride. Q  Unidentified Analyst Great thanks for taking the questions. Joe we on the new leadership just give us an update on how you're viewing that and whether or not you're seeing yourself playing the role as CEO for the foreseeable future do you think that will at some point have a standalone CEO. And then secondly you also took the words you don't. I'm just wondering is there anything for us read on battery intentions to expand their relationship there. Joey Levin Sure. I definitely will not be in that role. Terry I will not be in that or ever to the - we went in a choice of. Glenn Schiffman Making some changes in organizing the strategy in which case with the sometime for any of those things. So for some bring somebody right away and let that person make all those changes. And we opted for the former and the latter pushed out the timeline a bit and we've been having this deal for a little while right now I'm going back to focus on finding the right person for the me also. So we are taking up that that searches to be on. A lovely man. Boy there's a lot of interest. I mean I know that a lot of interest in a lot of interest and very high quality people which is more in a position really to make a decision previously and now we're focused on doing that. Ruben there's absolutely nothing to read into that. From Chicago the Groupon offices are directly across the street from my parents apartment.  I've known the leadership of Groupon for a long time and of those guys and I think they have a big opportunity and so I thought I could go on to Chicago and I could also chip in a group identity of I could be helpful and that's all there is to the Groupon story. Operator, thank you, great. We can do one more thing. We got a lot of these people's time this week. Q  Unidentified Analyst Thank you. Excellent. Thanks. And we got to follow up on the acquisition question earlier so you know what sort of businesses would you contemplate point forward as a marketplace this is as big as it was. Glenn Schiffman I didn't return profile that you were looking for. Would you consider growth have to turn around businesses. And second I was intrigued with this discussion a hundred miles or so I'm just curious what specifically are you plan to take make sure acquisitions. The answer is all of the above you know. Where we look for opportunity not constrained by any of the sort of parameters that you listed. But will we consider any of those options on take rate. We got this a lot later the way you in the same grade as you increase our life for service professionals you make you get closer and closer to the transaction and you continue to prove that there they deliver value from the participating on the platform in the marketplace. So the better we do that and the more we deliver that the more we can make their job easier by taking work off their plate and putting it on our plate letting them then do the work they love to do which is whatever their particular trade is because we get there. I think the better we can do the take rate and the same thing when you look at other marketplaces that is that folks who have gotten to higher take rates you know delivered the closest thing to have are actual transactions or something much closer to an actual transaction. Joey Levin Thank you. Thank you. And I think that is. I appreciate all the time everyone is back with us this week. And it is a busy week. So we're grateful and we'll talk to you next quarter.

Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Operator Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mark Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp. Thank you, Crystal, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they are available on our Investor Website intc.com. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today we'll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. And finally, I'd like to draw your attention to a change we've made to our guidance practices for the current quarter and full year. Beginning with today's earnings release for the first quarter of 2017, our business outlook will speak only as of the date of our quarterly earnings releases, bringing our practices in line with virtually all of our peers. With that, let me hand it over to Brian. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Thanks, Mark. The first quarter marked a great start to the year coming off both Q4 and full-year records in 2016. Q1 revenue was up 7% over the first quarter of last year, a record Q1. And operating margin was up 20%. It was another milestone in our transformation from a PC-centered company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. Average selling prices, or ASPs, grew meaningfully across our PC, data center and IoT business, reflecting the market's demand for performance and our segmentation strategy, and our memory business set an all-time record revenue. At our investor meeting in February, I outlined our strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I also detailed our top four priorities for the year: growing the data center and adjacencies, ensuring a strong and healthy PC business, growing IoT and devices, and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs. That's the framework we're using to measure our success throughout the year, and I'd like to take a few minutes to assess our progress so far. First the data center and its adjacencies. DCG grew 6% year over year despite a headwind resulting from a 14-week first quarter last year. The cloud service provider revenue was up 18%. The comms service provider segment was up 12%. And enterprise was down 3%, while non-CPU adjacencies grew more than 20% across all of the segments. Data center microprocessor ASPs were up in total across every product line, underscoring the market's demand for performance to transmit, aggregate and analyze data. We're also on track for mid-summer launch of our next-generation Skylake microprocessor. Skylake delivers significant performance gains across a wide range of workloads. For example, Skylake will include AVX-512 extensions that will deliver a 2x improvement in floating-point operations per clock over the current generation, a gain that will have an especially high impact on HPC and artificial intelligence workloads. And last month we announced the formation of the Artificial Intelligence Product Group, bringing together all of our AI hardware and software assets and all of our AI engineering expertise across the company into a single group to accelerate our development of a full stack of AI solutions, and explore novel approaches that will shape the next generation of AI products. Second, a strong and healthy Client business. Our annual cadence of product innovation, combined with a thoughtful segmentation strategy, continued to produce strong mix, which drove higher ASPs. This trend, along with our ramping modem business, drove revenue up 6% and operating margin up 60% over last year. Our expectations for the PC unit TAM haven't changed since we last talked with you. We're expecting a mid-single digit percentage decline in the unit TAM. Our ASPs, however, are trending ahead of expectations and are contributing to our slightly higher revenue expectations for the full year. Third, we highlighted the importance of growing the IoT business as we drive, and benefit from the rise of billions of smart and connected devices. IoTG revenue was up 11% year over year, where we saw strength in our industrial, video and automotive segments. We also announced our intention to acquire Mobileye, a highly profitable, fast-growing leader in computer vision for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. The transaction will combine Mobileye's expertise in computer vision with Intel's expertise in high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and connectivity. Together we expect to be the global leader in the $70 billion autonomous driving systems, data and services opportunity by accelerating auto industry innovation and delivering cloud-to-car solutions faster and at a lower cost. And, finally, we emphasized the execution in memory and FPGAs. Our memory business grew 55% year over year in a tight supply environment, while Fab 68, our Dalian factory, continues to ramp 3D NAND production and is delivering outstanding product yields. We also shipped our first Optane SSDs for the data center and our Optane memory solution, which is available online now and in PC OEM systems later this quarter. In our Programmable Solutions Group, revenue declined 7% over the last year after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges in the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decline was due to weakness in the data center and comm segment, partially offset by growth in industrial and auto and consumer. We also announced an important pilot program with Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, for our cloud-based FPGA acceleration service. We're making good progress against our four top priorities for the year and our transformation goals. We're improving the profitability and health of our PC business. At the same time, our investments in the data center, IoT, memory and FPGAs are paying off with significant combined revenue growth. These are purposeful investments that will position Intel for years to come. At the same time, we recognize that there is an opportunity and a responsibility to be more focused and efficient as a company, a goal we can achieve without compromising our most important investments, our transformation or our future. Focus was one of our objectives in establishing McAfee as an independent cyber-security company just weeks ago. And it is with efficiency in mind that we're making an important commitment to our owners today. We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue, which we expect to reach no later than 2020. Following a 1 percentage point improvement from 2015 to 2016, we forecasted additional 1 percentage point improvement in spending in 2017 and we're now expecting to do a little better than that. While we expect revenue growth to a play role in achieving these targets, hitting this goal will require spending discipline and an intense focus on our strategic priorities. To sum up the quarter, we're off to a good start and executing well against our priorities. We're delivering a steady cadence of leading products, a powerful segmentation strategy and growing profitability in our Client business. We're growing our Data Center, IoT, and Memory businesses as customers see data as a competitive advantage and look to Intel as a partner that can help them create, analyze and unlock the value of massive and growing flood of data. And finally, we are committing ourselves to a set of important new productivity goals intended to create value for our owners. With that I'll hand it over to Bob. Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Thanks, Brian. 2016 was a record year for Intel and 2017 is off to a strong start. We executed on several important milestones in the quarter. We delivered on innovative product and technology roadmaps across the business, Fab 68 in Dalian continued its impressive ramp, and Intel's transformation continued with the planned acquisition of Mobileye for autonomous driving and the sale of the Intel Security Group. Revenue was $14.8 billion, up 7% year over year. Operating income was $3.9 billion, up 20% year over year, and earnings per share of $0.66 was up 22% year over year. Our EPS performance was a result of strong top line growth and significant margin expansion. First quarter operating margin was 27%, up 3 points year over year, and gross margin came in at 63% up 0.5 points year over year. Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, flat year over year and down 2 points as a percent of revenue from 2016 as we continued to execute on our restructuring program. Let me touch briefly on our segment performance. The Client Computing Group had revenue of $8 billion, up 6% year over year. We continue to see the worldwide PC supply chain operate at healthy levels. Client ASPs were up 7% year over year as our segmentation strategies are paying off and core mix continues to be strong. This segment had yet another quarter of significant profit growth with operating profit growing over 60% from a year ago as the business continues to execute and benefit from continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit cost, richer product mix and lower spending, primarily from the Client business having a decreased share of technology development and SG&A allocations. The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.2 billion, up 6% year over year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.5 billion, down 16% year over year. Operating margin percent was impacted by increased allocation of technology development and SG&A costs, higher product costs as we transition to 14-nanometer and the ramp of adjacency products. Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $721 million, growing 11% year over year driven by strength in the industrial and video segments and continued momentum in our automotive business. Operating profit for the business was $105 million, down 15% year over year from increased investments in autonomous driving and increased allocation of SG&A and technology development spending. Our Memory business had record revenue of $866 million, up 55% year over year with strong demand for data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. We continue to make outstanding progress ramping Fab 68 with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectations. This segment had an operating loss of $129 million, largely driven by costs associated with 3D XPoint and startup costs for our memory capacity. The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million. Operating profit was $92 million, flat year over year after adjusting for acquisition related impacts. Our Intel Security Group business had revenue of $534 million and operating profit was $95 million. Consistent with our prior guidance the Intel Security transaction closed at the beginning of the second quarter. Let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and our progress. First, invest in our business, second, strategic acquisitions and third, return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In the quarter we generated $3.9 billion of cash from operations. We repurchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, increased the dividend by 5% and repurchased about $1.2 billion of stock. In addition, we generated approximately $400 million from the sale of some of our interests in ASML, which generated $235 million of pre-tax gains. At quarter end, cash other long-term investments was $23.7 billion, up $600 million. Total debt was $25.8 billion. Today we announced an increase in our share buyback authorization by $10 billion. Currently, we have approximately $15 billion authorization. We expect to continue to offset dilution from our stock-based programs and opportunistically reduce our outstanding share count over time. Now let me turn to guidance. First, some context. First, while we see strong momentum and Client ASPs contributing to slightly higher expectations of revenue for the year, we continue to take a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third party analysts. We feel great about our annual cadence of product innovations with new product launches planned this year including Skylake for data center, eighth generation core, 64-tier 3D NAND SSDs and further extensions to our Optane product line. Second, we continued to see strong demand signals in our memory business through the year and our Fab 68 in Dalian ramping to be able to supply higher demand levels. Third, the Data Center business has solid momentum with the mid-summer launch of our next-generation Skylake processor. And forth, as I indicated earlier, we completed the sale of the Intel Security Group. We expect to realize a pre-tax gain of approximately $375 million and a tax liability of approximately $850 million. This results in a GAAP tax rate of 39% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% in the second quarter. And last, as Brian talked about earlier, we are committed to increasing efficiency as a company and we are making an important commitment to our owners today. We expect to reduce our spending as a percent of revenue by 2 points from 2015 to 2017 and our plans are to continue to drive efficiencies in how we operate the business over time. We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue which we expect to reach no later than 2020. As a result, we are raising our full-year revenue guidance by $500 million to approximately $60 billion and our EPS guidance by $0.05 to approximately $2.85 per share. As we look to the second quarter of 2017, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.4 billion, up 11% year over year excluding Intel Security and up 6% including Intel Security. We expect operating margins to increase by 3 points year over year, gross margins to be up 1 point at approximately 63% and spending to be approximately $5.2 billion, flat year over year. We expect our spending as a percent of revenue to be down 2 points in the first half of the year versus last year, as we make solid progress in increasing efficiency in the company. We expect EPS to be approximately $0.68, up 15% year over year. We feel pretty good about where we are 90 days into our three-year journey. We exceeded our expectations for Q1 and increased our profit expectations for the full year. At the same time, we are investing in the future by expanding our TAM from $45 billion to $220 billion. We are already seeing an impact, with our growth-oriented businesses up double digits collectively as we continue to transform the company from a PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud. With that, let me turn it over to Mark. Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp. All right, think you, Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Crystal, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Our first questioner comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The line is open. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you for taking my question. Brian, I'm curious on the Data Center growth. The growth rate is now below 6% in Q1. Are you still committed to the high single digit growth rate for this year? What will drive it? Is it just some pause ahead of the broader launch of the Skylake servers? If you could just give us some more color about why the growth rate is below trend right now and what will help it get back to trend later in the year and over the next few years. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Sure, Vivek. So the simple answer is absolutely, we're still committed to the high single digit growth for the year. If you take a look at it, as Bob and I both mentioned in the call, when you take a look at Q1 comparatives, one, Q1 of last year was 14 weeks. This year it's a normal 13 weeks. So you add that one extra week; that's a couple of percent that you're competing against in a year-over-year basis. Secondly, Q1 tends to be our lowest quarter in general if you just look at our seasonality in the year for overall revenue and output and growth in the Data Center business. And so as we look out and we see, as you said, the ramp of Skylake in the second half, as we see the normal seasonality, we are absolutely committed to that high single digit growth rate for the rest of the year. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And as my follow-up, the very rich mix in PCs, ASPs were up very strongly. How sustainable is that? And are you seeing any effect of competition from AMD's product launches? Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Sure, I'll start. Bob, you may want to jump in. Each quarter we come in here and say we're a little concerned about the sustainability of those high ASPs, and we continue to have that, so we always forecast. If you take a look at what we've forecasted for the remainder of the year, we've forecasted a slight decline in ASPs as we move through the year. Now, that said, we're continuing to improve our road map. We're continuing to pull in products, and the demand for those high-end, high-performance products, from 2-in-1s, gaming, high-end workstations, continues to grow faster than we are even able to project. So right now we've forecasted a slight decline through the rest of the year, but we had strong demand for it in Q1. And we really believe that's a function of our products and our roadmap. From a competition standpoint, we're not seeing anything unusual right now as far as  there's always some level of competition in this market, and I'd tell you for Q1 and our forecast for Q2, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary from what we normally see. Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Yeah, the only thing I would add, Brian, is with the ASPs being a little bit stronger than we expected in the first quarter, as we mentioned, we expect full-year revenue to be up $0.5 billion, versus where we were 90 days ago, and I would say one of the contributors to that is how we saw ASP trend in the first quarter of the year. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, in terms of your targeted 30% OpEx ratio by 2020, would love to hear what kind of revenue assumptions you're making as part of hitting that. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Sure. So I'll start. First I thought it would be good to give you a little background, right, why do we come out and commit this now, and what's our thinking behind this? And part of it is we had good progress, brought down spending as a percent of revenue about 1% for 2016. We're a quarter in, and we're seeing good progress in our efforts along 2017 of taking it down another slightly more than 1% as we look at this year. And so we just really took a look at, do we think we can maintain that progress and continue to drive efficiencies while driving growth. The growth we've expected is what we talked about in the analyst meeting back in February, which is that mid-single digit type of growth for the overall company, and that's kind of where we're at from a growth perspective. And then the cost reduction and efficiencies are driving the rest of it. Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Yes. And I would just say that our focus is on growing the earnings performance for the company in the short, medium and long term. And what we laid out at Analyst Day, as Brian indicated, was over the next three years, low single digit growth, operating income growing faster than revenue and EPS growing faster than operating income. Against that, we're trying to obviously make revenue grow faster, continue to manage the efficiency in which we operate the company and drive strong earnings growth performance over the short, medium and long term. So the 30% target is consistent with kind of the three-year plan, and we know that there's opportunities for us to be more efficient as we go forward. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC That's very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, was hoping to take a look at Memory. And here would love to hear from you as to how we should think about layering in depreciation from Dalian this year next, and when you would expect to turn a profit on the operating margin line. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Yeah, on the depreciation, we kind of implied in our guidance really no change on our depreciation through the course of the year, and what that assumes is roughly $2.5 billion additional CapEx from Memory in the year. In terms of profitability for this year, when we talked to you at Analyst Day, Rob kind of laid out a plan where the core 3D NAND would be profitable in the second half of the year, but our losses for the business would still be roughly in line with where we were in 2016. And that was a function of really three things, good performance on 3D NAND, continuing to ramp Dalian and continuing to invest in our Optane product or 3D XPoint. So those dynamics have us breaking even for the core business in the second half of the year. We said that near the end of 2018 as a whole, the Memory business would be profitable. And to the first quarter, growth was stronger than we expected and performance out of our fab was even better than we expected. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp. Thanks, C.J. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the DCG growth and into your outlook in June, flat or slight growth overall. Is your expectations of the DCG would be similar to that? And then as you look out the whole year, you talked about cloud growth. I know tough compares, but 18%. Just curious, since you've been shipping early to these customers, what would be the timeframe that you would actually see some benefit from Skylake? Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Sure, so I'm not exactly sure I completely understood your slight growth. What we said is for DCG as a business, we're in the high single digits growth rate, so we're absolutely committing to that. We talked about the 6% in Q1 and how, as we go through the year, we'll continue to grow. From the standpoint we've been sampling Skylake to the cloud guys now for some period of time. In fact, back into the latter half of last year. But you really don't see the ramp of Skylake in volume at any of the customers, whether it be the cloud guys or the rest of the enterprise and networking and all until the second half. That's really when the volume kicks in on the server side, and that's absolutely what we had forecasted and there's no change in that forecast whatsoever. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks. And then maybe if I could just ask, and I know you don't break it out any more, but just your view on your modem product this year and next, and if you could also maybe opine about your foundry strategy and opportunities there. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Sure, I can start with the modem and Bob can talk about  I'm not going to break it out financially. Bob can talk about, jump on top of this. But for us on our modem, it continues to gain momentum. We've talked about our one large customer, but we continue to get other interest in it. We are on schedule to bring our next generation modem into production in customer qualifications this year and really looking out over time. We have the next several series of modems over the next few years from an LTE perspective. And then we're already working on and believe we're leading, if you looked at our output for the MWC back in February as well, on the 5G side which is both at the modem and back through the base station. And that, we believe, is really the differential that we're able to provide in the communication space is in a space like 5G where the modem and the base station and backhaul is so integrated and so important, we're able to provide that end-to-end solution. From a foundry perspective, we continue to talk to several large customers and as we're able to, we'll talk about volumes and launching of new products. But for right now we're just saying we're continuing to invest and grow that business. Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Yeah, and the only thing that I would add is the strong CCG revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. As you'll remember, because our first launch client really didn't ramp until the second half of last year, the first half revenue growth for CCG will, particularly because the modem will have a relatively easy comp. So that's a contributor to growth in the first half, and as Brian said, the comps get much tougher in the second half because our one client launched in the second half last year, but given the product we have, we feel relatively good about where we are. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein. Your line is open. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask again about this 30% spending target. You guys just had an Analyst Day like two months ago. It seems like something that probably should have been talked about then. So what's changed in the last two months that means you need to roll the target out on today's call? And how should I try to reconcile that target with some of your other commentary at the Analyst Day where you were fairly gung ho about the need to invest to find growth? Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. So I'll start, Stacy. I think you have to take a look at where we're at. You're kind of asking a couple of questions. So first, from the growth standpoint, our position about investing and continuing to really drive growth is absolutely still just as strong as it was back in February at the Analyst Day. And I'd tell you Q1 is a great example of that, with year over year growth, another record quarter, coming off a record year and raising the year and forecasting another record year. So I feel very good about the investments we've made, both short term, medium term and long term to drive that growth. That said, Bob and I have both been looking at, now how do we do that and also at the same time become more and more efficient. And what we've looked at now is that our performance and becoming more efficient in 2016 and taking about 1% out of our spending as a percent of revenue was very successful. We understand how we did that. As we looked at our first quarter performance and what we believe we can take out for the rest of 2017 is another percent of spending as a percent of revenue, slightly more actually. And then I think one of the things that Bob's really brought in as the CFO is new ways of thinking and new looks at how to continue that trend. And so taking a percent a year or so out of our spending as a percent of revenue is something we think we can go and accomplish while driving that growth. And that is effort that we've spent over the last couple months, really digging into those details. And that's why we felt like it was important we came out now and really said, yes, we are committing to that. We understand the details behind it and we've got a history now that tells us we can say it with confidence. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Got it. For my follow up, I'd like to ask about DCG margins. So they were 35% this quarter. It doesn't sound like there was anything structural like the warranty charge that hit last quarter. This sounds like the drivers around allocation and everything else that you've discussed. But it's still quite a bit lower than I think most would have expected. How should we think about that margin profile trending through the year as the Skylake parts ramp? And do you think for the full year, you'll actually be within the Data Center margin targets that you provided at the Analyst Day? Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Yes, I would, Stacy, we kind of provided a long-term outlook of 40% to 45% operating margin for DCG. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Long term. Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Our expectations for this year were for growth, as Brian indicated earlier, high single digit and at the lower end of that range of the 40% to 45%. In the first quarter, just to be clear, the 9 point drop in margins, 7 points of that is attributed to the fact that DCG is a bigger business, and we've indicated it'll be the first on 7-nanometer and a fast follow on 10-nanometer. As a result, it gets a bigger share of our technology development and our SG&A allocation. So 7 points of the 9% decline are simply a result of how we allocate cost to the business segments. I think in terms of going through the course of the year, the things that are going to change, as Brian indicated, we got strong product offering coming out in the second half of the year. We expect ASPs to improve as we go throughout the year. As you know, the first quarter is always the lower end of margins from a seasonal perspective. And we expect product costs to improve as we continue the transition from 22 to 14 nanometer. So it's in line with our long-term expectations. No change. Our outlook for 2017, no change. The biggest fundamental driver to margin performance is simply the success of the Data Center business in terms of growing, in terms of being a bigger chunk of the overall business, in terms of being a beneficiary of leading-edge technology. It bears 7 points impact because of the higher burden of our allocations on the business. So we feel good on where we are for the quarter and where we're positioned for the full year. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC But those allocation charges aren't going to go away anytime soon. It sounds like they're going to hang around for a while, if you're talking about 10 and then 7 nanometer. Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Yeah, that's true, and that's reflected in our 40% to 45% and our improvement throughout the course of the year. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you, guys. Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp. Thanks, Stacy. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bob, maybe just to follow on to Stacy's question, just some clarification around the allocation charges. The 7 points in March, does that represent a peak? Or do we run into a situation where as absolute costs for 7 and 10 go up throughout the year, you could see op margins in DCG continue to be down just because the percent doesn't change but the dollars are going up? Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Yeah, our expectation is the operating margins for DCG will improve by quarter throughout the year. Again, it will be a function of the normal seasonality of the profitability of the business. It will still bear a significant chunk of our tech development and SG&A costs, but you may remember that our development costs during the course of the year, as we indicated I think maybe last couple quarters, that comes down from first half to second half. So as that cost comes down, all of our businesses will benefit from lower costs. And then the third thing, the real fundamentals of the business are higher ASPs with good product with outstanding performance and getting better and better yields on our 14-nanometer product going through the fab will be benefits to the profitability of the business. The lowest point Q1 expectations will grow each quarter throughout the year, and we would expect full-year operating margins despite higher absorption, higher burden from our indirect costs at roughly 40% for the year. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC That clarification's helpful. And then, Brian, as my follow-up, one of the strengths of your model is just the free cash flow that you can generate, which enables you to reinvest organically back in the business. And you're clearly doing it this year on the CapEx front with CapEx up over 20% year over year. I guess what I'm trying to understand is, should we be thinking of CapEx this year as sort of the new norm with rising capital intensity, investments in the Memory business, maybe optionality around foundry? Or is the $12 billion this year sort of something that we should think about as being an above trend or particularly high spending year? Any color on that would be helpful. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Sure, John. I'd tell you that the increase in CapEx that you're seeing this year is something that we see as unique, but my guess is that we'll have to continue it for maybe one year more or so as we continue to build out that memory factory. But if you take a long-term view, I don't expect us to run these kinds of CapEx levels. We'll always make good investments, so in a place like this where we think we have differential technology like 3D NAND and our Optane/3D XPoint, I'm going to look for ways to invest that have a positive NPV. But from this current view, we probably have another year, and then probably go back down to what we'd consider a more normal rate. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thanks. Very helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea within Data Center of what revenues you're currently seeing from Xeon Phi? And also you mentioned acceleration services at Alibaba. Can you fill us in on any other key customers adopting Xeon Phi, FPGAs or any of your other accelerators? Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Sure. So we don't break out revenue on specific products like Phi, but Xeon Phi does continue to ramp and grow from a product standpoint. We have some additional products that will launch in the second half of this year around Xeon Phi from Knights Mill. And from an FPGA or other accelerators, we continue to get several of the large cloud providers, networking providers who are continuing to use our FPGAs. But again, we don't break out on a by-customer standpoint, but we still are committed to our 6% roughly growth on the PSG business this year. Q1 was down just because of some unique  there was some extra buying in the latter half of last year around some cloud, and the networking guys are typically down in the first quarter. So it hit its forecast, but it's down year over year. We think we'll recover that as we go through the rest of the year from an FPGA. And then as we go out through the second half of this year, the first of the products comes out in silicon from our Nervana acquisition which is another form of AI acceleration. We'll get that first silicon. We'll start to work with customers and you'll see that come in 2018 as an additional accelerator adding to our full AI portfolio. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC Thank you. I just wanted to clarify your answer to John's question. So in terms of the $300 million year over year burden on DCG operating margin that's due to the cost allocation, is that sort of a fixed number going forward? Or does that absolute number get better through the year? Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. There's two dynamics on our total pool of indirect costs that are going on for the company. One is our SG&A indirect costs are coming down. Brian referred to that earlier about the progress we've made on direct spending overall coming down another 1 point plus during the course of the year. And second, our R&D cost particularly as it relates to Moore's Law for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer goes up little bit. So during the course of the year, our overall cost will be roughly flat that we'll be allocating to the businesses. And DCG will get a larger portion of that than it has historically, roughly impacting the business by 7 points because of its bigger size and because of the decision to have it be a beneficiary of Moore's Law sooner than it has historically. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC Thank you. And then as a follow-up, so I just wanted to clarify, so the NSG, so you're expecting to still lose money into the first half of next year and is that what you're saying? Or you're saying that for the entirety of the year next year you'll be profitable. Thanks. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. So separate out again and remember we're making the large investments in Dalian, so from a pure 3D NAND perspective, we said it goes breakeven and beyond in the latter half of this year. So for next year, our standard NAND business will be profitable. 3D XPoint plus the Optane product is additional investments we're making. We said that that's in the second half of next year it goes to breakeven and the overall business does as well. We haven't gotten any more granular than that for right now. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC Thank you very much Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp. Operator, we have time for two more questions. Operator Thank you. And our next question will come from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Wanted to ask the first one on the OpEx side of things, and I applaud the 30% target. It's good to see that commitment, but I wanted to focus a little bit more on the near term. In the first quarter it was about $100 million above what you had guided and the second quarter is a bit above what I expected too, especially given McAfee. So could you give us a little color on why it was a little bit higher in the first quarter? And where we are in the restructuring benefits and the McAfee benefits, if you can do anything to size either of those in the near term, that would be helpful. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Yes, I think first quarter, a little bit over. I'd characterize it primarily in the round. I think for first half, we're basically implying $10.6 billion of OpEx and we're committed to our $20.5 billion for the full year. So $10.6 billion in first half drops to $9.9 billion in the second half and there's really two primary drivers to that. One is, as you alluded, the exit of McAfee will be roughly $300 million out from the first half run rate. And then secondly, just the completion of our previously announced restructuring programs will continue to bear fruit on lower OpEx in the second half of the year. So first half $10.6 billion, second half, $9.9 billion. McAfee exit, continued execution, and feel good about full year $20.5 billion. Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. And just a reminder, that $20.5 billion takes another roughly 1%, slightly more, out of our spending as a percent of revenue. So that's all baked in. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Great. Thanks for that detail. I guess my follow-up then switches to the gross margin side of things. It's staying solid, and I might be at the risk of a rounding error in this question as well. But considering that you raised your revenues and ASPs were a big portion of that, usually that's a pretty good follow through. So the fact that you're keeping the gross margin guide for the year flat at 63%, are there any incremental offsets to the goodness that the revenue and the ASPs would generate? Or is it, in fact, just rounding? Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. I don't know if it's rounding or not. I'd say $0.5 billion of revenue upside at kind of roughly gross margin dynamics of the business will fall through at an additional $0.05 of EPS, so we feel great about that. I think the dynamics of more the business is in the second half. ASPs will improve for Data Center. As Brian alluded earlier, we've assumed that ASPs will decline a little for the Client business. And the fast growth of Memory and modem will have a negative mix impact on gross margins. So I think when we take that altogether through the year, we felt a fairly consistent 63% with all those puts and takes throughout to the course of the year. And Q1 was where we expected, Q2 consistent with Q1 and full year. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp. Thanks, Ross. Operator, can you please go ahead and introduce our last question? Operator Thank you. And our final question comes from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel. Your line is open. Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Thank you for taking my question. Just on the capacity that you're building in Dalian, can you say what percentage increase you're getting? Or is it directly correlated to the revenue growth that you see in the Memory Group? Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Percentage. So, A, yes. The growth in the Memory business that goes through the rest of this year is largely driven by the ramp of the Dalian factory, along with some assumptions around strong ASPs as demand continues to outpace supply in the market in general. And so if you take a look from here on, in fact 2017, but then as we go out into 2018 beyond, Dalian will continue to be the driver of growth of that business. Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. I guess another way to phrase the question is, what's the bit growth? Most other memory companies give a projection of what their bit growth is. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Yes. I don't think we've actually ever given a bit growth, so that's not a public number. We can take a look at that for next quarter as to whether we want to start adding that to our normal distribution. But what we've always talked about is growth of the business from a profit or revenue standpoint and overall growth. Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Thank you. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Partly because remember, more and more of that business will become things like 3D XPoint slash Optane. And bits will be a little bit different there, right, not all bits are going to be created equal. That's a very differentiating technology. It's really got performance of DRAM-like devices with NAND non-volatility and pricing in between. And so those bits are a bit different than, say, typical NAND bits, and I wouldn't want to just lump those all into a standard number. So we need to think about how we'd really go and present this to you if you want to think about it from a bit standpoint. And that, it's around 5% of the business this year. But as you go out into next year and beyond, it becomes a larger and larger percentage as we see more and more products, especially in the data centers, use the Optane technology. Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Right. And maybe if I could ask that question too of Optane. When would it transfer to China? Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. We haven't talked about a transfer date to China yet. Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. So that hasn't been made public right now. Right now, Dalian is 3D NAND. Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Great. Thank you. Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp. Thanks, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us. Crystal, please go ahead and wrap up the call. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.

Our first questioner comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The line is open. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you for taking my question. Brian, I'm curious on the Data Center growth. The growth rate is now below 6% in Q1. Are you still committed to the high single digit growth rate for this year? What will drive it? Is it just some pause ahead of the broader launch of the Skylake servers? If you could just give us some more color about why the growth rate is below trend right now and what will help it get back to trend later in the year and over the next few years. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Sure, Vivek. So the simple answer is absolutely, we're still committed to the high single digit growth for the year. If you take a look at it, as Bob and I both mentioned in the call, when you take a look at Q1 comparatives, one, Q1 of last year was 14 weeks. This year it's a normal 13 weeks. So you add that one extra week; that's a couple of percent that you're competing against in a year-over-year basis. Secondly, Q1 tends to be our lowest quarter in general if you just look at our seasonality in the year for overall revenue and output and growth in the Data Center business. And so as we look out and we see, as you said, the ramp of Skylake in the second half, as we see the normal seasonality, we are absolutely committed to that high single digit growth rate for the rest of the year. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And as my follow-up, the very rich mix in PCs, ASPs were up very strongly. How sustainable is that? And are you seeing any effect of competition from AMD's product launches? Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Sure, I'll start. Bob, you may want to jump in. Each quarter we come in here and say we're a little concerned about the sustainability of those high ASPs, and we continue to have that, so we always forecast. If you take a look at what we've forecasted for the remainder of the year, we've forecasted a slight decline in ASPs as we move through the year. Now, that said, we're continuing to improve our road map. We're continuing to pull in products, and the demand for those high-end, high-performance products, from 2-in-1s, gaming, high-end workstations, continues to grow faster than we are even able to project. So right now we've forecasted a slight decline through the rest of the year, but we had strong demand for it in Q1. And we really believe that's a function of our products and our roadmap. From a competition standpoint, we're not seeing anything unusual right now as far as  there's always some level of competition in this market, and I'd tell you for Q1 and our forecast for Q2, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary from what we normally see. Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Yeah, the only thing I would add, Brian, is with the ASPs being a little bit stronger than we expected in the first quarter, as we mentioned, we expect full-year revenue to be up $0.5 billion, versus where we were 90 days ago, and I would say one of the contributors to that is how we saw ASP trend in the first quarter of the year. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, in terms of your targeted 30% OpEx ratio by 2020, would love to hear what kind of revenue assumptions you're making as part of hitting that. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Sure. So I'll start. First I thought it would be good to give you a little background, right, why do we come out and commit this now, and what's our thinking behind this? And part of it is we had good progress, brought down spending as a percent of revenue about 1% for 2016. We're a quarter in, and we're seeing good progress in our efforts along 2017 of taking it down another slightly more than 1% as we look at this year. And so we just really took a look at, do we think we can maintain that progress and continue to drive efficiencies while driving growth. The growth we've expected is what we talked about in the analyst meeting back in February, which is that mid-single digit type of growth for the overall company, and that's kind of where we're at from a growth perspective. And then the cost reduction and efficiencies are driving the rest of it. Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Yes. And I would just say that our focus is on growing the earnings performance for the company in the short, medium and long term. And what we laid out at Analyst Day, as Brian indicated, was over the next three years, low single digit growth, operating income growing faster than revenue and EPS growing faster than operating income. Against that, we're trying to obviously make revenue grow faster, continue to manage the efficiency in which we operate the company and drive strong earnings growth performance over the short, medium and long term. So the 30% target is consistent with kind of the three-year plan, and we know that there's opportunities for us to be more efficient as we go forward. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC That's very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, was hoping to take a look at Memory. And here would love to hear from you as to how we should think about layering in depreciation from Dalian this year next, and when you would expect to turn a profit on the operating margin line. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Yeah, on the depreciation, we kind of implied in our guidance really no change on our depreciation through the course of the year, and what that assumes is roughly $2.5 billion additional CapEx from Memory in the year. In terms of profitability for this year, when we talked to you at Analyst Day, Rob kind of laid out a plan where the core 3D NAND would be profitable in the second half of the year, but our losses for the business would still be roughly in line with where we were in 2016. And that was a function of really three things, good performance on 3D NAND, continuing to ramp Dalian and continuing to invest in our Optane product or 3D XPoint. So those dynamics have us breaking even for the core business in the second half of the year. We said that near the end of 2018 as a whole, the Memory business would be profitable. And to the first quarter, growth was stronger than we expected and performance out of our fab was even better than we expected. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp. Thanks, C.J. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the DCG growth and into your outlook in June, flat or slight growth overall. Is your expectations of the DCG would be similar to that? And then as you look out the whole year, you talked about cloud growth. I know tough compares, but 18%. Just curious, since you've been shipping early to these customers, what would be the timeframe that you would actually see some benefit from Skylake? Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Sure, so I'm not exactly sure I completely understood your slight growth. What we said is for DCG as a business, we're in the high single digits growth rate, so we're absolutely committing to that. We talked about the 6% in Q1 and how, as we go through the year, we'll continue to grow. From the standpoint we've been sampling Skylake to the cloud guys now for some period of time. In fact, back into the latter half of last year. But you really don't see the ramp of Skylake in volume at any of the customers, whether it be the cloud guys or the rest of the enterprise and networking and all until the second half. That's really when the volume kicks in on the server side, and that's absolutely what we had forecasted and there's no change in that forecast whatsoever. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks. And then maybe if I could just ask, and I know you don't break it out any more, but just your view on your modem product this year and next, and if you could also maybe opine about your foundry strategy and opportunities there. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Sure, I can start with the modem and Bob can talk about  I'm not going to break it out financially. Bob can talk about, jump on top of this. But for us on our modem, it continues to gain momentum. We've talked about our one large customer, but we continue to get other interest in it. We are on schedule to bring our next generation modem into production in customer qualifications this year and really looking out over time. We have the next several series of modems over the next few years from an LTE perspective. And then we're already working on and believe we're leading, if you looked at our output for the MWC back in February as well, on the 5G side which is both at the modem and back through the base station. And that, we believe, is really the differential that we're able to provide in the communication space is in a space like 5G where the modem and the base station and backhaul is so integrated and so important, we're able to provide that end-to-end solution. From a foundry perspective, we continue to talk to several large customers and as we're able to, we'll talk about volumes and launching of new products. But for right now we're just saying we're continuing to invest and grow that business. Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Yeah, and the only thing that I would add is the strong CCG revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. As you'll remember, because our first launch client really didn't ramp until the second half of last year, the first half revenue growth for CCG will, particularly because the modem will have a relatively easy comp. So that's a contributor to growth in the first half, and as Brian said, the comps get much tougher in the second half because our one client launched in the second half last year, but given the product we have, we feel relatively good about where we are. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein. Your line is open. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask again about this 30% spending target. You guys just had an Analyst Day like two months ago. It seems like something that probably should have been talked about then. So what's changed in the last two months that means you need to roll the target out on today's call? And how should I try to reconcile that target with some of your other commentary at the Analyst Day where you were fairly gung ho about the need to invest to find growth? Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. So I'll start, Stacy. I think you have to take a look at where we're at. You're kind of asking a couple of questions. So first, from the growth standpoint, our position about investing and continuing to really drive growth is absolutely still just as strong as it was back in February at the Analyst Day. And I'd tell you Q1 is a great example of that, with year over year growth, another record quarter, coming off a record year and raising the year and forecasting another record year. So I feel very good about the investments we've made, both short term, medium term and long term to drive that growth. That said, Bob and I have both been looking at, now how do we do that and also at the same time become more and more efficient. And what we've looked at now is that our performance and becoming more efficient in 2016 and taking about 1% out of our spending as a percent of revenue was very successful. We understand how we did that. As we looked at our first quarter performance and what we believe we can take out for the rest of 2017 is another percent of spending as a percent of revenue, slightly more actually. And then I think one of the things that Bob's really brought in as the CFO is new ways of thinking and new looks at how to continue that trend. And so taking a percent a year or so out of our spending as a percent of revenue is something we think we can go and accomplish while driving that growth. And that is effort that we've spent over the last couple months, really digging into those details. And that's why we felt like it was important we came out now and really said, yes, we are committing to that. We understand the details behind it and we've got a history now that tells us we can say it with confidence. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Got it. For my follow up, I'd like to ask about DCG margins. So they were 35% this quarter. It doesn't sound like there was anything structural like the warranty charge that hit last quarter. This sounds like the drivers around allocation and everything else that you've discussed. But it's still quite a bit lower than I think most would have expected. How should we think about that margin profile trending through the year as the Skylake parts ramp? And do you think for the full year, you'll actually be within the Data Center margin targets that you provided at the Analyst Day? Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Yes, I would, Stacy, we kind of provided a long-term outlook of 40% to 45% operating margin for DCG. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Long term. Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Our expectations for this year were for growth, as Brian indicated earlier, high single digit and at the lower end of that range of the 40% to 45%. In the first quarter, just to be clear, the 9 point drop in margins, 7 points of that is attributed to the fact that DCG is a bigger business, and we've indicated it'll be the first on 7-nanometer and a fast follow on 10-nanometer. As a result, it gets a bigger share of our technology development and our SG&A allocation. So 7 points of the 9% decline are simply a result of how we allocate cost to the business segments. I think in terms of going through the course of the year, the things that are going to change, as Brian indicated, we got strong product offering coming out in the second half of the year. We expect ASPs to improve as we go throughout the year. As you know, the first quarter is always the lower end of margins from a seasonal perspective. And we expect product costs to improve as we continue the transition from 22 to 14 nanometer. So it's in line with our long-term expectations. No change. Our outlook for 2017, no change. The biggest fundamental driver to margin performance is simply the success of the Data Center business in terms of growing, in terms of being a bigger chunk of the overall business, in terms of being a beneficiary of leading-edge technology. It bears 7 points impact because of the higher burden of our allocations on the business. So we feel good on where we are for the quarter and where we're positioned for the full year. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC But those allocation charges aren't going to go away anytime soon. It sounds like they're going to hang around for a while, if you're talking about 10 and then 7 nanometer. Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Yeah, that's true, and that's reflected in our 40% to 45% and our improvement throughout the course of the year. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you, guys. Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp. Thanks, Stacy. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bob, maybe just to follow on to Stacy's question, just some clarification around the allocation charges. The 7 points in March, does that represent a peak? Or do we run into a situation where as absolute costs for 7 and 10 go up throughout the year, you could see op margins in DCG continue to be down just because the percent doesn't change but the dollars are going up? Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. Yeah, our expectation is the operating margins for DCG will improve by quarter throughout the year. Again, it will be a function of the normal seasonality of the profitability of the business. It will still bear a significant chunk of our tech development and SG&A costs, but you may remember that our development costs during the course of the year, as we indicated I think maybe last couple quarters, that comes down from first half to second half. So as that cost comes down, all of our businesses will benefit from lower costs. And then the third thing, the real fundamentals of the business are higher ASPs with good product with outstanding performance and getting better and better yields on our 14-nanometer product going through the fab will be benefits to the profitability of the business. The lowest point Q1 expectations will grow each quarter throughout the year, and we would expect full-year operating margins despite higher absorption, higher burden from our indirect costs at roughly 40% for the year. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC That clarification's helpful. And then, Brian, as my follow-up, one of the strengths of your model is just the free cash flow that you can generate, which enables you to reinvest organically back in the business. And you're clearly doing it this year on the CapEx front with CapEx up over 20% year over year. I guess what I'm trying to understand is, should we be thinking of CapEx this year as sort of the new norm with rising capital intensity, investments in the Memory business, maybe optionality around foundry? Or is the $12 billion this year sort of something that we should think about as being an above trend or particularly high spending year? Any color on that would be helpful. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Sure, John. I'd tell you that the increase in CapEx that you're seeing this year is something that we see as unique, but my guess is that we'll have to continue it for maybe one year more or so as we continue to build out that memory factory. But if you take a long-term view, I don't expect us to run these kinds of CapEx levels. We'll always make good investments, so in a place like this where we think we have differential technology like 3D NAND and our Optane/3D XPoint, I'm going to look for ways to invest that have a positive NPV. But from this current view, we probably have another year, and then probably go back down to what we'd consider a more normal rate. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thanks. Very helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea within Data Center of what revenues you're currently seeing from Xeon Phi? And also you mentioned acceleration services at Alibaba. Can you fill us in on any other key customers adopting Xeon Phi, FPGAs or any of your other accelerators? Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Sure. So we don't break out revenue on specific products like Phi, but Xeon Phi does continue to ramp and grow from a product standpoint. We have some additional products that will launch in the second half of this year around Xeon Phi from Knights Mill. And from an FPGA or other accelerators, we continue to get several of the large cloud providers, networking providers who are continuing to use our FPGAs. But again, we don't break out on a by-customer standpoint, but we still are committed to our 6% roughly growth on the PSG business this year. Q1 was down just because of some unique  there was some extra buying in the latter half of last year around some cloud, and the networking guys are typically down in the first quarter. So it hit its forecast, but it's down year over year. We think we'll recover that as we go through the rest of the year from an FPGA. And then as we go out through the second half of this year, the first of the products comes out in silicon from our Nervana acquisition which is another form of AI acceleration. We'll get that first silicon. We'll start to work with customers and you'll see that come in 2018 as an additional accelerator adding to our full AI portfolio. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC Thank you. I just wanted to clarify your answer to John's question. So in terms of the $300 million year over year burden on DCG operating margin that's due to the cost allocation, is that sort of a fixed number going forward? Or does that absolute number get better through the year? Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. There's two dynamics on our total pool of indirect costs that are going on for the company. One is our SG&A indirect costs are coming down. Brian referred to that earlier about the progress we've made on direct spending overall coming down another 1 point plus during the course of the year. And second, our R&D cost particularly as it relates to Moore's Law for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer goes up little bit. So during the course of the year, our overall cost will be roughly flat that we'll be allocating to the businesses. And DCG will get a larger portion of that than it has historically, roughly impacting the business by 7 points because of its bigger size and because of the decision to have it be a beneficiary of Moore's Law sooner than it has historically. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC Thank you. And then as a follow-up, so I just wanted to clarify, so the NSG, so you're expecting to still lose money into the first half of next year and is that what you're saying? Or you're saying that for the entirety of the year next year you'll be profitable. Thanks. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. So separate out again and remember we're making the large investments in Dalian, so from a pure 3D NAND perspective, we said it goes breakeven and beyond in the latter half of this year. So for next year, our standard NAND business will be profitable. 3D XPoint plus the Optane product is additional investments we're making. We said that that's in the second half of next year it goes to breakeven and the overall business does as well. We haven't gotten any more granular than that for right now. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC Thank you very much Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp. Operator, we have time for two more questions. Operator Thank you. And our next question will come from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Wanted to ask the first one on the OpEx side of things, and I applaud the 30% target. It's good to see that commitment, but I wanted to focus a little bit more on the near term. In the first quarter it was about $100 million above what you had guided and the second quarter is a bit above what I expected too, especially given McAfee. So could you give us a little color on why it was a little bit higher in the first quarter? And where we are in the restructuring benefits and the McAfee benefits, if you can do anything to size either of those in the near term, that would be helpful. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Yes, I think first quarter, a little bit over. I'd characterize it primarily in the round. I think for first half, we're basically implying $10.6 billion of OpEx and we're committed to our $20.5 billion for the full year. So $10.6 billion in first half drops to $9.9 billion in the second half and there's really two primary drivers to that. One is, as you alluded, the exit of McAfee will be roughly $300 million out from the first half run rate. And then secondly, just the completion of our previously announced restructuring programs will continue to bear fruit on lower OpEx in the second half of the year. So first half $10.6 billion, second half, $9.9 billion. McAfee exit, continued execution, and feel good about full year $20.5 billion. Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. And just a reminder, that $20.5 billion takes another roughly 1%, slightly more, out of our spending as a percent of revenue. So that's all baked in. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Great. Thanks for that detail. I guess my follow-up then switches to the gross margin side of things. It's staying solid, and I might be at the risk of a rounding error in this question as well. But considering that you raised your revenues and ASPs were a big portion of that, usually that's a pretty good follow through. So the fact that you're keeping the gross margin guide for the year flat at 63%, are there any incremental offsets to the goodness that the revenue and the ASPs would generate? Or is it, in fact, just rounding? Robert H. Swan - Intel Corp. I don't know if it's rounding or not. I'd say $0.5 billion of revenue upside at kind of roughly gross margin dynamics of the business will fall through at an additional $0.05 of EPS, so we feel great about that. I think the dynamics of more the business is in the second half. ASPs will improve for Data Center. As Brian alluded earlier, we've assumed that ASPs will decline a little for the Client business. And the fast growth of Memory and modem will have a negative mix impact on gross margins. So I think when we take that altogether through the year, we felt a fairly consistent 63% with all those puts and takes throughout to the course of the year. And Q1 was where we expected, Q2 consistent with Q1 and full year. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp. Thanks, Ross. Operator, can you please go ahead and introduce our last question? Operator Thank you. And our final question comes from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel. Your line is open. Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Thank you for taking my question. Just on the capacity that you're building in Dalian, can you say what percentage increase you're getting? Or is it directly correlated to the revenue growth that you see in the Memory Group? Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Percentage. So, A, yes. The growth in the Memory business that goes through the rest of this year is largely driven by the ramp of the Dalian factory, along with some assumptions around strong ASPs as demand continues to outpace supply in the market in general. And so if you take a look from here on, in fact 2017, but then as we go out into 2018 beyond, Dalian will continue to be the driver of growth of that business. Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. I guess another way to phrase the question is, what's the bit growth? Most other memory companies give a projection of what their bit growth is. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Yes. I don't think we've actually ever given a bit growth, so that's not a public number. We can take a look at that for next quarter as to whether we want to start adding that to our normal distribution. But what we've always talked about is growth of the business from a profit or revenue standpoint and overall growth. Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Thank you. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. Partly because remember, more and more of that business will become things like 3D XPoint slash Optane. And bits will be a little bit different there, right, not all bits are going to be created equal. That's a very differentiating technology. It's really got performance of DRAM-like devices with NAND non-volatility and pricing in between. And so those bits are a bit different than, say, typical NAND bits, and I wouldn't want to just lump those all into a standard number. So we need to think about how we'd really go and present this to you if you want to think about it from a bit standpoint. And that, it's around 5% of the business this year. But as you go out into next year and beyond, it becomes a larger and larger percentage as we see more and more products, especially in the data centers, use the Optane technology. Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Right. And maybe if I could ask that question too of Optane. When would it transfer to China? Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. We haven't talked about a transfer date to China yet. Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. So that hasn't been made public right now. Right now, Dalian is 3D NAND. Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Great. Thank you. Mark H. Henninger - Intel Corp. Thanks, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us.
