Thank you, Tom. Welcome, everyone. Before getting into Starbucks' Q2 results, I thought I'd comment on a recent Wall Street Journal article noting that more retail stores have closed in the first quarter of calendar year 2017 than closed in all of 2016. And that more retail stores are expected to close in the U.S. this year than closed in any year during the Great Recession that began in 2008. The article illuminated once again the seismic shift in consumer behavior underway and the devastating impact that this sea change in behavior is having on many traditional brick and mortar retailers. Articles like this prompt three very important questions that I've repeatedly asked myself over the years and that I suppose many of you on today's call have asked as well. What are the critical, transformative components required to propel a brick and mortar retailer into the future? How do these transformative components relate to Starbucks? And what are the proof points? It is against this backdrop that I decided to open my first earnings call as Starbucks' CEO by sharing my perspective on what it's going to take for a brick and mortar retailer to survive in the future, and to explain how in the face of tremendous retail headwinds and cross currents underway, Starbucks continues to produce record financial and operating results quarter after quarter, and open a new class of over 2,000 stores around the world every year that continue to outperform both the immediate prior class and the industry overall, and deliver record AUVs and profit. Now, Howard understands this intuitively, our senior leadership team has been intimately engaged in the topic. As a company, we have a clear perspective on the answers. The critical transformative components required for any brick and mortar retailer to survive, let alone succeed in the future are an engaging, digital and mobile relationship with customers that is threaded into a branded, immersive, experiential retail destination. The attributes of the destination will vary. They may include theater, intrigue, or romance. But the common denominator will be the creation of a consumer experience that evokes human emotion and connection. I firmly believe that these are the ingredients that will determine which brick and mortar retailers thrive in the future, and which become victims of the current trend. The analogy from my years in the tech industry is how companies respond when a new disruptive technology, like cloud computing, for example, emerges. Those who recognize the disruption think long term and innovate for the future are the big winners. Those who don't, struggle. The retail industry is going through a period of similar profound disruption right before our eyes. These critical components are at the very core of Starbucks' business and investment strategies. To be sure, many of our investments will yield near term returns; others, longer term returns, but in all cases, they will further solidify Starbucks foundation as we build for future. Starbucks Coffee Company is playing the long game, and we are playing to win globally. Let me now share with you the evidence of our success in Q2 and why we are so optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2017. I'll start with four important and very encouraging headlines of today's call. U.S. comp sales accelerated through the quarter, culminating with a 4% comp in March. U.S. comps are further accelerating into April. Our newest class of retail stores continue to perform at record levels. And our business in China posted accelerating 7% comp sales growth, including 6% transaction growth. Accelerating comps and strong positive trends in our two largest markets sets up the narrative for FY 2017 as being the year of two halves. We're quite confident that we've turned the corner on U.S. comps, and that given the strength we are seeing in our U.S. business going into the second half and the beverage, food and digital innovation we will be rolling out over the next two quarters, that we will deliver on our mid-single digit comp target for the full year, despite the soft start in the first half. I want to be very transparent with you on our priorities, and explain how they relate to the two most important things for the future, digital relationships with customers, and branded experiential retail that are customer destinations. Our five priorities are focused on near term, as well as long-term growth. They include: One, continuing to accelerate comp sales and transaction growth in the U.S. Two, driving breakthroughs in food for the lunch day-part. Three, enabling long-term growth in China. Four, extending our digital flywheel assets; and five, elevating through the Starbucks Reserve brand. Each of these are powerful drivers of value creation that will once again provide us with outsized current returns while strengthening our business and positioning us to deliver sustained, profitable growth in the future. Let me start with an overview of our efforts to accelerate U.S. comp sales. We have several initiatives supporting this objective underway, including food and beverage innovation, strengthening and leveraging our digital and marketing capabilities, operational improvements, and improved in-store execution. You will recall that in Q1, we highlighted that 1,200 of our busiest U.S. company operated stores were experiencing 20% or more of their peak transactions coming from Mobile Order & Pay. The rapid adoption of Mobile Order & Pay and resulting demand increase was causing throughput challenges at peak in these stores. By the end of Q2, approximately 1,800 of our U.S. company operated stores were experiencing 20% or more of peak transactions from Mobile Order & Pay. Steps we have taken since the beginning of the calendar year to increase throughput have enabled to us to better and more efficiently handle increased demand from both Mobile Order & Pay and non-Mobile Order & Pay customers at peak. And we saw measurable progress in peak transaction throughput in Q2, as compared to Q1, in these busiest stores. As we enter Q3, Mobile Order & Pay continues to be a powerful driver of comp, revenue, and attach. And we are maintaining sharp focus on further increasing throughput. Our action plan includes three ways to unlock growth in all day-parts, and particularly at peak. Wave one actions have largely been completed and included additional training and reallocation of partner roles to Mobile Order & Pay during peak, testing of additional labor at peak in select stores, implementation of new approaches to order consolidation at the hand-off plane, and new tools and processes to support beverage and food production. These actions alone enabled quantifiable increases in both March and April, and improved the customer experience as evidenced by recent customer service scores. Wave two actions are now underway and involve the introduction of a new Digital Order Manager, or DOM. And the selective addition of labor in our busiest stores at peak based on the results of the wave one test. The DOM shows up as a tablet-based device that provides baristas with visibility on all incoming orders and enables better tracking and real-time order production management. It also enables a digital notification to a customer's mobile app when their order is ready, improving many dimensions of the customer experience, both in the app and in the store, while reducing congestion at the hand-off plane. We will be deploying DOM technology to our highest volume stores this quarter. But the DOM does more. As we deployed this high value, low cost technology across our store portfolio, we will create an extremely valuable source of new data insight around operations and customer experience. Data that will enable us to further optimize store operations, increase throughput, and elevate our customer experience. Wave three actions are being integrated into our existing store development and renovation approach. We are sharpening our focus on the selection and addition of in-store equipment and pursuing improvements in overall store layout and design, all with the goal of delivering a great customer experience and further increasing throughput. The actions we have taken to improve throughput are contributing to the acceleration we are seeing in sequential monthly U.S. comp sales now squarely back in the mid-single digit range. Looking to the future, this is all about how our digital relationships with customers intersect with experiential retail in our stores. We are confident that we're well on our way to further increasing overall store capacity while delivering enhanced Starbucks experience to our customers. Moving on to food. At our Investor Day in December, we highlighted the importance of food to our strategic growth agenda and are focused on driving breakthroughs in food for the lunch day-part. In many ways, this is about elevating experiential retail in Starbucks by providing a new customer offering in a relevant day-part and doing it well. Let me put the size of the Starbucks lunch opportunity into perspective for you. You may recall that we first began delivering significant growth in our food program several years ago when we up-leveled the quality and appeal of our bakery case with particular emphasis around breakfast sandwich innovation following the acquisition of La Boulange. Our strategic focus on the bakery case and breakfast sandwiches has paid off and is contributing to sales. In fact, in Q2, food represented 21% of our U.S. revenue and contributed 2 points of comp. We have demonstrated that by focusing on a specific day-part, we can create new customer occasions that add to the branded experience and become long-term drivers of growth. That is precisely what we are doing by up-leveling our lunch offering with the new fresh food concept we call Mercado. We launched Mercado in over 100 Starbucks stores in Chicago earlier this month. And though still in the early days, we are extremely encouraged by the customer response to Mercado. So much so that we are accelerating plans to deploy Mercado to a second market over the next two quarters. We view Mercado as an opportunity to provide our customers with a fresh, healthy and delicious lunch menu that we believe has the potential to drive increased traffic and attach, and ultimately help us achieve our long-term goal of 1 points to 2 points of U.S. comp growth from food once deployed across a significant portion of the Starbucks platform. We are very excited about our strategy and the opportunity to enable long-term growth in China, a country we first entered 18 years ago. Our business in China has never been stronger, nor have our aspirations ever been greater. We continue to open a new store in China roughly every 15 hours, a rate of new store growth that is likely to continue for decades to come. Increasing customer engagement and accelerating strength in Starbucks business in China once again demonstrates the global power of the Starbucks brand. Given the strength of our China business and the size of the opportunity, I've invited Belinda Wong, CEO of Starbucks China to join us on today's call from Shanghai to share insights into how we are continuing to drive our business in this very important growth market. Belinda, thank you for getting up so early, and welcome. Belinda Wong - Starbucks China Thank you. Thank you, Kevin. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that partner and customer enthusiasm for the Starbucks brand and the momentum in Starbucks China business have never been greater. Comps in Q2 accelerated to 7%, driven by a 6% increase in transactions. We saw growth in all categories and day-parts. Beverage, food and digital innovation are laser-focused on operational excellence, and targeted brand investments are attracting new customers into our stores and bringing existing customers in more often. Last December, we launched a strategic partnership with Tencent, including offering Tencent's popular WeChat Pay as a digital payment option in all of our stores. In its first quarter, WeChat Pay has already reached a remarkable 29% of tender, and has elevated the Starbucks experience for both customers and partners through its convenience and fast transaction speed. Following on that success in February this year, we've launched social gifting to unprecedented customer demand, partner excitement and social media interest. In only the first seven weeks after launch, over 1.2 million gifts were sent and over half have been redeemed by recipients in our stores. Our innovative new social gifting platform, we call it Say it with Starbucks, is not only encouraging everyday simple acts of kindness and connection, it is also bringing new customers into our stores to trial and enjoy the Starbucks experience. This is a great opportunity to further build new and authentic customer connections. We're only in the very early stages of social gifting in China and the growth opportunity ahead is enormous. We opened five new cities in Q2 and entered Q3 with 2,628 stores across 127 cities. Once again, our newest class of stores are delivering record transactions, AUVs and profits. We're also creating new Starbucks locations beyond our retail stores. In Q1, we launched Bottled Frappuccino, a new ready-to-drink beverage tailor-made to local customer taste preferences, and it is already available through more than 30,000 points of distribution. Since launch, we've tripled our RTD business and added 5 points of market share compared to Q2 last year. And we have many exciting new CPG products in the pipeline, including a delicious tea-based Frappuccino. Howard experienced Starbucks' accelerating momentum in China firsthand on a milestone trip he made to Beijing two weeks ago when we also held our fifth Annual Meeting of partners and families. At the meeting, we respectfully announced a new breakthrough partner benefit, critical illness insurance to parents of our partners, a benefit that is giving great joy to our partners and over 10,000 of their parents. I am so proud that we're setting a new precedent in China by helping our partners better take care of their aging parents. Our partners are our family, and it is important for us to also take care of our extended family. This is deeply rooted in our Chinese culture and values. We will continue to invest in our people and are committed to remaining one of the most admired brands and an employer of choice in China. Starbucks is building a different kind of company in China, a truly one-of-a-kind company, and we're doing it one cup at a time. And with the opening of our Shanghai Roastery in December, we will further elevate the brand and introduce our Shanghai customers and visitors from all across China and Asia-Pacific to an immersive ultra-premium coffee-forward experience currently available only one other place in the world – Seattle. We will continue to put our customers and partners at the heart of everything we do and to share our success. By doing so, we will continue to grow and to win, and to win with partners' pride in China now and in the future. Thank you. Now I'll pass the call back to Kevin. Kevin? Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Thank you, Belinda. As you can see, extending the digital flywheel is a powerful asset that is driving deep customer engagement and growth around the world. And we are very pleased with the results our digital flywheel made to our business in Q2. This is one of the two critical transformative elements for brick-and-mortar retailers of the future. A year ago, we made the strategic decision to transform our rewards program from a frequency-based to a spend-based program. Following this transition, we have seen solid growth in customer membership. We entered Q3 with 13.3 million active Starbucks Reward members in the U.S., up 11% year-on-year, and with 36% of total tender coming from Starbucks Rewards members. If you include sales from unregistered gift cards, a meaningful 44% of all transactions in the quarter were prepaid on our proprietary Starbucks payment platform. The program change positioned us well for investments in the next wave of priorities. One to one personalization, the ability for customers to earn stars outside of Starbucks stores, and additional social gifting partnerships around the world modeled after our phenomenally successful partnership with Tencent. The personalized Star Dashes and suggested selling are examples of how we are using personalization to provide a relevant customer experience and to increase engagement. Starbucks rewards spend per member accelerated through the quarter as both average transaction frequency and average ticket size grew for active members. This past quarter, we saw 8% growth, the highest growth rate in average spend per active rewards member over a prior year ever, reflecting both increased ticket and transaction frequency. We have line of sight to additional digital features that will drive sales growth in the quarters and years ahead, and you will see us continue to invest to extend our digit reach to more customers in new ways that are accretive to the Starbucks brand experience and that leverage our over 26,000 stores around the world. Finally, we are investing to elevate both our brand and our customer experience around coffee through our roasteries and the Starbucks Reserve brand. Starbucks Reserve is at the center of our innovation strategy around branded, experiential retail customer destinations. Complementing our first roastery in Seattle are additional roasteries now under construction in Shanghai, New York, Milan, and Tokyo. And a sixth in Chicago, announced only yesterday, will be underway soon. We continue to extend and solidify our global leadership around all things coffee. Our investment in roasteries and Reserve stores not only enable a world-class, ultra-premium, coffee-forward experience in flagship locations around the globe, it also establishes a core innovation center second to none that will feed innovation throughout our global fleet of Starbucks stores. As I said earlier, the retail industry is going through a period of disruption right before our eyes. We believe in the two transformative elements that will continue to propel Starbucks into the future, and we are allocating resources thoughtfully. As our second half U.S. comps and revenue growth accelerate, there are two priorities that will require modest increase in investment. First, we continue to see a rapid and significant return on investment by accelerating features of our digital flywheel. We have a strong roadmap of features to drive top-line growth, and accelerating those features will require incremental investment in second half. These are the right investments for our business and they will provide outsized returns. Second, we are investing against our long-term strategy to elevate the Starbucks brand through the design, construction, and introduction of five additional iconic ultra-premium Roasteries. As Belinda noted, our second Roastery in Shanghai will be opening later this year complimented by Starbucks Reserve stores around the world and the introduction of food inside Roasteries and Reserve stores through our partnership with Italian artisanal baker, Princi. Each of these is a smart, strategic investment that will pay dividends long into the future. (24:57) Finally, while the Teavana brand continues to be highly accretive to our tea business in Starbucks stores and is now being further leveraged with the introduction of Teavana branded ready-to-drink tea sold into CPG channels, many of our mall-based Teavana stores are continuing to have a negative impact on our overall result. We have launched a review process and intend to take clear action to improve the performance of our Teavana mall store portfolio. When you put all of this together, we remain focused on the critical transformative elements that will propel Starbucks into the future while maintaining a sharp focus on near-term value creation for our shareholders. These priorities are linked directly to the strategy we presented at the December Investor Day, and I believe will prove to be drivers of meaningful increases in shareholder value, both near and long term. Following Scott's comments on the financials, I've asked Howard to share a few thoughts before we transition to Q&A. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Scott? Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. As Kevin shared, Starbucks once again posted record quarterly revenues, operating income and EPS in Q2. Our business accelerated through the quarter and with the momentum we are seeing and the beverage, food and digital innovation we will be introducing, we are confident in the further acceleration through the second half of the year. Now at the midpoint of our fiscal year, we are better able to assess how our year-to-date performance, our investment plans, and overall macro factors will impact our full year expectations. Before getting into our fiscal 2017 outlook, I'd like to provide color on our second quarter performance. Consolidated revenues in the second quarter grew 6% to $5.3 billion. The largest contributor to revenue growth came from the 2,240 net new stores we opened over the past 12 months followed by 3% global comp growth, comprised of a 4% increase in average ticket and a 1% decline in traffic that after a 1% adjustment for transaction splitting, nets to flat traffic. Consolidated operating income in Q2 increased 8% year-over-year to $935 million, despite two points of impact resulting from recording certain prior period revenue adjustments in our channel development segment and one point of negative impact from foreign currency translation. Consolidated operating margin totaled 17.7% in Q2 on a GAAP basis and 17.9% on a non-GAAP basis, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Margin improvement in Q2 was driven primarily by sales leverage, partially offset by higher partner investments in the Americas. Both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS in Q2 grew 15% over prior year to $0.45 per share. Both measures are inclusive of a favorable $40 million impact in other income related to a gain on the sale of our investment in Square, Inc., our previous payment processor. Noteworthy is that the below the line gain on Square was largely offset by the $21 million impact of certain out-of-period accounting adjustments in channel development, as well as asset impairments related to our Teavana mall stores. I will discuss both of these items further in a few minutes. I'll now take you through our Q2 operating performance by segment. America's revenue in Q2 grew 8% year-over-year to $3.7 billion, driven primarily by 952 net new store openings over the past 12 months and 3% comp growth. America's delivered strong operating income of $826 million in Q2. Operating margin declined 130 basis points in the quarter to 22.2%, primarily due to increased investments in our U.S. store partners and higher cost of goods sold resulting from very strong food sales partially offset by sales leverage. Expanding a bit on food, we saw two points of comp from food in Q2, the most in four quarters driven entirely by attach. In fact, food attach in Q2 was the highest since we rolled out La Boulange three years ago. We saw continued momentum in our morning bakery and breakfast sandwich platforms, and strong positive customer response to our recently introduced Sous Vide egg bites. There were several contributors to the additional one point of Americas comp in Q2, the largest being continued success of our iced beverage platform with double digit growth across each of our espresso, coffee, Teavana tea, and Starbucks refreshers. And we are launching Frappuccino happy hour next week, with far more operational focus compared to last year, new beverage offerings, and the significant tailwind and customer excitement provided by the incredible Instagrammable success of last week's Unicorn Frappuccino. As we moved into summer, we will be launching revamped Easter boxes with an increased focus on protein and new Teavana iced teas. Let's move on to China/Asia-Pacific. Our CAP segment once again delivered a very strong quarter in Q2, with revenues up 13% over prior year to $769 million, driven by incremental revenues from over 1,000 net new store openings over the past 12 months and 3% comp sales growth. In addition to the accelerating momentum and continued strong performance from China that Belinda highlighted, Japan also delivered a very solid quarter, despite the adverse timing impact of a large annual New Year promotion that benefited Q1 rather than Q2 this year. Adjusted for this timing, CAP comps would have been a positive 4%. We're very pleased with our new store performance in CAP, and are seeing accelerating sales of Teavana branded teas in Starbucks stores across the region. Teavana is now available in all CAP markets with both Japan and China recording an over 40% increase in tea sales. Noteworthy is that we are creating momentum in our food program in Japan, aided by the success of recently launched pudding products and scones. Elsewhere in CAP, our licensed joint venture markets including East China and South Korea continue to make meaningful contributions to CAP's strong performance in Q2 as evidenced by a 35% increase in income from joint ventures. CAP's operating income on a GAAP basis grew a strong 36% over prior year to $176 million, with 380 basis points of margin expansion to 22.9%, the segment's highest Q2 margin since we made the Japan acquisition three years ago. On a non-GAAP basis, CAP's operating income increased by 33% to $190 million and operating margin expanded by 370 basis points to 24.7%. Contributing to CAP's margin expansion was the transition to a value-added tax structure in China and sales leverage. Let's turn to EMEA. Our strategy of repositioning our EMEA portfolio to a predominantly licensed model continues to drive margin expansion in the segment to a quarterly record of 12% in Q2, a 170 basis point increase over prior year. Of EMEA's nearly 2,800 total store count at the end of Q2, 82% were licensed up from 72% in the prior year. Total revenue in EMEA were $232 million in Q2, a 14% decline versus prior year. However, when normalized for the 20% impact of the transfer of our Germany business to a licensed partner, other portfolio shifts and foreign exchange, EMEA revenue grew 6%, driven by incremental revenues from over 300 net new stores added in the last 12 months. While reported comps in EMEA declined by 1% in Q2, overall system comps increased by 3%. Our system sales and adjusted revenue figures reflect the strength of the Starbucks brand in a region that continues to be significantly challenged and adversely impacted by economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Let's turn to channel development. As previously noted, we expected seasonality, particularly given the timing of the Easter holiday, to negatively impact Q2 revenue growth in our channel development segment. However, we also recorded an unfavorable revenue and operating income adjustment in Q2, primarily related to certain revenue deductions from prior quarters. This one-time adjustment impacted Q2 revenues by approximately $21 million and operating income by a similar amount, and was the principle reason behind flat segment revenue growth for the period. Excluding the adjustment, channel development revenue growth was approximately 5% and was in line with our expectations. Despite the adjustment, our domestic channel development business remains very strong and we gained approximate one point of market share in each of the K-Cup and Roast and Ground categories for the seventh consecutive quarter. We grew our K-Cup business by 4% during Q2, compared to zero growth for the K-Cup category overall, and now have an approximate 16% share of K-Cups. Within ready-to-drink our NACP partnership also gained share driven by our core Doubleshot and Frappuccino beverages. We began shipping Teavana ready-to-drink teas through our partnership with Anheuser-Busch InBev in February, with all four flavors already ranking in the top ten in the premium single serve ready-to-drink tea category in our active markets. On the international front we continue to grow our distribution of Starbucks Nespresso compatible capsules in the UK and France. Since launching the Nespresso compatible program last September, we have already shipped over 20 million units. In the UK, we have achieved 14% share and a number three market position. Channel development's operating income grew 6% in Q2 to $194 million and the segment delivered a 250 basis point improvement in operating margin to 42%. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our Teavana results and in particular the mall stores which are a major component of our all other segment. We currently operate approximately 350 Teavana mall stores and as Kevin mentioned over the last several years many mall based retailers have been adversely impacted by reduced foot traffic, resulting from the accelerating shift of consumer behavior away from brick and mortar retail and changes in consumer retail activity overall. Because Starbucks is a customer destination, profitability in our Starbucks mall store has largely been unaffected. But our Teavana mall stores have not been immune with many reporting negative comps and operating losses for some time. Since acquisition we've invested in new store designs and improved merchandising, but the rate of the decline coming through last holiday and into Q2 is worse than we had forecast and we are expecting further declines at a number of at-risk Teavana mall stores. Since the Teavana acquisition, we have recorded impairment charges and closed mall stores from time to time, but given these recent performance challenges, we recorded a larger impairment charge in Q2 related to certain of these assets. This impairment charge was the primary driver of the 12% increase in the all-other segments store operating expenses. We are currently evaluating strategic options for the at-risk portion of the Teavana mall store portfolio and will update you over the coming quarters as we set our course of action. It is important to note that we do have a meaningful subset of profitable Teavana mall stores. As a reminder, strategic reviews are not a new practice for us, and typically result in a stronger portfolio and increased profits in the long term as most recently evidenced by significantly improved performance in our EMEA portfolio. Our Teavana branded teas and handcrafted beverages in core Starbucks stores continue to outperform, and we continue to expect the Teavana tea platform – expand the Teavana tea platform through product innovation and new product offerings all around the world. Globally, in Q2, Teavana sales in Starbucks stores grew by almost 10% with even stronger performance in traditional tea drinking markets like China and Japan. Also, tea has driven a point of comp in the U.S. in virtually every quarter since we launched the brand in our Starbucks stores about three years ago. That's the investment case for Teavana, and the Teavana business remains very much intact. Let's move on to our 2017 targets and how we expect to finish the year. First, I want to reiterate that we expect stronger revenue growth in the second half, driven by mid-single digit comps including accelerating comps in our U.S. business. Revenue growth for the full year will be 8% to 10%, excluding approximately 2 points for the extra week in 2016 and 1 point for FX. But given performance in the first two quarters of the year, we are likely to be at the lower end of that range for the full year. We expect the back half of the year to be near the upper end of this range. EPS guidance is revised as follows. Full-year GAAP EPS in the range of $2.06 to $2.10 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.08 to $2.12. Third quarter GAAP EPS will be in the range of $0.54 to $0.55 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.56. This implies a broader range in the fourth quarter, with GAAP EPS of $0.56 to $0.59 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 to $0.60. I want to take a moment to explain both the change in total annual guidance and the wider Q4 range, and there are two main factors behind the changes. First, we see the opportunity to accelerate certain investments as we move through the balance of 2017. These investments are mainly in our Roastery Reserve and Princi businesses, including the ramping of our Roastery openings and increasing our spend related to digital opportunities, including in-store digital and investments related to personalization and Starbucks Rewards. Both of these areas are critical to sustaining growth over the long term. We now expect investments in 2017 for partner and digital to be over $250 million, accelerating as we enter the back half of the year and higher than our previous estimates. Second, as I mentioned earlier, underperforming Teavana mall stores will have a larger impact on earnings growth than we had originally forecast. I would further underscore that both ends of this EPS guidance range should be considered in your models. While we are confident regarding the second half top-line momentum, we will continue considering investing in opportunities that we believe will better position us to fully optimize our business and drive long-term shareholder value. For consolidated operating margin, we still expect a slight improvement on a 52-week basis compared to fiscal 2016. As promised last quarter, we want to separately discuss our core and innovation G&A growth. As a reminder, we have set our long-term target to grow total G&A below the rate of revenue growth and core G&A at half the rate of revenue growth. I'm pleased to announce that we achieved both objectives during Q2, and are on track to achieve this for the full year. Specifically, G&A as reported declined by 1%, but after adjusting for certain current and prior-year anomalies of approximately 6%, total G&A grew by about 5%. Core G&A, which comprises over 80% of the total was roughly flat, whilst innovation G&A increased significantly on an absolute percentage basis. Innovation G&A is comprised mainly of product R&D, digital innovation and certain costs related to Reserve, Roastery and Princi. We remain committed to managing the core growth rate while investing for the near and long term. For segment operating margins in fiscal 2017, we now expect Americas operating margin to be slightly lower year-over-year, CAP operating margins to show moderate expansion despite the negative impact of FX, EMEA operating margins to approach 15% for the full year and channel development to post strong operating margin improvement, with second half gains moderating from the strong first half performance. Looking at commodities and FX, our coffee needs for 2017 are almost fully price locked, and we expect commodities will be slightly unfavorable in the back half of the year. We also continue to expect an increased negative net impact from foreign exchange for the year, with revenue growth expected to be negatively impacted by about 1%, and earnings per share negatively impacted by 1 point to 2 points. The impact of FX will accelerate as we move into the last half of 2017. All other targets for fiscal year 2017 will remain the same. We remain confident in our strategy and the areas of investments that will drive our future financial results in the second half of 2017 and beyond. Our store partners around the globe continue to go above and beyond to deliver the Starbucks experience for our customers every day. And the performance from our two major markets, in particular, U.S. and China, each reflect and justify the increased investments we will make over the near term. Howard? Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp. Scott, thank you. Kevin, congratulations on your first call. I think you did really well. And, Belinda, coming from China in the middle of the night, I could not be more proud of you. And the story you told really came through in terms of the success and the bright future we have in China. My role on today's call and on all calls going forward is obviously different than in years past, with Kevin and the team leading the call. So my role today is really to be the unscripted closer to summarize what's been said, and I thought I'd do that through the lens of trying to put myself in your shoes, and that is the shoes of an investor. What did you hear today? What did I hear and what's my conclusion? I think there's a short-term issue and a long-term story. The short-term issue is, clearly in the first half of the year, we had compression and headwinds on comps and revenue. And as Scott and Kevin have covered, we feel very confident that we're going to see a significant change in both comps in the mid-single digits and revenue returning to historic levels in the second half of the year. You also heard from Belinda the success that we're enjoying in China. And unless you've seen it firsthand, you can't imagine the footprint we have in China, the opportunity we have and the growth and development of that market. And as I've said in the past and just having been there two weeks ago, there's no doubt in my mind that China is going to be bigger, stronger and more robust than any market in the world over time, including the U.S. Over the long term, you have to ask yourself a bigger question. And that is, given the seismic change in consumer behavior and how disruptive online shopping and mobile shopping has been to traditional bricks-and-mortar businesses and companies, who's going to survive and who's going to win? So I think there's two bifurcating questions. One in the short term, one in the long. The short-term question is, in terms of Starbucks U.S. business and comp growth, is the bloom off the rose? Is the glass half empty or half full? Now, I've been here almost 40 years. I've seen many cyclical changes in our core business. And I can tell you sitting here today, I have never been more confident that the comp growth that we have seen in the first half of the year, over time, beginning in the second half of the year and beyond, will be a distant memory. The pipeline for innovation, both in terms of product development, digital development, mobile development, and if you just look at what happened in the last two weeks, was something that was really probably the most stunning example of our understanding of digital and social media and Instagram, what happened with Unicorn, drove significant traffic, incrementality, awareness, brand affinity. And just stay tuned, because we have a lot more coming. So in the short term, the bifurcating question for you is, do you believe that U.S. comps are going to return and Starbucks' U.S. business is going to be as robust as it has been in the past? And I can tell you sitting here today, there's no doubt in my mind that the answer to that question is yes. Over the long term, I can tell you, as I've told you in the years past, that we anticipated and we saw very early on that there was going to be a very, very significant disruptive and almost cataclysmic change in the landscape of physical retailers. The number of store closures, consolidations, we're in the nascent stage of that. And there are going to be many, many losers. And the bifurcating question is, is Starbucks Coffee Company going to be one of the winners? What is it going to take to win? And, Kevin, I think, articulated that very clearly. One, every retailer that is going to win in this new environment must become an experiential destination. Your products and services for the most part cannot be available online and cannot be available on Amazon. In addition to that, what evidence do we have? Well, we're opening 2,000 stores a year. And here is another year at a time when there's so much pressure in the operating environment and we have another year, another consecutive year, of demonstrating best-of-class new performance in our U.S. stores. To me, personally, that is better evidence of the health and strength of the brand, unit economics and the relevancy of Starbucks stores in our existing comp number. In addition to that, you have to believe that in order to win and win big, domestically and globally in this new environment, that a company's capability and competency as a four-wall bricks and mortar retailer must be as good digitally and on mobile in all things that make the brand as relevant outside of the store and on a mobile device as it is inside the four walls of the store. We had a leadership position in our loyalty program in mobile payment, in Mobile Order & Pay, and I can tell you given what is in the pipeline in terms of the investments we're going to make over the long term and our ability to toggle back and forth between the physical and the digital world is only going to make our four wall retail business stronger in the future. So that the net result and the answer to these questions that I strongly believe, if I was an investor, if I was a shareholder, if I was analyzing Starbucks is, yes, we've had a tough first half of the year. We've got issues with Teavana, but that basically are diminutives when you look at the size and scale of Starbucks revenue and earnings power. We have the largest most important market in the world where we are already the leader with 2,600 stores and one opening up every day and our brand affinity second to none, and that's China. We have a national and global footprint now of over 26,000 stores, 90 million customers a week and still recognized as one of the most respected and recognized brands in the world. Starbucks Coffee Company is built to last. Starbucks Coffee Company is built to build a great and enduring company. And there's no question in our mind as we sit as a management team and as we address you today on the heels of a tough first half that our best days are in front of us. And for those of you who have covered the company for many, many years, who know me personally, I would not be here banging on the table and telling you how strongly I feel about the growth, development, and what we have in store in terms of the innovation of the company, both inside the four walls of our store, the building of the Reserve brand, the unbelievable experience, the roasteries, what's going to happen in all these cities. And one thing about the roastery that I should point out is that as strong as the roastery has been in Seattle, 20% comps, being profitable, it's not a city in which we can have the global halo that New York, Shanghai, Tokyo, Milan and Chicago will have when those roasteries open. It's a roastery that basically is catering to mostly local Seattle people and West Coast tourists. Wait till these roasteries open in these other markets. It's going to change the company. So net-net, those two bifurcating questions is Starbucks U.S. comps half empty or half full? Let me tell you, they're half full, not half empty. On the bifurcating question is Starbucks going to be one of those companies that is going to navigate through the unbelievable challenges that the bricks and mortar physical retailers are going to have, the question is undeniably, yes. We are going to be that company that is going to be the winner. So with that, that's my unscripted summary of how strongly I feel about the growth and development of the company, the leadership team, Kevin as our new CEO, and I thought again we told a great story today, especially Belinda in the middle of the night from China. So with that, I'll just turn it back to Kevin or the operator for Q&A. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Yes, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions, operator. Thank you, Howard. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Your first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Sara, your line is now open. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you very much. Yes, Scott, I would just like to ask about the earnings algorithm going forward, just in the sense, that at the analyst Investor Day four months or five months ago, there was a reiteration of that long-term growth. This year, obviously now expectation is lower because of investments. Does that mean that if we think about it longer term, that we should sort of rethink that earnings algorithm in terms of I think the double digit revenue growth, 15% to 20% EPS growth? And I guess on a related question, we've seen other companies, maybe use their balance sheet more aggressively. Again is that something that you contemplate doing in terms of just, again, going forward, thinking about the puts and takes, the top line, maybe a step up in just the normalized rate of investments? And then what margin for error your balance sheet offers? Thank you. Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. Thanks for the question, Sara. I think, the first thing I'll say is we are still reiterating our long-term guidance of 10% on the top line and 15% to 20% on the bottom line. To your point, we understand why the question is being asked and it's being asked a lot more frequently by the street given what's happened in the last two quarters where we haven't quite gotten to the low end of our revenue guidance. But I think as you look at the back half of the year and acceleration back up to 10% revenue growth, we remain confident in that being the fuel for 15% to 20% earnings guidance. And I think I'd also talk about every year as we set our long-term guidance, we go through our strategic planning process in the spring and we look at all of the drivers on the top line, all the things around innovation for product and digital, all the things we can do in the middle of the P&L to drive sales leverage, and cost of goods sold savings and G&A. We've been increasingly using the balance sheet and I'll come back to that to help a bit with earnings growth as well. And we ask ourselves, can we reiterate those long-term targets? And we're at the beginning of that process. Again, this spring, we'll go through it with our board over the next few weeks. If in that process we decide that the long-term growth targets have to be adjusted, then we'll come to you, we'll explain it to you, and we'll talk about why we're changing things. But as we sit today, we remain confident give than acceleration that we'll see those long-term goals still come into line. As it relates to the balance sheet, we have over the last three years taken long-term debt up pretty significantly. I think, we had $750 million a few years ago. We're up close to $4 billion now. And as you know, buybacks have increased pretty significantly over that time as well. And we'll continue to be opportunistic on the balance sheet. I think last second quarter, we bought back over $1 billion in stock. This second quarter, it was over $600 million, it's about a $1 billion in total cash return for the quarter. So we have been selectively adding leverage .We have been taking advantage of opportunities to buy the – buy our stock back and that will continue as we move forward. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John, your line is now open. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. Thank you very much. I'd like to follow-up on the growth rate question, if I may, but dig in a little bit deeper on the Americas. Obviously, the Americas is your biggest segment. At least the calculation that we did around the analyst day, it looked like the Americas needed to grow something like low to mid-teens a year for the next five years to contribute to your overall earnings growth algorithm. And yet in the first half of the year, operating income growth was around 2% with pressure on both the cost of goods sold line and occupancy, as well as operating expenses, in other words labor. So this – are comps enough, I guess, to change that? I mean, when we go from a 3% comp to a mid-single digit comp. Is that enough to begin to see leverage in that line, or are there perhaps other things that can happen in your business, lapping partner investments, running a more efficient store if that makes sense. Maybe some benefits from lower commodities or lower rents especially as other retailers vacate their properties, that can maybe give some more visibility of margin expansion in the Americas segment than what is currently apparent at this point? Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Yeah, I think, John, I'll start and then I'll maybe have John add to my comments. There's a couple of big drivers that are not evident in the P&L today. And the first one is top line comp growth. So the last couple quarters, we've been in that 3% comp growth rate, and that is a big impact on our ability to drive overall margin. I don't want to underestimate what a couple more points of comp would do for overall profit growth in the U.S. So being up in that high single digit to 10% range in total revenue growth in the U.S., that is a major driver of additional profitability. So, again, as we get into the back half of the year that should start to rectify itself. The second thing is the partner and digital investments we're making in the U.S. as a percentage of revenue, over the next few years that will start to decline. So we will continue to make investments but the reality is the rate of growth in those investments, the delta, if you will, that will start to come down and we'll be able to lever it as revenue growth increases. So that's not saying that wage investments are going to go down; rather they're going to go up. But if you look at this year, we went up $250 million for partner and digital investment, and the vast majority of that is in the U.S. That kind of impact on margin is not going to continue after we get out a couple more years. So both of those give us confidence in the growth algorithm. John, would you add anything? John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp. No. I would just add, John, that also what gives us confidence is the new store performance. And you look at new stores, it contributes over 4% of our top line revenue growth in the Americas. We've consistently done that for 12 consecutive quarters and we anticipate that that's going to continue. So we're making these partner investments up front, to Scott's point. We feel that those partner investments are the right thing to do and also at the same time, we're starting to see traction as it relates to not only partner satisfaction and we sequentially improved turnover by two points versus Q1 and also at the same time, our customer service scores sequentially improved from Q1 to Q2 as well. So, I feel very good about the investments that we've made and that, in fact, we're seeing payback from that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. John, your line is now open. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks very much. You talk a lot about retail environment and that's presumably the implication it's a headwind to your sales. But competition doesn't come up much on Starbucks calls. There is more and better places to get coffee today than there ever has been. And I understand roastery and Reserve is sort of a way of targeting that, but how do you think about the role competition is now playing in your sales trajectory today versus a year ago, let's say? Is that a contributing factor in your minds? And how would you close on that? Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Yeah, John, this is Kevin. I'll comment and then I'll ask Howard to comment on the view on roasteries and at the very high end. Look, we've always had competition, and typically, I look in markets where we've had a first mover advantage and we establish a presence of a number of stores and the Starbucks brand in those markets, that is a very defensible position. And if I look at where we're at in the United States and in China in our major markets, we are not – we not only have established a very defensible position, but we're expanding that with new store growth. In fact, let me have Matt comment a bit on thoughts on new store growth and how we're thinking about as we're building new Starbucks stores in our core brand, how that's helping us further strengthen that proposition in an environment where there is competition. There's always been competition. Matt, do you want to comment on that? Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp. Yes, domestically in the U.S., we have to look at this is not one market, but a collection of many markets. And as we look across geographies, we continue to see enormous headroom for store growth across the U.S. Just like we see differentials in store presence international to U.S., we see the same thing within the U.S. That means that there is a lot of opportunity for us to continue to expand in places where our strength has not been as traditionally great as it has been in certain urban and many western markets. So you're going to continue to see store growth, you know, ramp for us to grow into the future. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. And Howard, do you want to comment on the roasteries? Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp. I would say a few things. First of all, there's no evidence whatsoever that any national company, even those companies that are discounting coffee significantly, with McDonald's nationally or Dunkin' Donuts in New England, what Panera is trying to do, there's no evidence whatsoever that we have, that there is anything that they are doing that is affecting us adversely. So I just want to get that off the table. The competitive issues question is just a nonevent for us. I want to talk about the Roastery and Reserve brand, not through the lens of competition, but what you're going to have to do to win in the future. Every retailer is going to have to create an experiential moment, and if you're in the food and beverage business, you have to go to craft. You have to go to art. The interesting thing about the Roastery is, the average ticket to Roastery is $20. The average ticket in a Starbucks store is $5. People in the Roastery are spending significantly more time there than they do in the Starbucks store. The day-parts in the Roastery are afternoon and evening driven, which as you know is not Starbucks strong suit. The Reserve bars that we have opened are demonstrating enough interest from the customer and customers are trading up, which has given us even more understanding about the opportunity we have to elevate the Reserve brand in existing Starbucks stores. And when the first Reserve store opens in Chicago, I'm not talking about the roastery now, I'm talking about the Reserve store with Princi food, we'll have another – we'll more evidence about the opportunity we feel to grow those stores in ways that'll be highly complementary and bring a halo to the brand. But the short answer is the competition across the street, or the competition nationally and even those companies that significantly are discounting their coffee is not affecting Starbucks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. David, your line is now open. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hi, thanks. Your rewards and digital mix of sales is still growing nicely, 400 basis points or 500 basis points or so on a year-over-year basis. Looking at your active rewards membership, it's growing 11%. And that's maybe half the growth it was a little over a year ago. So it looks like that growth or the deceleration in your rewards member growth is correlating with your slowdown in sales. Do you think that that's an important metric? Is rewards member growth a key thing that you're looking at and targeting to reaccelerate in the future? And how are you going to do that? Thanks. Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp. Thank you, David. Matt Ryan here. When we look at the rewards program on the digital flywheel, we can't just focus on any one single metric. We have to look at the totality of its contribution to the business. And we're at a point right now where in the U.S., the digital flywheel has been the largest single driver of comp growth and we're very confident that's going to continue. And I think it's important to reiterate a couple of things that Kevin said. We have in fact seen 11% year-on-year growth in membership, but we have also seen record growth and spend per member. And when you take 13-point-some million members and you multiply it by an 8% increase year-on-year, that turns out to be one enormous number, and that's been a major contribution to our business. Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. And I would just add that's the power of personalization that Matt and his team have been driving. So taking that big installed member base and driving additional transactions via personalization. that's what's driving that spend, remember. And, David, if you go back a couple of years ago when we were adding a lot of members, the incremental spend per member was flattish. It might be up 1% or 2%, but this quarter it was up 8%. And so we see an opportunity to accelerate that over time. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Sharon, your line is now open. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC Hi. Good afternoon. I guess another maybe strategy question. Given the phenomenal response of customers to Mobile Order & Pay, have you rethought that hurdle of having people preload money in order to utilize it? Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Matt, do you want to take that? Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp. Yeah, Sharon. Matt Ryan here. It is one of the things we will be looking at as we look across the future. But I just want to remind that a theme that we reiterated at the Investor Conference, which is we continue to have a lot of people who join the program as soon as they become familiar with it, and our biggest barrier is familiarity with the program. So continuing to let that word get out there and help people understand what the program is all about is critical. In addition, we have an easy low-hanging fruit in front of us, which is to get people into the program once they begin the sign-up process. So you're going to continue to see a lot of improvement to the sign-on process and to the way in which we guide customers to go from where they are today, not being members, into being full members with the store value card loaded. And we see a lot of opportunity there in the short term. And we'll, of course, be looking at other options like the one you suggested, in the long term. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc. Great. Thank you very much. Just focusing on the comp topics for the company and I guess specifically for the U.S., it seems like that's the side of things that you guys are extremely confident on, the mid-single digit for the full-year fiscal year 2017. If we focus on just the U.S. for a moment, I mean, do the 3% comp in the fiscal second quarter we know the compare of these what looks like 300 basis points starting in this April through June quarter. So I'm just wondering, your confidence and then is it accelerating comps confidence beyond just the compares? Because, again, you would think that you would see that uptick just to keep the line steady. I'm just wondering what you characterize as maybe the most impactful new product or platform that you think in the back half is going to lead to a reacceleration in that two-year trend. And then, Scott, just to clarify. Did you say for the fiscal 2017 earnings that the range you gave was wider and that if you make incremental investments you'll come in at the lower end of the range? Or were you implying that you can make investments that might lead you below the low end of that newly revised range? Thanks. Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. So I think I'll have John and Kris talk... Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Let me just frame if first and I'll hand it over to John and Kris on this. Jeffrey, let me give you three things that I think in addition to – well, number one is the sequential acceleration that we saw throughout Q2, that has continued into April. The second thing is as we look at this quarter, the work the team has done around the Frappuccino launch that was kicked off by the Unicorn Frappucinno and what we've done to really make sure that we've got innovation and line of sight to how we're going to execute in the stores against that. And if you recall, a year ago we had the launch of the transition of the Rewards program at the same time. So we've been laser-focused on how we execute better in store with that. And then certainly, beyond that, there's been a great focus that Kris has placed on our partners in the stores connecting with customers and ensuring that we're getting that uptick in customer sat, and the work that Adam Brotman has been leading to increase the throughput at peak. So the increase of throughput at peak, the work that Kris has done in terms of customer connection, the innovation in the Frappuccino and the focus on in-store execution all contribute to the confidence, in addition to the sequential monthly acceleration we've seen in comps. And so maybe I'll have Kris touch upon a bit of what he's been driving in terms of store partner connection with customers. And Adam can touch a bit maybe on the Mobile Order & Pay. Kris? Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Well, Jeffrey, I think we've got a number of things that we teed up, especially coming into the next two quarters, around operations particularly. And obviously customer connection is the most important thing we do, be it through MOP or cafe customer or whoever it was. But the reason I look to Q3 as a big opportunity is a number of things. First of all, I just think we've just gotten started on MOP service improvements. And we talked about that a good deal last quarter. The things we put in place I know Adam will share in detail in a minute. But very, very confident that we've got huge opportunity in front of us around improving that service and making sure we get more people through the stores. I think secondarily, strengthen beverage and food innovation. As I look to Q3, Frappuccino Happy Hour is going to be a huge home run this year. As Kevin mentioned, we acknowledged that we underestimated the interdependence of those two things, the Frappuccino Happy Hour and the launch of the MSR, or the conversion MSR program last year. But we have got singular focus on Happy Hour this year. We've got this early spark with Unicorn out there that has really ignited, I think, interest in the product, in the platform. We're going to bring at least one new entirely new drink into Happy Hour this year that is going to be as good as Unicorn or better. And we've extended our hours this year on some other tactical things to really make sure that Happy Hour is set up for success. I look a little further out and I see some great products we're bringing in the back half of Q3 and into Q4. We've got an entirely new iced tea platform we're bringing into the stores that's going to be a winner. Cold coffee is on fire. Our core espresso platforms around cold coffee are some of our strongest growth we've seen over the last few weeks. And food. We've talked a lot about food today, but I think the food performance in Q2 is indicative of what we're going to see in Q3 and Q4. Everything from Sous Vide eggs to our core around breakfast sandwiches have been fantastic. We're going to bring a lot of innovation in core food over the next quarter, and I'm very confident that is going to help us lift comps significantly over the next few weeks. Adam, do you want to talk about MOP? Adam B. Brotman - Starbucks Corp. Yeah, Jeffrey. This is Adam. First of all, in general, we're in the process right now of making real improvements in throughput and capacity in general. So we've got good momentum there, specifically as it relates to Mobile Order & Pay, as Kevin mentioned in his remarks. The first wave of new operational actions we've already taken in this regard have landed well in the field. We're feeling really good about the results we've already seen, both in terms of improved throughput at peak, as we've mentioned, but as well as the customer experience in those stores around MOP in general for both Rewards customers and non-Rewards customers. We saw increased peak transactions in our busiest MOP stores. We saw the greatest improvement in customer experience scores for the quarter in the latest quarter in those busiest MOP stores, and that continues into April. And we're also really pleased with how we've been able to deploy partner labor against these throughput improvements, particularly in these busiest Mobile Order & Pay stores. It's a really important part of how I think we're getting smarter in terms of shifting or reallocating labor to the morning peak opportunities occasionally, and selectively investing in labor where it makes sense to do so and where we feel good about that. So net-net, we're really happy with the early momentum we have in terms of operational improvements around getting better at MOP experiences and just in general driving our business in this area. Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. And I'll wrap up your question, Jeffrey. So, no, we're not indicating risk below the low end of the range. But I do want to acknowledge that if we see opportunities for investment or if the Teavana mall stores perform a little worse than we have forecast, that lower end is entirely in play. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. David, your line is now open. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hi. Good afternoon. Scott, just on the guidance for this year, could you give a little bit of perspective on how much of the change was related to Teavana and how much of it was related to the investments you're making? And then I guess the second question related to that, assuming that the investments is a big part of this is why make that decision now? I mean, Starbucks has such a long history of delivering on their financial targets. I think the last time you lowered guidance was during the recession. So why now are you pulling forward investments and lowering the targets? Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. On the first part of your question, the larger piece is the investments we're making, although the Teavana mall store performance versus what we thought is meaningful. And to the second part of your question, David, I take the spirit of what – how it's asked. We see a significant opportunity in areas like digital and specifically what we see with returns on investments that we make around personalization, around things around Starbucks Rewards, things that we do in the app to make things easier for our customers. Those investments have the shortest payback and the highest returns of anything we do in Starbucks including new stores. And so as we look at the back half of the year and we look at the fact that we're driving the majority of our comps from digital, I would argue we must make those investments because those will pay off both as we exit 2017 and as we head into 2018, and I think, it would be not the right thing to do to skip those. So the second thing I would say is on Reserve and Roastery, those have longer term implications for us as Howard talked about, So making those investments now as we build the Princi capabilities. A lot of these capabilities are in the early phases, building out. The commissary capability for Princi Kitchens is building out. The roasteries that we have under construction across the globe and opening our first Reserve store soon, all of those things, needs the right level of design, the right level of merchandising, and it costs money to get those things setup right. The good news is as we move into 2018 and beyond, we'll start to leverage those investments as we begin to open more and more Reserve stores, open the roasteries, and we think that's the right thing to do. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. And I think this just reinforces the fact that we're playing the long game. And in this period where this dramatic disruption is taking place in the retail industry, we are very clear that the transformative elements that we're focused on are digital, mobile relationships with our customers and branded, experiential retail. And the investments we're putting in are in those areas. It's about elevating the digital flywheel and it's about elevating the brand with the investment we're making in roasteries and Reserve stores and Princi. It's all about the future. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is now open. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Yes, thanks. Just one quick one and then I've a bigger question. Scott, did you reiterate the mid-single digit global comp guidance for the year? I just wasn't quite clear on that. And then in terms of the personalization, I know you guys have been talking about that since kind of last fall. Can you maybe give us an update on how you think that's working and maybe what's left to do there? Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. So yes, mid-single digit comps globally for the full year, and I'll turn it to Matt for the second part of the question. Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp. Thank you for the question. We are very excited about personalization. And I would just reiterate what we've been saying and it remains absolutely true. We have only just begun. Right now, personalization, we did extend from email to the app about two quarters ago. We are seeing terrific results. It is the single biggest driver that we're seeing of the improved spend per member, and we just told you what that meant for us. So it's a big deal. We haven't done a lot of the things we dream about doing and one of the reasons why we continue to invest in technology is to be able to do those things. Triggered responses to events, triggered responses to external data that we can use, continuing to put personalization elsewhere throughout the app, and then eventually extending personalization to other screens beyond the app as well. These are all on the roadmap and will be coming and we believe they'll drive significant value for the company. So we're very, very optimistic and bullish on it. Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. Maybe just one proof point to add to what Matt said. As you know, we launched this quarter suggested selling across the platform within the app. So as you're ordering your beverage, we're able to show pictures of food and other things you've either ordered in the past, or would go well with items in your basket. And we saw this quarter the ticket on Mobile Order & Pay actually go higher than the average ticket on Starbucks Rewards orders that weren't through Mobile Order & Pay. That wasn't the case over the last year. So for the first quarter we've seen that tick above as we thought it would when we launched personalization. And that's a good sign. Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp. And just to add, we have also seen acceleration through the quarter with regard to personalization. So as we entered the quarter, and as we exited, we saw personalization as one of those things we think is going to continue to drive comps up in the second half of the year. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. And we saw higher attach on food in particular. Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp. That's right. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Which is the highest since we launched La Boulange three years ago. So clearly personalization is playing a role in that success. Operator The last question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is now open. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hey, another question on the sort of U.S. comp commentary. So stores that had those peak Mobile Order & Pay stores which were in 20% of transactions, you noted sequential improvement, but are we actually back to a point that those are positive year-over-year in traffic? And then when you're thinking about the improving into April, how much of that just relates to the disruption that we're lapping last year around Mobile Order & Pay or is that true on a two-year basis as well? Thanks. Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. So, Karen, those highest volume stores were slightly negative last quarter from a transaction standpoint, and they're still slightly negative. But that – but it's improved significantly quarter to quarter. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. It was pre-adjusted. (1:19:37) Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. Yeah. So we're seeing improvement, but still a little bit of negative transaction there. Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp. Can I just clarify one condition myself? I want to make sure there's clarity and common language, because I think the question was also is comp improvement based primarily on low comparisons. The answer is no, right? Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. So in both March and April we still had pretty big comparisons to lap over, so we're pretty happy with the overall comp growth and particularly transaction growth in April. Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp. Yeah. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. And I think our comp – well, our comp performance for the back half is based on the level of innovation that we're bringing in from a product standpoint, performance at happy hour as well as continued expansion of the digital flywheel. Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. Okay. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Great. Thank you, Karen. Thank you everybody. Tom? Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp. Yeah, thanks again for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter earnings call, which we have tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 27. Thanks again.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Your first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Sara, your line is now open. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you very much. Yes, Scott, I would just like to ask about the earnings algorithm going forward, just in the sense, that at the analyst Investor Day four months or five months ago, there was a reiteration of that long-term growth. This year, obviously now expectation is lower because of investments. Does that mean that if we think about it longer term, that we should sort of rethink that earnings algorithm in terms of I think the double digit revenue growth, 15% to 20% EPS growth? And I guess on a related question, we've seen other companies, maybe use their balance sheet more aggressively. Again is that something that you contemplate doing in terms of just, again, going forward, thinking about the puts and takes, the top line, maybe a step up in just the normalized rate of investments? And then what margin for error your balance sheet offers? Thank you. Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. Thanks for the question, Sara. I think, the first thing I'll say is we are still reiterating our long-term guidance of 10% on the top line and 15% to 20% on the bottom line. To your point, we understand why the question is being asked and it's being asked a lot more frequently by the street given what's happened in the last two quarters where we haven't quite gotten to the low end of our revenue guidance. But I think as you look at the back half of the year and acceleration back up to 10% revenue growth, we remain confident in that being the fuel for 15% to 20% earnings guidance. And I think I'd also talk about every year as we set our long-term guidance, we go through our strategic planning process in the spring and we look at all of the drivers on the top line, all the things around innovation for product and digital, all the things we can do in the middle of the P&L to drive sales leverage, and cost of goods sold savings and G&A. We've been increasingly using the balance sheet and I'll come back to that to help a bit with earnings growth as well. And we ask ourselves, can we reiterate those long-term targets? And we're at the beginning of that process. Again, this spring, we'll go through it with our board over the next few weeks. If in that process we decide that the long-term growth targets have to be adjusted, then we'll come to you, we'll explain it to you, and we'll talk about why we're changing things. But as we sit today, we remain confident give than acceleration that we'll see those long-term goals still come into line. As it relates to the balance sheet, we have over the last three years taken long-term debt up pretty significantly. I think, we had $750 million a few years ago. We're up close to $4 billion now. And as you know, buybacks have increased pretty significantly over that time as well. And we'll continue to be opportunistic on the balance sheet. I think last second quarter, we bought back over $1 billion in stock. This second quarter, it was over $600 million, it's about a $1 billion in total cash return for the quarter. So we have been selectively adding leverage .We have been taking advantage of opportunities to buy the – buy our stock back and that will continue as we move forward. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John, your line is now open. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. Thank you very much. I'd like to follow-up on the growth rate question, if I may, but dig in a little bit deeper on the Americas. Obviously, the Americas is your biggest segment. At least the calculation that we did around the analyst day, it looked like the Americas needed to grow something like low to mid-teens a year for the next five years to contribute to your overall earnings growth algorithm. And yet in the first half of the year, operating income growth was around 2% with pressure on both the cost of goods sold line and occupancy, as well as operating expenses, in other words labor. So this – are comps enough, I guess, to change that? I mean, when we go from a 3% comp to a mid-single digit comp. Is that enough to begin to see leverage in that line, or are there perhaps other things that can happen in your business, lapping partner investments, running a more efficient store if that makes sense. Maybe some benefits from lower commodities or lower rents especially as other retailers vacate their properties, that can maybe give some more visibility of margin expansion in the Americas segment than what is currently apparent at this point? Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Yeah, I think, John, I'll start and then I'll maybe have John add to my comments. There's a couple of big drivers that are not evident in the P&L today. And the first one is top line comp growth. So the last couple quarters, we've been in that 3% comp growth rate, and that is a big impact on our ability to drive overall margin. I don't want to underestimate what a couple more points of comp would do for overall profit growth in the U.S. So being up in that high single digit to 10% range in total revenue growth in the U.S., that is a major driver of additional profitability. So, again, as we get into the back half of the year that should start to rectify itself. The second thing is the partner and digital investments we're making in the U.S. as a percentage of revenue, over the next few years that will start to decline. So we will continue to make investments but the reality is the rate of growth in those investments, the delta, if you will, that will start to come down and we'll be able to lever it as revenue growth increases. So that's not saying that wage investments are going to go down; rather they're going to go up. But if you look at this year, we went up $250 million for partner and digital investment, and the vast majority of that is in the U.S. That kind of impact on margin is not going to continue after we get out a couple more years. So both of those give us confidence in the growth algorithm. John, would you add anything? John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp. No. I would just add, John, that also what gives us confidence is the new store performance. And you look at new stores, it contributes over 4% of our top line revenue growth in the Americas. We've consistently done that for 12 consecutive quarters and we anticipate that that's going to continue. So we're making these partner investments up front, to Scott's point. We feel that those partner investments are the right thing to do and also at the same time, we're starting to see traction as it relates to not only partner satisfaction and we sequentially improved turnover by two points versus Q1 and also at the same time, our customer service scores sequentially improved from Q1 to Q2 as well. So, I feel very good about the investments that we've made and that, in fact, we're seeing payback from that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. John, your line is now open. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks very much. You talk a lot about retail environment and that's presumably the implication it's a headwind to your sales. But competition doesn't come up much on Starbucks calls. There is more and better places to get coffee today than there ever has been. And I understand roastery and Reserve is sort of a way of targeting that, but how do you think about the role competition is now playing in your sales trajectory today versus a year ago, let's say? Is that a contributing factor in your minds? And how would you close on that? Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Yeah, John, this is Kevin. I'll comment and then I'll ask Howard to comment on the view on roasteries and at the very high end. Look, we've always had competition, and typically, I look in markets where we've had a first mover advantage and we establish a presence of a number of stores and the Starbucks brand in those markets, that is a very defensible position. And if I look at where we're at in the United States and in China in our major markets, we are not – we not only have established a very defensible position, but we're expanding that with new store growth. In fact, let me have Matt comment a bit on thoughts on new store growth and how we're thinking about as we're building new Starbucks stores in our core brand, how that's helping us further strengthen that proposition in an environment where there is competition. There's always been competition. Matt, do you want to comment on that? Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp. Yes, domestically in the U.S., we have to look at this is not one market, but a collection of many markets. And as we look across geographies, we continue to see enormous headroom for store growth across the U.S. Just like we see differentials in store presence international to U.S., we see the same thing within the U.S. That means that there is a lot of opportunity for us to continue to expand in places where our strength has not been as traditionally great as it has been in certain urban and many western markets. So you're going to continue to see store growth, you know, ramp for us to grow into the future. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. And Howard, do you want to comment on the roasteries? Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp. I would say a few things. First of all, there's no evidence whatsoever that any national company, even those companies that are discounting coffee significantly, with McDonald's nationally or Dunkin' Donuts in New England, what Panera is trying to do, there's no evidence whatsoever that we have, that there is anything that they are doing that is affecting us adversely. So I just want to get that off the table. The competitive issues question is just a nonevent for us. I want to talk about the Roastery and Reserve brand, not through the lens of competition, but what you're going to have to do to win in the future. Every retailer is going to have to create an experiential moment, and if you're in the food and beverage business, you have to go to craft. You have to go to art. The interesting thing about the Roastery is, the average ticket to Roastery is $20. The average ticket in a Starbucks store is $5. People in the Roastery are spending significantly more time there than they do in the Starbucks store. The day-parts in the Roastery are afternoon and evening driven, which as you know is not Starbucks strong suit. The Reserve bars that we have opened are demonstrating enough interest from the customer and customers are trading up, which has given us even more understanding about the opportunity we have to elevate the Reserve brand in existing Starbucks stores. And when the first Reserve store opens in Chicago, I'm not talking about the roastery now, I'm talking about the Reserve store with Princi food, we'll have another – we'll more evidence about the opportunity we feel to grow those stores in ways that'll be highly complementary and bring a halo to the brand. But the short answer is the competition across the street, or the competition nationally and even those companies that significantly are discounting their coffee is not affecting Starbucks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. David, your line is now open. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hi, thanks. Your rewards and digital mix of sales is still growing nicely, 400 basis points or 500 basis points or so on a year-over-year basis. Looking at your active rewards membership, it's growing 11%. And that's maybe half the growth it was a little over a year ago. So it looks like that growth or the deceleration in your rewards member growth is correlating with your slowdown in sales. Do you think that that's an important metric? Is rewards member growth a key thing that you're looking at and targeting to reaccelerate in the future? And how are you going to do that? Thanks. Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp. Thank you, David. Matt Ryan here. When we look at the rewards program on the digital flywheel, we can't just focus on any one single metric. We have to look at the totality of its contribution to the business. And we're at a point right now where in the U.S., the digital flywheel has been the largest single driver of comp growth and we're very confident that's going to continue. And I think it's important to reiterate a couple of things that Kevin said. We have in fact seen 11% year-on-year growth in membership, but we have also seen record growth and spend per member. And when you take 13-point-some million members and you multiply it by an 8% increase year-on-year, that turns out to be one enormous number, and that's been a major contribution to our business. Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. And I would just add that's the power of personalization that Matt and his team have been driving. So taking that big installed member base and driving additional transactions via personalization. that's what's driving that spend, remember. And, David, if you go back a couple of years ago when we were adding a lot of members, the incremental spend per member was flattish. It might be up 1% or 2%, but this quarter it was up 8%. And so we see an opportunity to accelerate that over time. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Sharon, your line is now open. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC Hi. Good afternoon. I guess another maybe strategy question. Given the phenomenal response of customers to Mobile Order & Pay, have you rethought that hurdle of having people preload money in order to utilize it? Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Matt, do you want to take that? Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp. Yeah, Sharon. Matt Ryan here. It is one of the things we will be looking at as we look across the future. But I just want to remind that a theme that we reiterated at the Investor Conference, which is we continue to have a lot of people who join the program as soon as they become familiar with it, and our biggest barrier is familiarity with the program. So continuing to let that word get out there and help people understand what the program is all about is critical. In addition, we have an easy low-hanging fruit in front of us, which is to get people into the program once they begin the sign-up process. So you're going to continue to see a lot of improvement to the sign-on process and to the way in which we guide customers to go from where they are today, not being members, into being full members with the store value card loaded. And we see a lot of opportunity there in the short term. And we'll, of course, be looking at other options like the one you suggested, in the long term. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc. Great. Thank you very much. Just focusing on the comp topics for the company and I guess specifically for the U.S., it seems like that's the side of things that you guys are extremely confident on, the mid-single digit for the full-year fiscal year 2017. If we focus on just the U.S. for a moment, I mean, do the 3% comp in the fiscal second quarter we know the compare of these what looks like 300 basis points starting in this April through June quarter. So I'm just wondering, your confidence and then is it accelerating comps confidence beyond just the compares? Because, again, you would think that you would see that uptick just to keep the line steady. I'm just wondering what you characterize as maybe the most impactful new product or platform that you think in the back half is going to lead to a reacceleration in that two-year trend. And then, Scott, just to clarify. Did you say for the fiscal 2017 earnings that the range you gave was wider and that if you make incremental investments you'll come in at the lower end of the range? Or were you implying that you can make investments that might lead you below the low end of that newly revised range? Thanks. Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. So I think I'll have John and Kris talk... Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Let me just frame if first and I'll hand it over to John and Kris on this. Jeffrey, let me give you three things that I think in addition to – well, number one is the sequential acceleration that we saw throughout Q2, that has continued into April. The second thing is as we look at this quarter, the work the team has done around the Frappuccino launch that was kicked off by the Unicorn Frappucinno and what we've done to really make sure that we've got innovation and line of sight to how we're going to execute in the stores against that. And if you recall, a year ago we had the launch of the transition of the Rewards program at the same time. So we've been laser-focused on how we execute better in store with that. And then certainly, beyond that, there's been a great focus that Kris has placed on our partners in the stores connecting with customers and ensuring that we're getting that uptick in customer sat, and the work that Adam Brotman has been leading to increase the throughput at peak. So the increase of throughput at peak, the work that Kris has done in terms of customer connection, the innovation in the Frappuccino and the focus on in-store execution all contribute to the confidence, in addition to the sequential monthly acceleration we've seen in comps. And so maybe I'll have Kris touch upon a bit of what he's been driving in terms of store partner connection with customers. And Adam can touch a bit maybe on the Mobile Order & Pay. Kris? Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Well, Jeffrey, I think we've got a number of things that we teed up, especially coming into the next two quarters, around operations particularly. And obviously customer connection is the most important thing we do, be it through MOP or cafe customer or whoever it was. But the reason I look to Q3 as a big opportunity is a number of things. First of all, I just think we've just gotten started on MOP service improvements. And we talked about that a good deal last quarter. The things we put in place I know Adam will share in detail in a minute. But very, very confident that we've got huge opportunity in front of us around improving that service and making sure we get more people through the stores. I think secondarily, strengthen beverage and food innovation. As I look to Q3, Frappuccino Happy Hour is going to be a huge home run this year. As Kevin mentioned, we acknowledged that we underestimated the interdependence of those two things, the Frappuccino Happy Hour and the launch of the MSR, or the conversion MSR program last year. But we have got singular focus on Happy Hour this year. We've got this early spark with Unicorn out there that has really ignited, I think, interest in the product, in the platform. We're going to bring at least one new entirely new drink into Happy Hour this year that is going to be as good as Unicorn or better. And we've extended our hours this year on some other tactical things to really make sure that Happy Hour is set up for success. I look a little further out and I see some great products we're bringing in the back half of Q3 and into Q4. We've got an entirely new iced tea platform we're bringing into the stores that's going to be a winner. Cold coffee is on fire. Our core espresso platforms around cold coffee are some of our strongest growth we've seen over the last few weeks. And food. We've talked a lot about food today, but I think the food performance in Q2 is indicative of what we're going to see in Q3 and Q4. Everything from Sous Vide eggs to our core around breakfast sandwiches have been fantastic. We're going to bring a lot of innovation in core food over the next quarter, and I'm very confident that is going to help us lift comps significantly over the next few weeks. Adam, do you want to talk about MOP? Adam B. Brotman - Starbucks Corp. Yeah, Jeffrey. This is Adam. First of all, in general, we're in the process right now of making real improvements in throughput and capacity in general. So we've got good momentum there, specifically as it relates to Mobile Order & Pay, as Kevin mentioned in his remarks. The first wave of new operational actions we've already taken in this regard have landed well in the field. We're feeling really good about the results we've already seen, both in terms of improved throughput at peak, as we've mentioned, but as well as the customer experience in those stores around MOP in general for both Rewards customers and non-Rewards customers. We saw increased peak transactions in our busiest MOP stores. We saw the greatest improvement in customer experience scores for the quarter in the latest quarter in those busiest MOP stores, and that continues into April. And we're also really pleased with how we've been able to deploy partner labor against these throughput improvements, particularly in these busiest Mobile Order & Pay stores. It's a really important part of how I think we're getting smarter in terms of shifting or reallocating labor to the morning peak opportunities occasionally, and selectively investing in labor where it makes sense to do so and where we feel good about that. So net-net, we're really happy with the early momentum we have in terms of operational improvements around getting better at MOP experiences and just in general driving our business in this area. Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. And I'll wrap up your question, Jeffrey. So, no, we're not indicating risk below the low end of the range. But I do want to acknowledge that if we see opportunities for investment or if the Teavana mall stores perform a little worse than we have forecast, that lower end is entirely in play. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. David, your line is now open. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hi. Good afternoon. Scott, just on the guidance for this year, could you give a little bit of perspective on how much of the change was related to Teavana and how much of it was related to the investments you're making? And then I guess the second question related to that, assuming that the investments is a big part of this is why make that decision now? I mean, Starbucks has such a long history of delivering on their financial targets. I think the last time you lowered guidance was during the recession. So why now are you pulling forward investments and lowering the targets? Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. On the first part of your question, the larger piece is the investments we're making, although the Teavana mall store performance versus what we thought is meaningful. And to the second part of your question, David, I take the spirit of what – how it's asked. We see a significant opportunity in areas like digital and specifically what we see with returns on investments that we make around personalization, around things around Starbucks Rewards, things that we do in the app to make things easier for our customers. Those investments have the shortest payback and the highest returns of anything we do in Starbucks including new stores. And so as we look at the back half of the year and we look at the fact that we're driving the majority of our comps from digital, I would argue we must make those investments because those will pay off both as we exit 2017 and as we head into 2018, and I think, it would be not the right thing to do to skip those. So the second thing I would say is on Reserve and Roastery, those have longer term implications for us as Howard talked about, So making those investments now as we build the Princi capabilities. A lot of these capabilities are in the early phases, building out. The commissary capability for Princi Kitchens is building out. The roasteries that we have under construction across the globe and opening our first Reserve store soon, all of those things, needs the right level of design, the right level of merchandising, and it costs money to get those things setup right. The good news is as we move into 2018 and beyond, we'll start to leverage those investments as we begin to open more and more Reserve stores, open the roasteries, and we think that's the right thing to do. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. And I think this just reinforces the fact that we're playing the long game. And in this period where this dramatic disruption is taking place in the retail industry, we are very clear that the transformative elements that we're focused on are digital, mobile relationships with our customers and branded, experiential retail. And the investments we're putting in are in those areas. It's about elevating the digital flywheel and it's about elevating the brand with the investment we're making in roasteries and Reserve stores and Princi. It's all about the future. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is now open. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Yes, thanks. Just one quick one and then I've a bigger question. Scott, did you reiterate the mid-single digit global comp guidance for the year? I just wasn't quite clear on that. And then in terms of the personalization, I know you guys have been talking about that since kind of last fall. Can you maybe give us an update on how you think that's working and maybe what's left to do there? Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. So yes, mid-single digit comps globally for the full year, and I'll turn it to Matt for the second part of the question. Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp. Thank you for the question. We are very excited about personalization. And I would just reiterate what we've been saying and it remains absolutely true. We have only just begun. Right now, personalization, we did extend from email to the app about two quarters ago. We are seeing terrific results. It is the single biggest driver that we're seeing of the improved spend per member, and we just told you what that meant for us. So it's a big deal. We haven't done a lot of the things we dream about doing and one of the reasons why we continue to invest in technology is to be able to do those things. Triggered responses to events, triggered responses to external data that we can use, continuing to put personalization elsewhere throughout the app, and then eventually extending personalization to other screens beyond the app as well. These are all on the roadmap and will be coming and we believe they'll drive significant value for the company. So we're very, very optimistic and bullish on it. Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. Maybe just one proof point to add to what Matt said. As you know, we launched this quarter suggested selling across the platform within the app. So as you're ordering your beverage, we're able to show pictures of food and other things you've either ordered in the past, or would go well with items in your basket. And we saw this quarter the ticket on Mobile Order & Pay actually go higher than the average ticket on Starbucks Rewards orders that weren't through Mobile Order & Pay. That wasn't the case over the last year. So for the first quarter we've seen that tick above as we thought it would when we launched personalization. And that's a good sign. Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp. And just to add, we have also seen acceleration through the quarter with regard to personalization. So as we entered the quarter, and as we exited, we saw personalization as one of those things we think is going to continue to drive comps up in the second half of the year. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. And we saw higher attach on food in particular. Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp. That's right. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Which is the highest since we launched La Boulange three years ago. So clearly personalization is playing a role in that success. Operator The last question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is now open. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hey, another question on the sort of U.S. comp commentary. So stores that had those peak Mobile Order & Pay stores which were in 20% of transactions, you noted sequential improvement, but are we actually back to a point that those are positive year-over-year in traffic? And then when you're thinking about the improving into April, how much of that just relates to the disruption that we're lapping last year around Mobile Order & Pay or is that true on a two-year basis as well? Thanks. Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. So, Karen, those highest volume stores were slightly negative last quarter from a transaction standpoint, and they're still slightly negative. But that – but it's improved significantly quarter to quarter. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. It was pre-adjusted. (1:19:37) Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. Yeah. So we're seeing improvement, but still a little bit of negative transaction there. Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp. Can I just clarify one condition myself? I want to make sure there's clarity and common language, because I think the question was also is comp improvement based primarily on low comparisons. The answer is no, right? Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. So in both March and April we still had pretty big comparisons to lap over, so we're pretty happy with the overall comp growth and particularly transaction growth in April. Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp. Yeah. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. And I think our comp – well, our comp performance for the back half is based on the level of innovation that we're bringing in from a product standpoint, performance at happy hour as well as continued expansion of the digital flywheel. Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp. Okay. Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp. Great. Thank you, Karen. Thank you everybody. Tom? Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp. Yeah, thanks again for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter earnings call, which we have tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 27. Thanks again.

Hosting the call today from Sepracor is Mr. Adrian Adams, President and Chief Executive Officer. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. (Operator instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to our host Mr. Adrian Adams. Please go ahead sir. Adrian Adams Good morning everyone, and thank you all for joining us for our second quarter and first half 2009 financial results webcast. With me this morning are Mark Iwicki, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Mark Corrigan, Executive Vice President of Research and Development; Bob Scumaci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and, Jonae Barns, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Before I proceed, I would like to ask Jonae to read our forward-looking statement. Jonae. Jonae Barns Good morning everyone. Various remarks that we make about our future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the SEC Safe Harbor Provisions. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, which are discussed in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is on file with the SEC, and other reports that we file with the SEC. In addition these forward-looking statements represent the Company’s expectations only as of today. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. Any forward-looking statement should not be relied upon as representing our estimates or views as of any date subsequent to today. During this call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in our second quarter 2009 operating results press release, which can be found on our website in the For Investors section. Back to you, Adrian. Adrian Adams Thank you, Jonae. And again I would to like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We have a lot to discuss this morning, but before we begin, I would like to take you through the main areas that we would like to cover during todays were passed. First, I will review how Sepracor is tracking against some of the key 2009 corporate objectives that we put in place at the beginning of the year and what accomplishments we have achieved here to date, in addition to highlighting those that we are continuing to work towards. Bob Scumaci will then comment on the second quarter and first half 2009 financial results. Bob will handle the cost over to Mark Iwicki, who will follow with an overview of our commercial performance and ongoing priorities. He will then introduce Mark Corrigan, who will provide an update on some of our research and development activities. I will then comment on our raised financial guidance for 2009, before making some concluding remarks, and opening the call up for your valued questions. Please now refer to slide number 4. I am very pleased to report that falling solid fourth quarter of 2008 and strong first-quarter 2009, we have again delivered very strong second quarter 2009 results. These strong results are even more encouraging in light to the fact that they immediately follow our strategic corporate restructuring plant, which was largely completed in the first quarter, and we're achieved in an environment that remains challenging from both an economic and industry perspective. This speaks to the singular focus we have within Sepracor, aimed at successfully executing against the goals and expectations we set. I continue to believe that almost streamlined more efficient and more focused organization has and will continue to enable Sepracor to remain competitive in today's changing environment, while providing this a platform to continue to leverage the many potential occurrence and future opportunities that face us. Our 2009 commercial structure and strategy is aimed at optimizing product growth for this year and beyond. It isn't in intended to enable improved operating leverage and productivity and to allow us to better adapt to the rapidly changing dynamics within the pharmaceutical industry, in both the short and medium term. We believe that our new commercial model, which appears to have been embraced by the Company faster than they have projected, has shown enhanced performance thus far as evidenced by solid prescription trends in product sales, as well as enhancing operating ratios as measured as a percent of revenues from the quarter. As I mentioned, Mark Iwicki will be going into greater detail on our commercial performance later on in this call. A priority in 200 9 is to drive strong topline product portfolio performance, which I'm pleased to see reflected, in our second quarter financial results and is something that has contributed to a third consecutive quarter’s strong financial performance. We will continue to focus on delivering enhanced productivity and we're very pleased with the progress we're making so far across the organization. From an R&D perspective during the quarter, and despite the disappointing results from our Phase II clinical study with SEP-289, we continue to execute against most of our near-term goals. The FDA accepted for filing the STEDESA, NDA for adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults with epilepsy. And the review appears to be going well. The PDUFA action date for STEDESA is January 30, 2010. We also initiated a monotherapy study in the United States in the second quarter, and the near future plan to submit STEDESA for regulatory approval in Canada. I'm also pleased to report that during the quarter, we had announced the successful completion of a large Phase III study of OMNARIS HFA nasal aerosol in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. And the study, specifically significantly met its primary and key secondary endpoints. We are on track to begin the second large Phase III study of OMNARIS HFA, in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, during the third quarter in 2009. We also continue to look for opportunities to strengthen all pipeline and enhance the current franchises through our many ongoing corporate development and licensing efforts we have done at this point in time. Mark Corrigan will discuss our product and research development programs will briefly address our LUNESTA pediatric studies and the recently announced filings from the Phase II study of SEP-289 later in the call. Turning briefly to some of our financial highlights, I'm extremely pleased to report that with enhanced productivity, improved expense ratios, excellent cost controls, and focused execution, we delivered strong revenue growth and very strong non-GAAP EPS results this quarter, which Bob will be discussing in more detail in a few minutes. First half 2009 non-GAAP EPS results grew by approximately 162% over the same period last year. We have also significantly strengthened our balance sheet through the combination of profitable cash generation and debt reduction. As a result of the trends we are currently seeing, we are now increasing our revenue and EPS guidance for the year, and I will review this later in the call. We are determined to and believe we are making excellent progress in continuing to deliver strong financial performance, sustainable earnings momentum, and enhanced shareholder value over time, and importantly to meet or exceed the expectations we set with our key stakeholders. Having made all these open remarks, let's now more along to our financials beginning with a more detailed review of our second quarter and first half 2009 financial results. Bob, please take us through these results. Bob Scumaci Thank you Adrian and good morning everyone. I would like to begin with slide 5, which summarizes our second quarter and first half 2009 revenue results. As Adrian alluded to, I’m pleased to report that second quarter revenues increased by approximately 11%, versus the second quarter 2008 to $326.2 million, which includes $16.9 million of previously deferred license revenue, accelerated as a result of determination of LUNIVIA agreement with GSK. First half revenues increased by 7% to $656.4 million, including the GSK accelerated deferred license revenue, versus the first half of 2008. Our product royalty and license revenues for the second quarter of 2009 were as follows. LUNESTA revenues were $151.3 million. XOPENEX Inhalation Solution revenues were $89.9 million. XOPENEX HFA revenues were $14.8 million. BROVANA revenues were $19.1 million. OMNARIS revenues were $9.1 million. ALVESCO have no revenues in the second quarter of 2009, as we continue to sell through to launch inventory. This inventory is reduced by approximately 20% in the second quarter. Sepracor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., royalty and license fee revenues were $42 million, including the one-time special item. For the first half of 2009, product, royalty, and license fee revenue were as follows. LUNESTA revenues were $291.7 million. XOPENEX Inhalation Solution revenues were $208 million. XOPENEX HFA revenues were $34.9 million. BROVANA revenues were $37.7 million. OMNARIS revenues were $15 million. Royalty, license fee, Sepracor Pharmaceuticals Inc. revenues were $69.1 million, including the one-time special item. Please now refer to slide 6, which shows GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the quarter and first half 2009 versus the same period in 2008. The increases in non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter and first half 2009 were few primarily by the continued focus on increasing contribution margin of our major products, focusing on continued expense management and productivity. I'm particularly pleased that during the first of the year, we are able to deliver such strong earnings momentum during the time in which we went through a corporate restructuring and transition to a new commercial model. As you can see in the bottom right table, the first half non-GAAP EPS for 2009 as compared to the first half non-GAAP 2008 increased by 162%. Later in the call, I will walk you through the non-GAAP adjustments and reconcile our non-GAAP results to comparable GAAP measures. But the major item in our GAAP to non-GAAP EPS reconciliation was the one-time tax gain related to the tax valuation allowance, which we released in the second quarter of 2008. This reconciliation is also available on our second quarter 2009 operating results, press release, which can be found in our website in the For Investors section. Please now refer to slide number 7, which is a summary of the second quarter 2009 non-GAAP results compared to second quarter 2008. Our objectives to deliver sustainable earnings momentum through this improved expense ratios is demonstrated in the 23% improvement in SG&A’s percentage to revenue of 48% versus 71% in Q2 ‘08. We believe that this improvement, which is primarily driven by reductions in sales and marketing expenses once again, demonstrates our commitment and progress towards achieving the projected overall fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 operating expense reduction of $210 million. These expenses expense reductions fuel the growth in non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2009 to $82 million from $8 million moving EPS to $0.72 per fully diluted share versus $0.06 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of 2008. Turning now to slide 8, you could see similar improvements for the first half of 2009 versus the first half of 2008. Again we believe that our performance in the first half of this year is an excellent indicator of our commitment to improving our expense ratios and delivering earnings momentum. We will be looking for further opportunities to improve these ratios going forward. Please now refer to slide number 9, which reconciles non-GAAP to GAAP fully diluted EPS for the second quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share of $0.72, excludes the cash gain on the early extinguishment of debt of $0.05 per diluted share, which I will address later in the presentation. The pretax restructuring charge of $0.02 per diluted share, interest expense associated with implementing FSP APB 14-1 in the first quarter of 2009, a milestone chart due to be BIAL upon the acceptance of the STEDESA NDA were formerly reviewed by the FDA, which occurred in May, and the accelerated deferred license revenue related to the termination of LUNIVIA agreement GSK. The FSP APB 14-1 and non-cash expense is highlighted in both the special and recurring sections to designate the accelerated portion related to the early extinguishment in debt and the recurring portion. As was the case in the first quarter, please note that the bifurcation relates specifically to the 2024 convertible debt and the interest expense will continue until the 2024 notes are repaid, which I anticipate will occur on the put date on October 2009, also included in the reconciliation of the recurring items, similar to those in the first quarter. Turning now to slide 10, you can see a reconciliation GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the first half of the year. Again this reconciliation is also available in our second quarter 2009 operating results press release, which can be found in our website in the For Investors section. Please now refer to slide number 11. Sepracor has continued to be opportunistic in reducing the debt position over the last six months. In addition to the tender offer for the 2024 notes, completed in Q1 ’09, which reduced our debt by $134 million to $380 million, we further reduced our debt in the second quarter by $94 million, which leaves us with a total convertible debt outstanding of $286 million as of June 30, 2009. As we noted in our last quarterly conference call, we continue to expect that the 2024 notes will be repaid in full on the put date in October 2009. Please note the numbers are adjusted for the impact of FSP APB 14-1. The net gain of $9.4 million for the first half of 2009 will be netted against the accelerated bifurcated interest expense and recorded in our income expense on our statement of operations. Our cash, short, and long-term investments were approximately $770 million as of June 30, 2009. In summary, I'm very pleased with the financial results we have delivered for the last three consecutive quarters and I look forward to a strong second half of 2009. I would like to now hand the call over to Mark Iwicki who will review our commercial operations. Mark Iwicki Thanks Bob, and good morning, everyone. Please refer to the next slide, slide number 12, which is an overview of our progress with the new commercial model. As most of you know we launched a new commercial model and restructured our sales and marketing organizations during the first quarter of 2009. This new model was put in place in response to changing trends in the macroeconomic environment, which have impacted and continued to impact the pharmaceutical industry to increased generic usage and the clients and patient-doctor office visits. This streamlined commercial model is intended to gain operating leverage to more effectively and efficiently support our current and future product portfolio. We believe that we are beginning to see the benefits of the new model flow through the top and bottom lines of our financial statement, and we have seen positive trends in our sales forces productivity during the past quarter, which was the first full quarter of post-restructuring. Evidence of these positive trends can be seen in key field metrics such as, sales representative productivity, and the number of details to target adopters. In March of this year, we organized into two business units and eliminated the mired sales line model that is common in the industry. Our sales representatives have individual territory ownership and we believe they are highly motivated to drive revenues across each of the brands for which they are responsible. In fact this individual accountability has helped to increase overall detailing volume by 16% across our sales force. We are continuing our focus on profitability for our LUNESTA and XOPENEX Inhalation Solution products and our direct-to-consumer efforts are becoming more focused and streamlined to take advantage of online media. This lower-class and broad reaching media, we believe, is a highly efficient tool that enables us to rapidly and cost effectively reach significant numbers of consumers. Finally, before I go into further detail on sales force productivity and product performance, I want to mention that we begun preparing for the potential launch of STEDESA next year. We are currently planning for a first cycle approval, which could enable us to launch as early as the first quarter of 2010. We have begun the process of key opinion leader development, and are preparing our sales and marketing plans for launch. In addition, clinical data have been rolled out at several peer-reviewed scientific and medical meetings. Please refer to slide number 13. As I mentioned, we have seen encouraging signs with improved field force productivity post-restructuring, which we believe is a testament in part to the enthusiasm our sales professionals have for the new commercial model. This we believe empowers them with individual territory ownership and the opportunity to see on a regular basis how their individual contributions can directly impact our products top line performance. Our sales reps are focused on their individual territory ownership, and we believe this individual ownership and responsibility is what is motivating them to drive revenues across each of the brands for which they are responsible. In fact this individual accountability has helped to increase the overall average productivity in terms of net sales per representative by the equivalent of approximately 21% per rep. As you can see from the graphs on this slide, on a comparative three-month basis from March to May 2009 versus March to May 2008, our representatives have improved not only in the number of prescriptions and sales per representative, but also in the number of audited details versus the same period last year. Specifically, I would like to draw your attention to the graph in the lower left, the total number of audited details during the three-month period of March to May 2008 versus March to May 2009 increased from 104,000 details to 121,000 details respectively. This 16% improvement in the aggregate number of audited P1 details is particularly significant given that there are 17% fewer representatives in 2009 versus 2008. Again, these are very encouraging trends and that we are seeing them so shortly after their restructuring plan was implemented. We have a very motivated team and are indeed delivering strong results with far fewer resources. Turning now to our LUNESTA's performance during the quarter, on slide 14. Revenues for LUNESTA in the second quarter of 2009 were $151.3 million, which is an increase of slightly more than 2% versus the second quarter of 2008. First half revenues were $291.7 million, which is an increase of 2.8% versus the first half of 2008. I would like to note that the solid performance that LUNESTA had in the first quarter and through the early phase of the sales force restructuring continued through the second quarter with an increase of approximately 8% versus Q1 2009. The overall insomnia market continues to face challenges, due to significant generate utilization that is driven by managed care and pharmacy chains. We remain focused on capturing as much of a branded market with the LUNESTA as we can. Our promotional priority for LUNESTA is to continue to differentiate our product from other agent’s particularly generic zolpidem. LUNESTA helps patients fall asleep, stay asleep, and wake up ready to take on the next day. As you can see on the graph, we have continued our focus on improved contribution for LUNESTA, quarterly revenue remain strong, while our promotional expenditures have been significantly optimized. As you saw earlier in Bob’s part of the presentation, it is this continued focus on product contribution such as that seen with LUNESTA that has led to significant improvement in our SG&A ratio as measured against product revenue on a year-over-year basis. Please now refer to slide number 15. OMNARIS is our intranasal corticosteroid that we launched in April 2008 for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergy rhinitis. Revenues from OMNARIS Nasal Spray for the second quarter of this year were $9.1 million, and for the first half of 2009, revenues were $15 million. As you can see from the graph on the left, OMNARIS is continuing to perform well even as we head into the, what is considered the low season for allergic rhinitis. The impact of seasonality can be seen in the market and for OMNARIS as we enter the summer months. In contrast, you can see that OMNARIS has continued to gain ground in share of the intranasal steroid market even in the lower season. Depicted by the orange line OMNARIS’ share of the market continues to grow and reach new heights. We believe that our new commercial model, the launch of our memorable direct-to-consumer advertising campaign and most importantly the products proven safety, efficacy, and tolerability have all contributed to the continued strength and growth of OMNARIS market share and the inhaled nasal steroid category. Our key promotional priority for OMNARIS is to focus our field force efforts on the most valuable physicians. As part of this, we will continue to drive uptick with key physician specialists such as, allergists and ear, nose, and throat specialists. We have reached a 3% market share with the key specialty of allergists and a 2% share with ENT’s. Both specialty shares have grown sharply since the launch of our new commercial model. In addition, we are seeing early positive indicators from the direct-to-consumer launch for OMNARIS, which started airing in the last week of March. Consumer awareness of OMNARIS is building nicely and as I mentioned market share has remained strong even as we are now on the low season for seasonal allergic rhinitis products. Turning now to slide number 16, BROVANA is our long acting beta analyst to prove for the maintenance treatment of bronchoconstriction in adult patients with COPD. Revenues for the second quarter of 2009 were $19.1 million, an increase of approximately 43% over the second quarter last year. For the first half of 2009, revenues were $37.7 million, an increase of approximately 63% over the first half of 2008. Driving this growth and revenues for BROVANA are increases in both retail and non-retail volume. As you can see on the graph to the left total retail and non-retail demand for BROVANA unit sold increased by 53% for the second quarter year-over-year. BROVANA has unrestricted access and approximately 93% of managed care lives and is widely available through home health care pharmacies. Our promotional priorities for BROVANA include a new specialty markets business unit, which we believe is helping to drive BROVANA growth with top prescribers, hospitals, and other key channels. Moving now to slide number 17, I would like to comment on the performance of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution and XOPENEX HFA. As you can see from the two graphs to the left both our XOPENEX Inhalation Solution and XOPENEX HFA products demonstrated second quarter year-over-year revenue growth with the Inhalation Solution growing 5.3% and HFA revenues growing by 5%. Our promotional priorities for XOPENEX franchise included new asthma sales team that will continue to focus on the XOPENEX family of products. Efforts out this new sales team are directed at top docile prescribers, as well as loyal XOPENEX prescribers, where our share continues to remain strong. Our efforts remain directed to educating healthcare professionals on the fact that XOPENEX is the only differentiated molecule in the branded short-acting beta-agonist market with advantageous over generic albuterol. In addition, we plan to continue our efforts to drive share and targeted accounts where we have a preferred position in place and will seek to optimize the channel mix to realize greater volume and higher margins for both XOPENEX Inhalation Solution and XOPENEX HFA. Please note as our home health care and therefore COPD business is now minimal XOPENEX Inhalation Solutions should experience significantly more seasonality in the low asthma season versus previous years. Moving now to slide number 18, we launched ALVESCO HFA in September of 2008. The initial focus of the launch was on key specialists. We saw positive Rx growth trends throughout the specialty launch in late 2008 and into early 2009. During the tail-end of the first quarter, we broadened our detailing efforts to focus on a select group of high potential primary care physicians. We continue to see ALVESCO share and volume build even during the low part of the asthma season. We have seen a strong trend in Rx volume and share with continued growth in key specialists such as allergists. ALVESCO now has a 4.5% market share with allergists. We are very pleased with the sharp increase in shares since the launch of our new commercial model. Our promotional priorities will be to educate primary care doctors that ALVESCO is a unique corticosteroid prodrug that is activated into des-ciclesonide after oral inhalation, and has a potent anti-inflammatory activity. We’ll continue our efforts to differentiate ALVESCO and plan to leverage the small particle size that we believe results in greater lung deposition along with the prodrug benefits. We plan on effective use of patient programs, including starter kits with co-pay reduction cards and continued use of other relationship management programs to continue to grow ALVESCO. At this time I would like to hand the call over to Mark Corrigan, who will provide an update on our progress in the R&D area. Mark? Mark Corrigan Thank you Mark. Turning to slide 19, which depicts our current pharmaceutical product candidate development pipeline. As he announced during the second quarter, STEDESA was filed with the FDA and is now under formal review as an adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures in adults with epilepsy. And we are currently enrolling patients in our US monotherapy study. Also during the quarter, we successfully completed our large-scale 707 patient Phase III study of OMNARIS HFA nasal aerosol, our nasal administrated HFA formulation of OMNARIS in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. We intend to initiate a second large-scale Phase III study with approximately 1100 patients, this time in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis during the third quarter. We are on track to file an IND for the XOPENEX ipratropium combination products in the fourth quarter. As most of you are probably aware, we did not achieve the outcome we had hoped for in our Phase II study of SEP-289. I'll be going into some detail later in the presentation on this. Our new formulation of LUNESTA SEP-018 is on track to deliver results on ongoing Phase II study before year-end. As mentioned in our last call, the FDA responded to a briefing package related to SEP-162, a dual reuptake inhibitor, being developed for the treatment of depression and has agreed with our proposal. We are currently evaluating the possible initiation of the Phase III registration trial for SEP-162. We are also currently working on a formulation of SEP-162 in combination with eszopiclone, which we refer to as SEP-164, as a potential treatment for depression and/or other indications based on the positive results we have observed in our Phase IIIB studies of LUNESTA in combination with antidepressants. Our studies of SEP-432 and SEP-900 continue to progress, and we are currently conducting formulation work on our ciclesonide inhalation solution product candidates. I would like to now briefly address our recent announcements regarding the FDA's communication to place our two ongoing pediatric trials of eszopiclone on clinical hold. As we announced, the FDA's decision was based on non-clinical data that they felt could be relevant to the administration of eszopiclone in children. I would like to emphasize that the non-clinical data resulting in the clinical hold is not related to carcinogenicity or genetic toxicology, not does the hold relate to any finds observed in the human pediatric clinical studies. Finally, this clinical hold does not have any impact on the availability of current prescribing information for LUNESTA in the treatment of adults with insomnia. We hope to work with the FDA to address a potential resolution of their concerns regarding the non-clinical data. I would like now to turn to slide 20 and SEP-289. As we announced earlier this month, our Phase II proof-of-concept study for our triple reuptake inhibitor SEP-289 did not meet its primary or key second efficacy endpoints in the treatment of depression. In addition, the adverse event profile seen in this study was inconsistent with adverse events reported in previous clinical trials. Specifically, adverse events were not meaningfully different from placebo in this particular study. These safety and efficacy results taken, with what was to be found to be low serum exposure levels for 289 is demonstrated by multiple serum concentration measurements let us to surmise that these preliminary data are inconclusive as they pertain to 289’s viability as a treatment for depression. Our assessment that patients did not achieve the amount of drug in their system that we felt would be appropriate to sufficiently test our hypothesis. We are in the process of conducting a further review to determine the underlying cost for the low serum levels in this study. Specifically, we are looking at the investigation of medicinal product itself, the clinical population and the trial methodology. Once we have completed this review and have determined the cause of low serum concentrations we will be in a position to better assess what steps if any we will take with SEP-289. That being said we still believe triple reuptake inhibitors remain an interesting target for the treatment of depression and remain committed to further exploring this unique mechanism, with our series of backup molecules including SEP-432. Moving ahead to slide 21, recently Bial's European partner Eisai presented data on the drug at the International Congress for epilepsy in (inaudible). At the top of the slide is a brief summary that shows the relatively high retention rates observed in this year-long open label extension, specifically, an average retention rate of 73.5%. Given these results, combined with STEDESA’s expected once daily dosing and relatively low adverse event profile, we believe STEDESA has the potential to cultivate a rate of compliance within the therapeutic area were compliance is essential to avoid breakthrough procedures. At the bottom of the slide, we have created a checklist to illustrate where we are in the regulatory process with STEDESA. As you can see, we have received our 74 day letter and provided our response. Our next milestone in the regulatory process is the 120 day update, which we anticipate submitting soon. Now referring to slide 22, you can see our anticipated upcoming milestones in R&D. During this quarter, we anticipate initiating the six-week OMNARIS HFA basically perennial allergic rhinitis study with approximately 1100 patients. We also anticipate submitting the regulatory package for STEDESA to be marketed in Canada. In the fourth quarter, we expect to complete the European LUNESTA venlafaxine study and provide results. I would like to point out that this clinical study is different from the one be completed with LUNESTA and Prozac, as the trial's primary endpoint is in depression and the secondary endpoint his insomnia, whereas in LUNESTA Prozac study the primary endpoint was insomnia and secondary endpoints were in depression. This study is anticipated to guide our SEP-164 strategy. We also expect to summit the post approval supplement for the LUNESTA coating change through the FDA. Lastly, in the fourth quarter, we expect to see preliminary results of SEP-018, our new formulation of LUNESTA. In the first quarter of 2010, we anticipate the initiation of Phase II for SEP-900 of potential initiation of Phase III for SEP-162 and the FDA action for STEDESA NDA. With that I would like to hand the call back over to Adrian. Adrian? Adrian Adams Thank you Mark. I would now like to summarize the revisions we have made to our financial guidance for 2009. Please turn to slide number 23. At the beginning of the year, we shared with you three uncertainties within the marketplace that resulted in our original guidance. These were firstly, whether or not the economic challenges facing the industry in 2008 would continue into 2009. Secondly, the uncertainty related to the timing of the generate of Ambien CR, and thirdly, the potential disruptive impact of the significant changes made with our sales force is part of the role out to the separate force in new commercial model. While the general market and environmental conditions facing the industry remain challenging there has not been a launch of a generic Ambien CR and our new financial guidance does not anticipate this to happen during 2009. Furthermore, the sales force changes have exceeded our expectations and the disruption has been much less than anticipated. These conditions together with the trends we are seeing across our portfolio are ongoing expense control and excellence in execution have led us to narrow both our total revenue and EPS ranges for the year, and importantly to raise our overall revenue EPS guidance ranges for 2009. Our revised 2009 total revenue guidance is to achieve revenues between $1.225 billion and $1.275 billion. This range is an increase from our previous guidance of between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion. The revised revenue guidance excludes the $16.9 million accelerated license revenue related to the GSK payment for LUNIVIA in Europe. Our sales marketing and general administrative expense guidance remains unchanged at approximately $600 million for 2009. I think it is notable that our guidance for 2009 SG&A remains $159 million less than our actual SG&A expense from 2008, a meaningful decrease. We also project our non-GAAP research and development expense will remain at approximately $210 million in 2009, which is again a decrease from 2008’s actual R&D expense. Fully diluted non-GAAP EPS guidance has also increased to a range of between $2.55 to $2.90 per diluted share, based on 114.5 million weighted average shares outstanding versus our previous guidance of between $2.10 and $2.70 per diluted share, based on 116 million weighted average shares outstanding. Of the midpoints of the range, this EPS momentum would represent an approximately 67% increase in non-GAAP EPS compared to 2008. We have also tightened guidance on our expected cash and long and short-term investments at year-end. We expect cash, short, and long-term investments as of December 31, 2009 to be approximately 550 million to 600 million, which includes the impact of the debt repayment during the second quarter of 2009. With respect to our debt position, we anticipate ending the year with approximately 100 million in convertible subordinate debt outstanding with the assumption that all our 2024 notes will be rate paid [ph] in full on the update [ph] this October as Bob mentioned earlier. I would like to call attention to this significant projected reduction in our debt position from a $531 million in par value of debt that remained at the end of 2008. Finally, I want to note that we are revising our cash tax rate to 3% from the previously anticipated 2.5% rate. This is due to higher overall income and income in states that we don't have net operating loss carry forwards. Turning to slide 24, in addition to increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance, we are also increasing our overall GAAP EPS guidance to between $0.88 and $1.12. As you can see on this slide, the list of special and recurring items that we listed on our first quarter conference call guidance reconciliation slide remains the same. Please now refer to our final slide, slide number 25. I would like to close the presentation with a summary of the second quarter and first half 2009, and then highlight our corporate priorities going forward. I am pleased that we have delivered strong performance with earnings and revenue momentum for the last three consecutive quarters. Post-restructuring, we have seen significant improvements in a number of key productivity metrics, which is now translating into strong financial performance. Year-over-year, we have continued to see improvements in expense ratios, particularly in SG&A and we will look for further opportunities to improve these ratios in 2010 and beyond. Since the third quarter of 2008, we have seen solid balance sheet improvements including a reduction of 402 million in the principal amounts of debt over this time period. I am pleased to be in a position to increase financial guidance following strong execution and a strong first half of 2009 performance. Our 2009 priorities going forward are firstly, to drive strong topline product portfolio performance with continued focus on efficiencies, effectiveness, and profitability. We will continue to focus on delivering enhanced productivity and we're very pleased with the progress we are making so far this year. Secondly, to build upon the ongoing efficiencies and their effectiveness from the corporate restructuring in order to achieve better productivity, greater accountability, and cost savings to help build a solid foundation for the future. Post-restructuring, we are very pleased with the progress we have achieved with regard to the increased productivity across many areas within our organization. The cost savings initiatives that we began to implement in the fourth quarter of 2008, we believe have contributed to the improved financial performance for the last three quarters and we're focused on continuing this trend during the second quarter of 2009. Thirdly, to successfully execute high-priority R&D initiatives to strengthen our pipeline and enhance current franchises. We have made progress advancing certain of our priority programs as we remain focused on continuing to move STEDESA to the FDA regulatory approval process and advancing the OMNARIS HFA program. Fourthly, to continue to aggressively pursue corporate development and licensing opportunities that enhance the portfolio and compliment Sepracor’s strategic direction. We are continuing to look for opportunities to strengthen our pipeline and enhance the current franchises. And finally, to deliver sustainable earnings momentum and enhance shareholder value all the time. We are committed to and remain focused on delivering earnings momentum into the second half of 2009 and beyond. In summary, we believe that we are well-positioned to take Sepracor into a new phase of momentum. My confidence level in the stability and execution capabilities within Sepracor has never been as strong as it is now and I look forward to reporting to you on how we are executing against the plan that we have put in place on an ongoing basis. At this point I would like to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen the floor is now opened for questions. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott – JP Morgan Great. Thanks. Just a couple of quick questions. May be to start off with, just give us your various thoughts as it relates to business development given your growing cash balance here, the recent setback with 289. I guess are there areas outside your core respiratory and CNS franchises that you would look or would you look at products that might require any additional sales reps or at this point, you are looking more for products that would kind of just leverage your existing infrastructure. Second, can you elaborate a little bit more on the pricing trends you are seeing with your core LUNESTA and XOPENEX franchises maybe beyond this price increases, can you talk about how you are managing rebates for these franchises. And may be along those lines, can you also talk about any inventory changes you saw for those products in the quarter. Thanks. Adrian Adams Thank you so much for your excellent questions. I think on the first point, I think a very good point, clearly we were disappointed with the results of the SEP-289 trial and clearly it puts even more importance on successfully executing more corporate development and licensing activities. Our goals from a corporate development and licensing point of view in many ways remain the same. You are quite right that our cash position is at very, very strong. We have a very focused franchise at this point in time and now that we have a very strong platform of capability and productivity from a sales force point of view, we can look for further opportunities of in-licensing products of a last phase development to support CNS and the respiratory area. We are also very interested in in-licensing products that have current revenue bases. And in the event that we saw either companies or products that had either synergistic or new therapy areas provided they made strong sense from a shareholder and fiscal point of view, we will look at those opportunities and R&D looking at those opportunities as we speak right now. So we are very focused on this. Clearly, we are excited about the near term prospects we have with our pipeline with STEDESA and I am not synergic there. That, together with strong performance for our current portfolio does not remove our focus on successfully executing corporate development and licensing activities, and our cash position puts us in a very strong position for doing that since we are rapidly becoming an even more partner of choice. On the second point on pricing-- Mark Iwicki Yes, this is Mark Iwicki. I think what we can say is that, we are really focused on improving contribution across the entire portfolio. We said quarter-after-quarter that we are concentrating on looking for the high margin pieces of business and we have done everything we can to improve contribution for LUNESTA, XOPENEX UDV, XOPENEX HFA. We do not believe this time that deep discounting to grow our market shares is really the best move for our product portfolio, and we have been really pleased with the outcomes that we have had to date. We view some innovative techniques like co-pay reduction cards and other mechanisms together to grow market share with our sales representatives. And so far, it’s been really strong development and contribution across the board. Adrian Adams Sure. On the inventory levels, let’s talk about LUNESTA for a second. We have had three consecutive quarters of decreases in our wholesale inventories. And in this quarter, we have a 1.6 million unit decrease quarter-over-quarter. On the UDV, which is seasonal of course, we have a 7.1 million unit reduction in inventory. MDI is down slightly and BROVANA and OMNARIS are relatively flat to some up tick in OMNARIS, but it’s just some minor ordering patterns and as I talked about before, ALVESCO had a decrease of 20% units quarter-over-quarter. Mark Iwicki I think we are very pleased that if one looks at some of the revenue momentum that we are seeing over the last number of weeks and months in particular, a lot of values are driven by volume enhancement. Chris Schott – JP Morgan Great. Thanks. And Adrian, (inaudible) on the business development comments, can you talk [ph] also on your willingness to take near term dilution to earnings associated with any transaction at this point. Adrian Adams No. I think my approach to corporate development and licensing is to assess all opportunities with a very open mind. And in the end, the most important aspect in corporate development and licensing is those any potential initiative whether it’s from a corporate M&A point of view, R&D, whether it’s from a product specific point of view does it makes sense to shareholders in both the near and medium term. And clearly, we are looking at a wide range of opportunities as we speak and each one of those opportunities has different perspectives. But all of them will be driven with enhancing shareholder value over the time and that is the Wholly Grail as far as our execution in corporate development and licensing is concerned. Chris Schott – JP Morgan Great. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question is from the line of Manoj Garg with Soleil Securities. Please go ahead. Manoj Garg – Soleil Securities Hey, guys. Good morning. My question centers around STEDESA and your enthusiasm around the launch of timing now. Could you update us on anything has changed regarding your comfort level now versus previously on the three [ph] pivotal studies? Mark Corrigan Yes. Hi, this is Mark Corrigan. One of the things that we Manoj is the character of the questions in the 74 day letter have increased our confidence on a couple of levels. Number one, that the FDA is under active review of it. We received a lot of questions which is we view as quite a positive sign. Secondly, of course, is the nature of the questions are such that we believe we have -- we can answer them within our current database and we are very positive about that. And finally that the -- in the context of those questions, there was nowhere points made to the pivotal trials arising from foreign data. So again that issue, it had been in the back of our mind, it did not arise in the context of the 74 day letter. It is a disease where there is I think a real medical need for a product like this and its used in adjunctive setting that might allow a division that is not known for first cycle approvals to try and meet some of their PDUFA guidelines with regard to hitting certain number first cycle approvals. So that’s raised our confidence, its not 100% but we are feeling much better about it and as a company, we want to be ready to take advantage of that should we get first cycle approval. Manoj Garg – Soleil Securities Okay, great. And then just on the national prescription audit data, are you guys seeing at this mix between what they are reporting and what you are actually seeing? Mark Iwicki Manoj, this is Mark Iwicki. You know, that’s a great question and I believe we commented on this a few quarters ago. The IMS audits are a little challenging right now. We do find that sometimes they over report and even under report. I think in general for longer term forecasting of 12 to 24 months, they are still reliable, but for month-to-month when we actually look at our units that we sell out and that move through the change, we do see a bit of a disconnect. Manoj Garg – Soleil Securities Okay. That’s fair. Thank you. Adrian Adams Thank you, Manoj. Mark Iwicki You are welcome. Operator And next we go to the line of Robert Hazlett with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Robert Hazlett – BMO Capital Markets Thanks. I have a couple of questions. First on STEDESA, could you give us or modestly [ph] the size kind of scope endpoints of the US monotherapy trial and when you expect data to be available for that? And again, Mark, if you could talk a little bit about your confidence in not meeting that data going forward. Second question is manufacturing of that product. Long term stability has been establishing and could you remind us where the manufacturing is being done and then I have one or two commercial questions, but I will let you handle those first. Mark Iwicki Sure. The monotherapy trials, it’s a very long trial, its 18 months. So we don’t anticipate seeing the data until 11. We would be progressing along this route any way out a general development for AEDs moving from the adjunctive usage to the monotherapy usage. So we didn’t do this per se to support the trial, it of course is on going and should the FDA want to understand something about the A.E. profile, then at least there would be certain patients there, but we wouldn’t wait until the break and the conclusion of the study necessarily to take a look at the data if that’s something that the FDA did ask for. And of course, there were number of issues associated with that that you might immediately think about which is the A.E. profile monotherapy might be different from that end as an adjunctive agent. Your second point, the endpoint reduction in seizure frequency and it is against historical controls. This was discussed in a special protocol assessment with the FDA and with our advisors prior to commencing the trial. Adrian Adams Yes, on the manufacturing, our partner BIAL will be manufacturing the product for us and we will receive in finished form. The stability studies, the long term stability studies are on going, they continue to go. We are looking for a 24 month dating in our filing with the FDA. Mark Iwicki I mean from a stability standpoint, it’s were noting that BIAL anticipates commercially launching the product in the second half of this year in Europe. Robert Hazlett – BMO Capital Markets Okay. Thank you. Just on the commercial side of things is there a point where OMNARIS is doing well enough that you would consider incremental ads to the DTC spend and how should we think about when -- how often that review is ongoing? Mark Iwicki Good morning, Robert. Well, we are really pleased with OMNARIS right now as you can see from the growth in prescriptions and market share especially as the season has moved to the lower season, we are just throughout. I think the marketing and sales teams are doing a great job of differentiating the product and selling it through. There is no doubt that the DTC campaign has also helped us with our performance and we do evaluate all the time what the right level is. Right now, we have been every efficient with our spend, if you would look at the audits, you would see that, in general, we are significantly less than the other branded products and yet we have relatively strong awareness in the marketplace and I think that’s because of a great job by the brand teams in developing a super commercial. And I think we want to see how we make it through the rest of the season and for sure we want to have a strong position for the fall allergy season. Robert Hazlett – BMO Capital Markets Okay. So shifting to ALVESCO for a minute, what do you think the specific points of resistance are to prescribing that product and we have seen a pick up relatively recently as you pointed out on the graph, do you think you have addressed those at this point or is more clinical data or more horsepower commercially necessary to really drive that product? Adrian Adams Well, I think that we had a nice launch to the specialists late last year. But I really wanted to emphasis the point that it was just the specialists and then we held off from the broader full launch in the first quarter because we knew that we are going to restructure the sales organization. And I am really pleased that since the new commercial model has been launched and ALVESCO has a major prominent position in our Asthma Sales team that the volume and the share has picked up nicely. So I believe that it’s really a matter of us continuing to focus on our strong execution, differentiating the product based on its safety, efficacy and tolerability features, and that we would be able to continue to grow. The season is in the low season right now, we still been gaining share and some volume even in the low season. And so I see that as a really good sign and we are going to continue these efforts for the rest of the year. Robert Hazlett – BMO Capital Markets Great. Thank you for the color. Adrian Adams You are welcome. Operator Your next question is from Frank Pinkerton with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Frank Pinkerton – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Great. Thanks for taking the question. And just a follow-up on one, I think there was kind of previously asked or may be some more detail, when I look at LUNESTA and XOPENEX, the price prescript as you would backward calculate that from your sales continues to go up, could you just speak to rebating levels or what is actually driving that because I haven’t seen this kind of price increases that you have talked about? Adrian Adams Well, I think the color that I could give you is similar to what we have talking about which is that, we are very focused on increasing contribution. We are looking at every single contract that we have in the marketplace, we are evaluating those for profitability and we are making very sound business decisions to be able to improve that contribution. Bob Scumaci And let me just mention that there was a price increase in early January in LUNESTA and that is not reflected in the financial statements as of the end of June. Adrian Adams July. Bob Scumaci July, sorry July. The price increase has been in July, but it doesn’t -- it didn’t impact any of the financial statements as of June. Frank Pinkerton – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Okay. Great. And then just, Adrian, you kind of did speak a little bit towards it, if you could hit it up again, what’s the change over in the sales force, how do you do morale and do you have the correct people now in place after a couple of years to take the organization forward, are we looking at any additional changes from a standpoint of either new business heads or revamping of this sales force? Adrian Adams I think if one looks broadly across the organization and more specifically within the sales force, I think we do regular human resource pulses within the business and get regular feedbacks from within the organization. I would say that the morale of the sales force at this point in time is the highest it’s been for some considerable time. We have some very talented, very focused and quality professionals who are particularly and energetically embarrassing the new commercial model. I think if you talk to any one of our sales professionals, I think the fact that they really control their own territory and can really direct their efforts and be rewarded based on that has given a sense of productivity, a sense of ownership and a sense of energy that we haven’t seen for sometime. We are very, very confident of the new commercial model and I think the morale aspects and the satisfaction levels within the organization are very high. I think when it comes down to the broader aspects of leadership and talent within the organization, we are very pleased that our retention rates of our talented employees, it remains very low significantly below industry trends and I think that’s a reflection of the enthusiasm and satisfaction, and I think I am very happy with the broader aspects of leadership and I think the stability of the platform, the stability of the organization is the best that I have seen and that gives me confidence not just for this year as reflected in our increased guidance, but also moved into 2010. And we are going to be really focused on making sure we grow this organization in an environment where all people can flourish with high levels of satisfaction and enthusiasm. Frank Pinkerton – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Okay. Great. And then I think I may be I heard wrong, but on 162, did you say that’s going to move into a Phase II trial or Phase III trial on the back half of the year and if that is a Phase III, is that included in the R&D guidance? Bob Scumaci Not this year. What we are contemplating is, as you may recall, we have proposed to the FDA moving to a single Phase III trial. They agreed with our proposal, they did add a lower to one of the study a lower dose and we are currently in some formulation work on the product and are considering whether we take that forward in 2010 not in 2009, the formulation work is in the guidance for this year. Frank Pinkerton – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Great. Thank you. Operator Our next question is from Ian Sanderson with Cowen. Please go ahead. Ian Sanderson – Cowen & Co. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to reiterate with LUNESTA inventory levels, its 1.6 million unit decrease, is that quarter-over-quarter or year-to-date and same with XOPENEX 1.7 and may be if you could put those into context of either percentages or inventory days. Bob Scumaci Yes. We just give the decrease and increase period over period, and the 1.6 million is quarter-over-quarter. Ian Sanderson – Cowen & Co. Okay. And can you give us rough percentage there? Bob Scumaci No. We are not going to go into that at this point. Ian Sanderson – Cowen & Co. Okay. And may be if you, if Mark could tell us a little bit about where do you stand on 432 in trials following the 289 next year [ph] and whether you are re-evaluating of the dosing there? Mark Iwicki Yes. That’s a great question, Ian. So 432, we move through the MVPK [ph] and so we would be gearing towards a food effect trial and we have got some other preclinical work that’s ongoing. Your point is really good, what is really beating up the data now to think about whether as we would take these products forward, would we take them forward in more of an experimental medicine paradigm with a PK/PD trial and measuring concentrations in patients as patients may respond very differently to the doper [ph] merger stimulation as compared with normal. So the short answer is, yes, we have -- are evaluating our scientific plan particularly human clinical plan in light of the data that we have on 289. Some of those issues on 289 are likely 289 specific as it may relate to the low CRM [ph] levels, however, the A.E. profiles are something that we think may be more mechanism depended (inaudible). Ian Sanderson – Cowen & Co. Okay. And then, Bob, just a quick question, the decrease in the projected shares outstanding for the year as well for the quarter, what drove that? Bob Scumaci Yes, there is two things specifically. One is the break [ph] down of 2010 debt which was dilutive in our overall calculation. Ian Sanderson – Cowen & Co. Okay. Bob Scumaci Then our overall shared distribution, auction then restricted stock distribution within the company. Ian Sanderson – Cowen & Co. Thank you. Operator Our next question is from Greg Gilbert with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Thanks. Good morning. Bob, to follow-up on the inventory question, are you at the bottom end of the range allowed for your IMAs at this point? Bob Scumaci No. We are not and our goal is to continue to decrease inventories for the rest of the year. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Okay. Do those IMA speak to units or weeks? Bob Scumaci Weeks. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Okay. But you are just not willing to share what those are. Bob Scumaci Correct. Yes, we are going to just continue with units. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Okay. Bob Scumaci I think it shows a better trend. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Okay. For Mark Corrigan, can you shed a little more light on the non-clinical issues affecting the LUNESTA pediatric program and why the FDA would not be concerned about those issues as they apply to adult usage and do you think the pediatric expansion is off the table at this point? Mark Corrigan The toxicologies that we have seen in the (inaudible) are similar to toxicologies that we observed in the adults. So they are not brand new. So I don’t think that the question is what the relevance to them to children may be different, and that’s one of the things we are discussing with the FDA at this point in time. But that’s what because the FDA is actually seeing these toxicologic results associated with them; we don’t think that they are going to be a relevant to the adult prescribing piece. You know, as far as the written request forgoes, we continue to take a position that we are following the written request working with the FDA in order to fulfill whatever requirements that they have put in front of us, and that hasn’t really been raised at this point by the agency or ourselves. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Just to be clear on that, Mark, that means you still could get the six month pediatric expansion or not? Mark Corrigan Yes. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Okay. And then lastly for Mark Iwicki, you mentioned the rebate by down cards, do you think that’s a sustainable trend in the industry and perhaps for Bob, does that come out in SG&A or gross to net. Thanks. Mark Iwicki Yes, it’s a great question and I am sure people saw the Wall Street Journal article. I think really truly only time will tell. I am not sure. I really like the idea of helping the consumer, the patient with the co-pay and I think having some of that let’s call the overall rebate money that’s put into the system go directly to the patient I think is a good thing. I think that’s good for the doctor, good for the patient, and helps them take medicines that are really going to benefit them. And so it’s been a good tool for us and our sales representatives to be able to compete strongly, once again, without at this time using a heavily deep discounted contracting strategy. So I think we will have to wait to see how it plays out. We are always evaluating our options and so far I think our brand marketing teams and our sales teams have done a very nice job using this and I am sure as you know, there are many pharmaceutical companies are now using these co-pay reduction cards. Bob Scumaci And as for the actual cost, the actual -- the co-pay reduction portion is grows in that item, but the actual program cost to run the program is part of SG&A. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Okay. Thanks guys. Mark Iwicki Thanks. Operator Our next question is from Adam Greene with RBC. Please go ahead. Adam Greene – RBC Capital Markets Hi, good morning. Follow-up on some previous questions on LUNESTA ASP, just going forward, is that 115, 116 we saw this quarter, is that still a good number to use or should we expect an increase following the July 1 st  10% price increase. And then you mentioned the focus on increased contribution as it was driving that, what exactly does that mean? Is that mean, you are walking away from customers that are, one big discounts or just can you clarify that a little bit more for us? Bob Scumaci Sure. We look at on all parts of LUNESTA’s contribution. We’ve really streamlined our promotional activities. I think it’s been commented on many times that we are not on television right now with DTC, we use some very efficient online media. We have also streamlined some of our other marketing and sales expenses which is really helping on the bottom line. And on the top line, we have been very strategic about our contracting approach. We have renegotiated some contracts which have been a benefit for us overall for the total contribution of LUNESTA, and we have been able to hold on to significant volume even while taking those actions. So I believe that we are doing a very nice job right now of optimizing the top line and the bottom line, and I believe that’s reflected in the performance we have had now for the three straight quarters. Adam Greene – RBC Capital Markets And ASP, is that a good number going forward or should we expect it to bounce around more, any help on that? Bob Scumaci We don’t really talk about it return prices, but the new ad prices is $5.08 for LUNESTA. Adam Greene – RBC Capital Markets Right and you say we saw no impact in Q2, so obviously it should affect that of those flow through? Bob Scumaci Yes, the whole increase doesn’t flow through. Adam Greene – RBC Capital Markets Right. Bob Scumaci There is a net impact, but that will be in the third quarter. Adam Greene – RBC Capital Markets Okay. And just second question, what are the NOLs right now? Bob Scumaci You know what, its better to take a look at those in the 10-Q. I think better to get the information there. Adam Greene – RBC Capital Markets Okay. Thanks. Operator Our next question is from Richard Silver with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Richard Silver – Barclays Capital Yes. Sorry, back to the LUNESTA inventory levels and just also your comment about IMS data, this in the second quarter, did you see more of the disparity between the IMS data and other sources versus the first quarter. And I guess the second question is, would the number that you reported in the second quarter be a good base for going forward or is there anything that may have been unusual in the second quarter? Bob Scumaci I will talk about the inventory for a second. I don’t think it was anything unusual. I think it’s been our goal from the beginning of the year to steadily reduce our inventory levels and I think they will continue to be reduced in the third and fourth quarter. Whether it’s the same amount or something little less, I am not sure yet, it all depends on the ordering patterns, but anticipated to decrease in the rest of the year. What we have seen with LUNESTA IMS data is a bit of variable picture in what we would call the true up to the actual units that we are selling. I think IMS would be the best one to answer specific questions about the data. I know that they have put some fixtures in place for May [ph] order that causes some of the discrepancy. But as I said before, we are really using IMS for a longer term forecasting and we use some other data sources to really make sure we are fully accurate with the units that we have moving through the marketplace. Richard Silver – Barclays Capital Okay. And so the question about whether the second quarter number is a good base, you would say, your answer is yes? Bob Scumaci Is your question about whether or not the TRx that you are seeing is a good-- Richard Silver – Barclays Capital And the sales number and then using TRx is to grow from that sales number. Bob Scumaci Yes. I think it’s a good base. Once again, it does move around a little bit month-to-month and we true that up internally. I think for long term forecasting which is the way that most models are build, I think IMS is still fine to those longer term models. Richard Silver – Barclays Capital Okay. And then on the operating expenses, in particular R&D, historically, the company has under spent relative to the beginning of any given years guidance. As we are looking into the second half, can you point to any programs that could in fact push the R&D spending up meaningfully to get to that full year number that’s still unchanged even though the second quarter appeared low relative to our numbers, obviously you didn’t provide guidance but relative to our numbers. Bob Scumaci No, I think this year is a little bit different than previous years. I think we came in with a solid number of 210 and I think that number is pretty solid for the rest of the year. Richard Silver – Barclays Capital And what is it in the second half that you could point to that might lead to that meaningful up tick in the second. Bob Scumaci The 1,100 patient perennial allergic rhinitis, OMNARIS HFA study. Richard Silver – Barclays Capital Okay. And on SG&A, anything there? I mean in terms of spending trends on SG&A, you mentioned you are much more streamlined with your DTC? Is there anything in the second half that where we could see meaningful changes in trend? Bob Scumaci Well, I don’t think there is a meaningful change. I think some of the trends will continue. There is specific programs in the back half of the year, but its so varied and complex that there is no one specific item. Adrian Adams And I think an important thing to note is, as we move into the August, September through the end of the year that is a very big season for us now with asthma, allergy products consuming a large portion of our spent and evaluating our programs with LUNESTA as well. There is some seasonality to our spent. Richard Silver – Barclays Capital And just lastly on the gross margin, seems to have an up tick in the second quarter versus first quarter. Should we assume that this is also a sustainably higher [ph] number or is it just a function of mix and it will be bouncing around between what we saw in the first and the second quarter? Bob Scumaci I think it will be bouncing around. I don’t think you could take the second quarter and extrapolate that out. Richard Silver – Barclays Capital Okay. Thank you. Adrian Adams Thank you. Operator Our next question is from Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead. Marc Goodman – UBS Hi. Adrian, with respect to business development, how are you thinking about primary care versus specialty type products, the industry is kind of moving more to specialty and what are you thinking about it? Adrian Adams Clearly, if one looks at our overall product portfolio now, we have a mix of specialty and primary care orientation. I think, as Mark alluded to on the call, we are very pleased with the way the new structure is settled down, but in particular, I think if one looks at our focus in terms of detailing, capacity and direction, it increasingly is moving more towards a specialty focus. So as it relates to corporate development and licensing, clearly if we are able to in-license, acquire either products or companies with a specialty orientation that is in keeping with our ongoing strategic and evolving direct source more of a specialty field. Marc Goodman – UBS And no major changes in your thoughts of business development? Adrian Adams No major thoughts. Clearly, I think we have always remained very active and we have a lot of very active discussions as we speak. And clearly, the goals remain in-license last stage assets. We are also looking at M&A potential with companies all with the eye of enhancing shareholder value and making strong fiscal sense in the near to medium term. Marc Goodman – UBS And just, I guess just another question on that, and there was surprised not only your company but just some of the other kind of specialty pharma companies that need product that have infrastructure, they haven’t done more deals with a lot of these biotech’s of products, they haven’t been able to get public. There have been some deals this year, but I am just surprised to having done more. Are these companies just having a hard time coming to grip the evaluations or why these deals aren’t happening? Adrian Adams Well, I think I project that probably as we move into the second half of this year into next year, you will probably see a pickup in deal making. I think clearly with a lot of the challenges from an economic cash flow general pharmaceutical industry environments I think most people have been looking for some degrees of stability. I think we have been very active in looking at corporate development and licensing opportunities. I think we have also been very focused on making sure that the sound stability and financial and metric stability of the organization is strong which is the strongest its been for a long time. And I think that’s probably reflecting the number of other pharmaceutical companies. I think clearly a lot of the discussions that we are having with other parties, I think clearly I think we are at optimizing level on the corporate under licensing for the industry per se is that probably you will start to see a pickup in that activity over the course of the next six to nine months. I think it has been unusual, I would agree with you that, but I do not think that’s reflects (inaudible) basis. Marc Goodman – UBS And your focus in the United States or equally is focused in Canada now, and what are your thoughts on Europe? Adrian Adams I think we are particularly focused obviously on the United States. I think from a Canada point of view, our strong focusing calendar is looking for the submission of STEDESA in Canada and on with discussions on the potential submission for LUNESTA in Canada. Any activities outside North America relate to opportunities to plan [ph] assets and also to look for opportunity to bring in products from Europe into the United States. We are very focused in terms of North America. I believe passing it the key to success is not just a strong stable organization, but absolute focus in what happens -- in all aspects of the business but in particular corporate development and licensing. Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator And that will be from the line of Bill Tanner with Lazard. Please go ahead. Bill Tanner – Lazard Capital Markets Thanks for taking the questions. There is couple of them, one on you mentioned the DTC spent on LUNESTA has been pulled back, just thinking about how we should be thinking about anticipation of what the Company might do with (inaudible) and perhaps to a lesser extent generic CR? And then secondly just on 289, I don’t know if you are in a position to provide a little bit more detail with respect to the comment that the concentration of the drug wasn’t as high as expected, if you could somewhat quantitate that I am assuming that you are talking about the early end of the curve, and then finally just timing on the next steps as to the resolution of this? Thank you. Mark Iwicki Maybe I will handle the first question, this is Mark Iwicki. I think when it comes to future entrants into the market place whether that it CR (inaudible), we have plans in place and are prepared for those entrants. We have been very pleased with our revenue and prescription strength even without the DTC on the air. I know that I have talked a few times about our strong efforts online, which is a very efficient way for us to still reach consumers and conduct compliance and persistency programs. I think we always have the option of altering our promotional mix, but I feel like we have a very strong sales and marketing plan in place right now and we are ready for competitors, should they launch. Mark Corrigan Yes on 289, I think we released that the exposures we saw were 50% on a mean basis in terms of concentration, mean concentrations to what we have predicted from the Phase I multi-dose (inaudible) study. And I kind of outlined our line of increase, we are looking at whether the 289 substance itself remains stable whether dissolution constant had changed on the clinical trial population, obviously we are interested, this is a population (inaudible) to -- for the protocol requirements had to undergo, had to fill a previous trial and whether the SSRIs or antidepressants they took before had up regulated any metabolic processing, so that they in fact had metabolic drug more rapidly or alternatively does the substance them self induce its own metabolism, those are all questions that are on the table and obviously then we are looking at assays that we had had. We are going to take some time to understand this. So, I can’t give you an immediate time frame for what we do and we will be obviously presenting the result at a scientific meeting in the future. Adrian Adams Thank you operator and thank you all for joining us this morning. As I mentioned, I am very pleased with the strong results we have just announced and the fact that this our third consecutive quarter of strong results and obviously confidence in -- as it builds into the increased guidance for the year. And I look forward to updating you on our progress we make to the second half of this year and on the plans we are putting in place for building this business into the future over our next quarterly call, So, you all have a good day and I look forward to speaking with you again in the not to distant future. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen,   this does conclude today’s teleconference. An audio replay of today’s call will be available for one week starting today at 12 pm Eastern Standard Time.

Ladies and gentlemen the floor is now opened for questions. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott – JP Morgan Great. Thanks. Just a couple of quick questions. May be to start off with, just give us your various thoughts as it relates to business development given your growing cash balance here, the recent setback with 289. I guess are there areas outside your core respiratory and CNS franchises that you would look or would you look at products that might require any additional sales reps or at this point, you are looking more for products that would kind of just leverage your existing infrastructure. Second, can you elaborate a little bit more on the pricing trends you are seeing with your core LUNESTA and XOPENEX franchises maybe beyond this price increases, can you talk about how you are managing rebates for these franchises. And may be along those lines, can you also talk about any inventory changes you saw for those products in the quarter. Thanks. Adrian Adams Thank you so much for your excellent questions. I think on the first point, I think a very good point, clearly we were disappointed with the results of the SEP-289 trial and clearly it puts even more importance on successfully executing more corporate development and licensing activities. Our goals from a corporate development and licensing point of view in many ways remain the same. You are quite right that our cash position is at very, very strong. We have a very focused franchise at this point in time and now that we have a very strong platform of capability and productivity from a sales force point of view, we can look for further opportunities of in-licensing products of a last phase development to support CNS and the respiratory area. We are also very interested in in-licensing products that have current revenue bases. And in the event that we saw either companies or products that had either synergistic or new therapy areas provided they made strong sense from a shareholder and fiscal point of view, we will look at those opportunities and R&D looking at those opportunities as we speak right now. So we are very focused on this. Clearly, we are excited about the near term prospects we have with our pipeline with STEDESA and I am not synergic there. That, together with strong performance for our current portfolio does not remove our focus on successfully executing corporate development and licensing activities, and our cash position puts us in a very strong position for doing that since we are rapidly becoming an even more partner of choice. On the second point on pricing-- Mark Iwicki Yes, this is Mark Iwicki. I think what we can say is that, we are really focused on improving contribution across the entire portfolio. We said quarter-after-quarter that we are concentrating on looking for the high margin pieces of business and we have done everything we can to improve contribution for LUNESTA, XOPENEX UDV, XOPENEX HFA. We do not believe this time that deep discounting to grow our market shares is really the best move for our product portfolio, and we have been really pleased with the outcomes that we have had to date. We view some innovative techniques like co-pay reduction cards and other mechanisms together to grow market share with our sales representatives. And so far, it’s been really strong development and contribution across the board. Adrian Adams Sure. On the inventory levels, let’s talk about LUNESTA for a second. We have had three consecutive quarters of decreases in our wholesale inventories. And in this quarter, we have a 1.6 million unit decrease quarter-over-quarter. On the UDV, which is seasonal of course, we have a 7.1 million unit reduction in inventory. MDI is down slightly and BROVANA and OMNARIS are relatively flat to some up tick in OMNARIS, but it’s just some minor ordering patterns and as I talked about before, ALVESCO had a decrease of 20% units quarter-over-quarter. Mark Iwicki I think we are very pleased that if one looks at some of the revenue momentum that we are seeing over the last number of weeks and months in particular, a lot of values are driven by volume enhancement. Chris Schott – JP Morgan Great. Thanks. And Adrian, (inaudible) on the business development comments, can you talk [ph] also on your willingness to take near term dilution to earnings associated with any transaction at this point. Adrian Adams No. I think my approach to corporate development and licensing is to assess all opportunities with a very open mind. And in the end, the most important aspect in corporate development and licensing is those any potential initiative whether it’s from a corporate M&A point of view, R&D, whether it’s from a product specific point of view does it makes sense to shareholders in both the near and medium term. And clearly, we are looking at a wide range of opportunities as we speak and each one of those opportunities has different perspectives. But all of them will be driven with enhancing shareholder value over the time and that is the Wholly Grail as far as our execution in corporate development and licensing is concerned. Chris Schott – JP Morgan Great. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question is from the line of Manoj Garg with Soleil Securities. Please go ahead. Manoj Garg – Soleil Securities Hey, guys. Good morning. My question centers around STEDESA and your enthusiasm around the launch of timing now. Could you update us on anything has changed regarding your comfort level now versus previously on the three [ph] pivotal studies? Mark Corrigan Yes. Hi, this is Mark Corrigan. One of the things that we Manoj is the character of the questions in the 74 day letter have increased our confidence on a couple of levels. Number one, that the FDA is under active review of it. We received a lot of questions which is we view as quite a positive sign. Secondly, of course, is the nature of the questions are such that we believe we have -- we can answer them within our current database and we are very positive about that. And finally that the -- in the context of those questions, there was nowhere points made to the pivotal trials arising from foreign data. So again that issue, it had been in the back of our mind, it did not arise in the context of the 74 day letter. It is a disease where there is I think a real medical need for a product like this and its used in adjunctive setting that might allow a division that is not known for first cycle approvals to try and meet some of their PDUFA guidelines with regard to hitting certain number first cycle approvals. So that’s raised our confidence, its not 100% but we are feeling much better about it and as a company, we want to be ready to take advantage of that should we get first cycle approval. Manoj Garg – Soleil Securities Okay, great. And then just on the national prescription audit data, are you guys seeing at this mix between what they are reporting and what you are actually seeing? Mark Iwicki Manoj, this is Mark Iwicki. You know, that’s a great question and I believe we commented on this a few quarters ago. The IMS audits are a little challenging right now. We do find that sometimes they over report and even under report. I think in general for longer term forecasting of 12 to 24 months, they are still reliable, but for month-to-month when we actually look at our units that we sell out and that move through the change, we do see a bit of a disconnect. Manoj Garg – Soleil Securities Okay. That’s fair. Thank you. Adrian Adams Thank you, Manoj. Mark Iwicki You are welcome. Operator And next we go to the line of Robert Hazlett with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Robert Hazlett – BMO Capital Markets Thanks. I have a couple of questions. First on STEDESA, could you give us or modestly [ph] the size kind of scope endpoints of the US monotherapy trial and when you expect data to be available for that? And again, Mark, if you could talk a little bit about your confidence in not meeting that data going forward. Second question is manufacturing of that product. Long term stability has been establishing and could you remind us where the manufacturing is being done and then I have one or two commercial questions, but I will let you handle those first. Mark Iwicki Sure. The monotherapy trials, it’s a very long trial, its 18 months. So we don’t anticipate seeing the data until 11. We would be progressing along this route any way out a general development for AEDs moving from the adjunctive usage to the monotherapy usage. So we didn’t do this per se to support the trial, it of course is on going and should the FDA want to understand something about the A.E. profile, then at least there would be certain patients there, but we wouldn’t wait until the break and the conclusion of the study necessarily to take a look at the data if that’s something that the FDA did ask for. And of course, there were number of issues associated with that that you might immediately think about which is the A.E. profile monotherapy might be different from that end as an adjunctive agent. Your second point, the endpoint reduction in seizure frequency and it is against historical controls. This was discussed in a special protocol assessment with the FDA and with our advisors prior to commencing the trial. Adrian Adams Yes, on the manufacturing, our partner BIAL will be manufacturing the product for us and we will receive in finished form. The stability studies, the long term stability studies are on going, they continue to go. We are looking for a 24 month dating in our filing with the FDA. Mark Iwicki I mean from a stability standpoint, it’s were noting that BIAL anticipates commercially launching the product in the second half of this year in Europe. Robert Hazlett – BMO Capital Markets Okay. Thank you. Just on the commercial side of things is there a point where OMNARIS is doing well enough that you would consider incremental ads to the DTC spend and how should we think about when -- how often that review is ongoing? Mark Iwicki Good morning, Robert. Well, we are really pleased with OMNARIS right now as you can see from the growth in prescriptions and market share especially as the season has moved to the lower season, we are just throughout. I think the marketing and sales teams are doing a great job of differentiating the product and selling it through. There is no doubt that the DTC campaign has also helped us with our performance and we do evaluate all the time what the right level is. Right now, we have been every efficient with our spend, if you would look at the audits, you would see that, in general, we are significantly less than the other branded products and yet we have relatively strong awareness in the marketplace and I think that’s because of a great job by the brand teams in developing a super commercial. And I think we want to see how we make it through the rest of the season and for sure we want to have a strong position for the fall allergy season. Robert Hazlett – BMO Capital Markets Okay. So shifting to ALVESCO for a minute, what do you think the specific points of resistance are to prescribing that product and we have seen a pick up relatively recently as you pointed out on the graph, do you think you have addressed those at this point or is more clinical data or more horsepower commercially necessary to really drive that product? Adrian Adams Well, I think that we had a nice launch to the specialists late last year. But I really wanted to emphasis the point that it was just the specialists and then we held off from the broader full launch in the first quarter because we knew that we are going to restructure the sales organization. And I am really pleased that since the new commercial model has been launched and ALVESCO has a major prominent position in our Asthma Sales team that the volume and the share has picked up nicely. So I believe that it’s really a matter of us continuing to focus on our strong execution, differentiating the product based on its safety, efficacy and tolerability features, and that we would be able to continue to grow. The season is in the low season right now, we still been gaining share and some volume even in the low season. And so I see that as a really good sign and we are going to continue these efforts for the rest of the year. Robert Hazlett – BMO Capital Markets Great. Thank you for the color. Adrian Adams You are welcome. Operator Your next question is from Frank Pinkerton with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Frank Pinkerton – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Great. Thanks for taking the question. And just a follow-up on one, I think there was kind of previously asked or may be some more detail, when I look at LUNESTA and XOPENEX, the price prescript as you would backward calculate that from your sales continues to go up, could you just speak to rebating levels or what is actually driving that because I haven’t seen this kind of price increases that you have talked about? Adrian Adams Well, I think the color that I could give you is similar to what we have talking about which is that, we are very focused on increasing contribution. We are looking at every single contract that we have in the marketplace, we are evaluating those for profitability and we are making very sound business decisions to be able to improve that contribution. Bob Scumaci And let me just mention that there was a price increase in early January in LUNESTA and that is not reflected in the financial statements as of the end of June. Adrian Adams July. Bob Scumaci July, sorry July. The price increase has been in July, but it doesn’t -- it didn’t impact any of the financial statements as of June. Frank Pinkerton – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Okay. Great. And then just, Adrian, you kind of did speak a little bit towards it, if you could hit it up again, what’s the change over in the sales force, how do you do morale and do you have the correct people now in place after a couple of years to take the organization forward, are we looking at any additional changes from a standpoint of either new business heads or revamping of this sales force? Adrian Adams I think if one looks broadly across the organization and more specifically within the sales force, I think we do regular human resource pulses within the business and get regular feedbacks from within the organization. I would say that the morale of the sales force at this point in time is the highest it’s been for some considerable time. We have some very talented, very focused and quality professionals who are particularly and energetically embarrassing the new commercial model. I think if you talk to any one of our sales professionals, I think the fact that they really control their own territory and can really direct their efforts and be rewarded based on that has given a sense of productivity, a sense of ownership and a sense of energy that we haven’t seen for sometime. We are very, very confident of the new commercial model and I think the morale aspects and the satisfaction levels within the organization are very high. I think when it comes down to the broader aspects of leadership and talent within the organization, we are very pleased that our retention rates of our talented employees, it remains very low significantly below industry trends and I think that’s a reflection of the enthusiasm and satisfaction, and I think I am very happy with the broader aspects of leadership and I think the stability of the platform, the stability of the organization is the best that I have seen and that gives me confidence not just for this year as reflected in our increased guidance, but also moved into 2010. And we are going to be really focused on making sure we grow this organization in an environment where all people can flourish with high levels of satisfaction and enthusiasm. Frank Pinkerton – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Okay. Great. And then I think I may be I heard wrong, but on 162, did you say that’s going to move into a Phase II trial or Phase III trial on the back half of the year and if that is a Phase III, is that included in the R&D guidance? Bob Scumaci Not this year. What we are contemplating is, as you may recall, we have proposed to the FDA moving to a single Phase III trial. They agreed with our proposal, they did add a lower to one of the study a lower dose and we are currently in some formulation work on the product and are considering whether we take that forward in 2010 not in 2009, the formulation work is in the guidance for this year. Frank Pinkerton – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Great. Thank you. Operator Our next question is from Ian Sanderson with Cowen. Please go ahead. Ian Sanderson – Cowen & Co. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to reiterate with LUNESTA inventory levels, its 1.6 million unit decrease, is that quarter-over-quarter or year-to-date and same with XOPENEX 1.7 and may be if you could put those into context of either percentages or inventory days. Bob Scumaci Yes. We just give the decrease and increase period over period, and the 1.6 million is quarter-over-quarter. Ian Sanderson – Cowen & Co. Okay. And can you give us rough percentage there? Bob Scumaci No. We are not going to go into that at this point. Ian Sanderson – Cowen & Co. Okay. And may be if you, if Mark could tell us a little bit about where do you stand on 432 in trials following the 289 next year [ph] and whether you are re-evaluating of the dosing there? Mark Iwicki Yes. That’s a great question, Ian. So 432, we move through the MVPK [ph] and so we would be gearing towards a food effect trial and we have got some other preclinical work that’s ongoing. Your point is really good, what is really beating up the data now to think about whether as we would take these products forward, would we take them forward in more of an experimental medicine paradigm with a PK/PD trial and measuring concentrations in patients as patients may respond very differently to the doper [ph] merger stimulation as compared with normal. So the short answer is, yes, we have -- are evaluating our scientific plan particularly human clinical plan in light of the data that we have on 289. Some of those issues on 289 are likely 289 specific as it may relate to the low CRM [ph] levels, however, the A.E. profiles are something that we think may be more mechanism depended (inaudible). Ian Sanderson – Cowen & Co. Okay. And then, Bob, just a quick question, the decrease in the projected shares outstanding for the year as well for the quarter, what drove that? Bob Scumaci Yes, there is two things specifically. One is the break [ph] down of 2010 debt which was dilutive in our overall calculation. Ian Sanderson – Cowen & Co. Okay. Bob Scumaci Then our overall shared distribution, auction then restricted stock distribution within the company. Ian Sanderson – Cowen & Co. Thank you. Operator Our next question is from Greg Gilbert with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Thanks. Good morning. Bob, to follow-up on the inventory question, are you at the bottom end of the range allowed for your IMAs at this point? Bob Scumaci No. We are not and our goal is to continue to decrease inventories for the rest of the year. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Okay. Do those IMA speak to units or weeks? Bob Scumaci Weeks. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Okay. But you are just not willing to share what those are. Bob Scumaci Correct. Yes, we are going to just continue with units. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Okay. Bob Scumaci I think it shows a better trend. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Okay. For Mark Corrigan, can you shed a little more light on the non-clinical issues affecting the LUNESTA pediatric program and why the FDA would not be concerned about those issues as they apply to adult usage and do you think the pediatric expansion is off the table at this point? Mark Corrigan The toxicologies that we have seen in the (inaudible) are similar to toxicologies that we observed in the adults. So they are not brand new. So I don’t think that the question is what the relevance to them to children may be different, and that’s one of the things we are discussing with the FDA at this point in time. But that’s what because the FDA is actually seeing these toxicologic results associated with them; we don’t think that they are going to be a relevant to the adult prescribing piece. You know, as far as the written request forgoes, we continue to take a position that we are following the written request working with the FDA in order to fulfill whatever requirements that they have put in front of us, and that hasn’t really been raised at this point by the agency or ourselves. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Just to be clear on that, Mark, that means you still could get the six month pediatric expansion or not? Mark Corrigan Yes. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Okay. And then lastly for Mark Iwicki, you mentioned the rebate by down cards, do you think that’s a sustainable trend in the industry and perhaps for Bob, does that come out in SG&A or gross to net. Thanks. Mark Iwicki Yes, it’s a great question and I am sure people saw the Wall Street Journal article. I think really truly only time will tell. I am not sure. I really like the idea of helping the consumer, the patient with the co-pay and I think having some of that let’s call the overall rebate money that’s put into the system go directly to the patient I think is a good thing. I think that’s good for the doctor, good for the patient, and helps them take medicines that are really going to benefit them. And so it’s been a good tool for us and our sales representatives to be able to compete strongly, once again, without at this time using a heavily deep discounted contracting strategy. So I think we will have to wait to see how it plays out. We are always evaluating our options and so far I think our brand marketing teams and our sales teams have done a very nice job using this and I am sure as you know, there are many pharmaceutical companies are now using these co-pay reduction cards. Bob Scumaci And as for the actual cost, the actual -- the co-pay reduction portion is grows in that item, but the actual program cost to run the program is part of SG&A. Greg Gilbert – Merrill Lynch Okay. Thanks guys. Mark Iwicki Thanks. Operator Our next question is from Adam Greene with RBC. Please go ahead. Adam Greene – RBC Capital Markets Hi, good morning. Follow-up on some previous questions on LUNESTA ASP, just going forward, is that 115, 116 we saw this quarter, is that still a good number to use or should we expect an increase following the July 1 st  10% price increase. And then you mentioned the focus on increased contribution as it was driving that, what exactly does that mean? Is that mean, you are walking away from customers that are, one big discounts or just can you clarify that a little bit more for us? Bob Scumaci Sure. We look at on all parts of LUNESTA’s contribution. We’ve really streamlined our promotional activities. I think it’s been commented on many times that we are not on television right now with DTC, we use some very efficient online media. We have also streamlined some of our other marketing and sales expenses which is really helping on the bottom line. And on the top line, we have been very strategic about our contracting approach. We have renegotiated some contracts which have been a benefit for us overall for the total contribution of LUNESTA, and we have been able to hold on to significant volume even while taking those actions. So I believe that we are doing a very nice job right now of optimizing the top line and the bottom line, and I believe that’s reflected in the performance we have had now for the three straight quarters. Adam Greene – RBC Capital Markets And ASP, is that a good number going forward or should we expect it to bounce around more, any help on that? Bob Scumaci We don’t really talk about it return prices, but the new ad prices is $5.08 for LUNESTA. Adam Greene – RBC Capital Markets Right and you say we saw no impact in Q2, so obviously it should affect that of those flow through? Bob Scumaci Yes, the whole increase doesn’t flow through. Adam Greene – RBC Capital Markets Right. Bob Scumaci There is a net impact, but that will be in the third quarter. Adam Greene – RBC Capital Markets Okay. And just second question, what are the NOLs right now? Bob Scumaci You know what, its better to take a look at those in the 10-Q. I think better to get the information there. Adam Greene – RBC Capital Markets Okay. Thanks. Operator Our next question is from Richard Silver with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Richard Silver – Barclays Capital Yes. Sorry, back to the LUNESTA inventory levels and just also your comment about IMS data, this in the second quarter, did you see more of the disparity between the IMS data and other sources versus the first quarter. And I guess the second question is, would the number that you reported in the second quarter be a good base for going forward or is there anything that may have been unusual in the second quarter? Bob Scumaci I will talk about the inventory for a second. I don’t think it was anything unusual. I think it’s been our goal from the beginning of the year to steadily reduce our inventory levels and I think they will continue to be reduced in the third and fourth quarter. Whether it’s the same amount or something little less, I am not sure yet, it all depends on the ordering patterns, but anticipated to decrease in the rest of the year. What we have seen with LUNESTA IMS data is a bit of variable picture in what we would call the true up to the actual units that we are selling. I think IMS would be the best one to answer specific questions about the data. I know that they have put some fixtures in place for May [ph] order that causes some of the discrepancy. But as I said before, we are really using IMS for a longer term forecasting and we use some other data sources to really make sure we are fully accurate with the units that we have moving through the marketplace. Richard Silver – Barclays Capital Okay. And so the question about whether the second quarter number is a good base, you would say, your answer is yes? Bob Scumaci Is your question about whether or not the TRx that you are seeing is a good-- Richard Silver – Barclays Capital And the sales number and then using TRx is to grow from that sales number. Bob Scumaci Yes. I think it’s a good base. Once again, it does move around a little bit month-to-month and we true that up internally. I think for long term forecasting which is the way that most models are build, I think IMS is still fine to those longer term models. Richard Silver – Barclays Capital Okay. And then on the operating expenses, in particular R&D, historically, the company has under spent relative to the beginning of any given years guidance. As we are looking into the second half, can you point to any programs that could in fact push the R&D spending up meaningfully to get to that full year number that’s still unchanged even though the second quarter appeared low relative to our numbers, obviously you didn’t provide guidance but relative to our numbers. Bob Scumaci No, I think this year is a little bit different than previous years. I think we came in with a solid number of 210 and I think that number is pretty solid for the rest of the year. Richard Silver – Barclays Capital And what is it in the second half that you could point to that might lead to that meaningful up tick in the second. Bob Scumaci The 1,100 patient perennial allergic rhinitis, OMNARIS HFA study. Richard Silver – Barclays Capital Okay. And on SG&A, anything there? I mean in terms of spending trends on SG&A, you mentioned you are much more streamlined with your DTC? Is there anything in the second half that where we could see meaningful changes in trend? Bob Scumaci Well, I don’t think there is a meaningful change. I think some of the trends will continue. There is specific programs in the back half of the year, but its so varied and complex that there is no one specific item. Adrian Adams And I think an important thing to note is, as we move into the August, September through the end of the year that is a very big season for us now with asthma, allergy products consuming a large portion of our spent and evaluating our programs with LUNESTA as well. There is some seasonality to our spent. Richard Silver – Barclays Capital And just lastly on the gross margin, seems to have an up tick in the second quarter versus first quarter. Should we assume that this is also a sustainably higher [ph] number or is it just a function of mix and it will be bouncing around between what we saw in the first and the second quarter? Bob Scumaci I think it will be bouncing around. I don’t think you could take the second quarter and extrapolate that out. Richard Silver – Barclays Capital Okay. Thank you. Adrian Adams Thank you. Operator Our next question is from Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead. Marc Goodman – UBS Hi. Adrian, with respect to business development, how are you thinking about primary care versus specialty type products, the industry is kind of moving more to specialty and what are you thinking about it? Adrian Adams Clearly, if one looks at our overall product portfolio now, we have a mix of specialty and primary care orientation. I think, as Mark alluded to on the call, we are very pleased with the way the new structure is settled down, but in particular, I think if one looks at our focus in terms of detailing, capacity and direction, it increasingly is moving more towards a specialty focus. So as it relates to corporate development and licensing, clearly if we are able to in-license, acquire either products or companies with a specialty orientation that is in keeping with our ongoing strategic and evolving direct source more of a specialty field. Marc Goodman – UBS And no major changes in your thoughts of business development? Adrian Adams No major thoughts. Clearly, I think we have always remained very active and we have a lot of very active discussions as we speak. And clearly, the goals remain in-license last stage assets. We are also looking at M&A potential with companies all with the eye of enhancing shareholder value and making strong fiscal sense in the near to medium term. Marc Goodman – UBS And just, I guess just another question on that, and there was surprised not only your company but just some of the other kind of specialty pharma companies that need product that have infrastructure, they haven’t done more deals with a lot of these biotech’s of products, they haven’t been able to get public. There have been some deals this year, but I am just surprised to having done more. Are these companies just having a hard time coming to grip the evaluations or why these deals aren’t happening? Adrian Adams Well, I think I project that probably as we move into the second half of this year into next year, you will probably see a pickup in deal making. I think clearly with a lot of the challenges from an economic cash flow general pharmaceutical industry environments I think most people have been looking for some degrees of stability. I think we have been very active in looking at corporate development and licensing opportunities. I think we have also been very focused on making sure that the sound stability and financial and metric stability of the organization is strong which is the strongest its been for a long time. And I think that’s probably reflecting the number of other pharmaceutical companies. I think clearly a lot of the discussions that we are having with other parties, I think clearly I think we are at optimizing level on the corporate under licensing for the industry per se is that probably you will start to see a pickup in that activity over the course of the next six to nine months. I think it has been unusual, I would agree with you that, but I do not think that’s reflects (inaudible) basis. Marc Goodman – UBS And your focus in the United States or equally is focused in Canada now, and what are your thoughts on Europe? Adrian Adams I think we are particularly focused obviously on the United States. I think from a Canada point of view, our strong focusing calendar is looking for the submission of STEDESA in Canada and on with discussions on the potential submission for LUNESTA in Canada. Any activities outside North America relate to opportunities to plan [ph] assets and also to look for opportunity to bring in products from Europe into the United States. We are very focused in terms of North America. I believe passing it the key to success is not just a strong stable organization, but absolute focus in what happens -- in all aspects of the business but in particular corporate development and licensing. Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator And that will be from the line of Bill Tanner with Lazard. Please go ahead. Bill Tanner – Lazard Capital Markets Thanks for taking the questions. There is couple of them, one on you mentioned the DTC spent on LUNESTA has been pulled back, just thinking about how we should be thinking about anticipation of what the Company might do with (inaudible) and perhaps to a lesser extent generic CR? And then secondly just on 289, I don’t know if you are in a position to provide a little bit more detail with respect to the comment that the concentration of the drug wasn’t as high as expected, if you could somewhat quantitate that I am assuming that you are talking about the early end of the curve, and then finally just timing on the next steps as to the resolution of this? Thank you. Mark Iwicki Maybe I will handle the first question, this is Mark Iwicki. I think when it comes to future entrants into the market place whether that it CR (inaudible), we have plans in place and are prepared for those entrants. We have been very pleased with our revenue and prescription strength even without the DTC on the air. I know that I have talked a few times about our strong efforts online, which is a very efficient way for us to still reach consumers and conduct compliance and persistency programs. I think we always have the option of altering our promotional mix, but I feel like we have a very strong sales and marketing plan in place right now and we are ready for competitors, should they launch. Mark Corrigan Yes on 289, I think we released that the exposures we saw were 50% on a mean basis in terms of concentration, mean concentrations to what we have predicted from the Phase I multi-dose (inaudible) study. And I kind of outlined our line of increase, we are looking at whether the 289 substance itself remains stable whether dissolution constant had changed on the clinical trial population, obviously we are interested, this is a population (inaudible) to -- for the protocol requirements had to undergo, had to fill a previous trial and whether the SSRIs or antidepressants they took before had up regulated any metabolic processing, so that they in fact had metabolic drug more rapidly or alternatively does the substance them self induce its own metabolism, those are all questions that are on the table and obviously then we are looking at assays that we had had. We are going to take some time to understand this. So, I can’t give you an immediate time frame for what we do and we will be obviously presenting the result at a scientific meeting in the future. Adrian Adams Thank you operator and thank you all for joining us this morning. As I mentioned, I am very pleased with the strong results we have just announced and the fact that this our third consecutive quarter of strong results and obviously confidence in -- as it builds into the increased guidance for the year. And I look forward to updating you on our progress we make to the second half of this year and on the plans we are putting in place for building this business into the future over our next quarterly call, So, you all have a good day and I look forward to speaking with you again in the not to distant future. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen,   this does conclude today’s teleconference. An audio replay of today’s call will be available for one week starting today at 12 pm Eastern Standard Time. The dial-in number is 320-365-3844 and the pin number is 106718. We ask that you please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Chris Brathwaite. Sir, please begin. Chris Brathwaite Thank you operator. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Sears Holdings Earnings Call. I'm Chris Brathwaite, Vice President of Corporate Communications for Sears Holdings, and I'm joined today by Rob Riecker, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning we released our first quarter results for 2017, which are available on the Investors section of our website under events and presentations.

Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the presentation and today's earnings release. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the presentation. I will now hand off the call to Rob. Rob Riecker Thanks, Chris. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Let's turn to Slide 4. In the first quarter, we continued to take decisive actions to improve our operational performance and liquidity position. I will highlight some of the key initiatives we have executed to drive our transformation. In April, we increased our annualized cost savings target from our ongoing restructuring program to $1.25 billion from $1.0 billion. Based on the significant progress we delivered during the first quarter, including $700 million in annualized cost savings action to date. As part of the program, we completed the previously announced closure of 150 nonprofitable stores and initiated the closure of 92 underperforming pharmacy operations in certain Kmart stores and 50 Sears Auto Center locations. We took various actions to simplify our organizational structure and drive operational efficiencies, including consolidation of the leadership of retail operations for Sears and Kmart, and the elimination of certain senior management roles. And we conducted a comprehensive review of the company's value chain to identify broader opportunities for competitively priced products that drive cost savings. These actions contributed to the significant reduction in our operating expenses during the first quarter. And we continue to take necessary steps to rationalize our cost base to offset continued revenue pressures in a difficult retail environment. We believe this restructuring program is critical to become a more competitive, efficient and agile retailer moving forward. Moving to our financial flexibility. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we have successfully executed numerous transactions to increase our financial flexibility to fund our operations and continue transformation. As previously announced in February 2017, we entered into an amendment to our existing asset-based credit facility, which reduced our aggregate revolver commitment from 1.97 billion to 1.5 billion, and provided additional flexibility in the form of 250 million increase in the general debt basket from 750 million to 1 billion. In addition, the amendment implemented other modifications to covenants and reserves against our credit facility borrowing base that improved net liquidity. We also completed the sale of the Craftsman brand to Stanley Black & Decker for a net present value of over 900 million in cash and received an initial upfront cash payment of 525 million, which was subject to closing cost and an adjustment for working capital.These actions provided us with the confidence to target a $1.5 billion reduction in our debt and pension obligations, as we were able to use the proceeds from asset sales, including those from the Craftsman sale and the sale of real estate properties to reduce these obligations. During the first quarter of 2017, we were able to pay down approximately 418 million of our term loan debt outstanding. And as previously announced, we reached an agreement to extend the maturity of 400 million of our $500 million 2016 secured loan facility from July 2017 to January 2018, which I will discuss in detail shortly. Beyond the completed transactions I've outlined, we continue to evaluate our options to generate additional liquidity and improve our capital position. As previously announced, the special committee established by our Board of Directors to market certain real estate properties continues to evaluate offers with the target of raising at least 1 billion in proceeds. As of the date of this call, the special committee has executed 28 million of real estate sales, out of over 700 million and non-overlapping bids received to date on over 60 separate real estate properties. The committee is evaluating the remaining offers and is expecting additional bids in the near future. We are planning on using the proceeds from the sales of these properties to further reduce our outstanding debt and strengthen the company's balance sheet. We continue to have a valuable real estate portfolio, which at the end of the quarter comprised of over 900 leases with significant optionality, as well as over 350 owned stores, many in prominent locations. We continue to have a high degree of flexibility across our store leases as a result of the minimal base lease commitment and renewal options. We will continue to assess opportunities to right size our store footprint and inventory levels to ensure they're aligned to our ongoing transformation to an asset-light integrated retail model. Going forward, we will also continue to evaluate strategic options to unlock value from our Kenmore and DieHard brands, as well as our Sears Home Services and Sears Auto Center businesses through partnerships, joint ventures or other means. While these actions are aimed at unlocking value and creating financial flexibility, we also continue to work towards providing a more rewarding member experience to our Shop Your Way ecosystem. A key development in the last quarter was the official launch of our new Sears MasterCard with Shop Your Way, which we developed in partnership with Citi. Our new MasterCard offers an industry-leading rewards program including 5% back-end points on eligible purchases made at gas stations, 3% back-end points on eligible purchases at grocery stores and restaurants, 2% back-end points on eligible purchases made in Sears and Kmart, and 1% back-end points on all other eligible purchases. We believe this new credit card product will significantly strengthen the competitiveness of our Shop Your Way platform and has the opportunity to become a key performance driver of our company. Turning to Slide 5 for key operational and financial performance highlights in Q1. From a member engagement perspective, we are increasingly focused on expanding frequency of usage of Shop Your Way. We are doing this through targeted marketing and member engagement initiatives that leverage our data analytics and personalization capabilities, and we are seeing the results. We have tens of millions of active members and that number continues to grow. We expanded our VIP program to reward our members based on spending frequency and addition to traditional spend based points architecture, which has resulted in a nearly a 50% increase in the number of VIP members year-to-date, compared to the same period last year. We saw an increase in the number of trips, order volumes and cross-category purchases by our members as they became more aware of our Shop Your Way benefits, and we also continue to actively pursue new partnerships and other membership offerings to deliver more value and better services to our members. On the product and innovation front. We were named 2017 Partner of the Year by ENERGY STAR, and received their sustained excellence award for our long-term commitment to protecting the environment through the achievements of our energy efficiency initiatives. Our proprietary Kenmore brand partnered with the ENERGY STAR program to introduce new certified products across multiple categories in 2016, earning the brand numerous Best Buy designations from a leading consumer publication. We were honored to be recognized for our product innovations and had built on this achievement. Earlier this month, Edison awards, which recognizes the best in innovation and excellence and the development of new products, honored the Craftsman brand at Sears with one gold and two bronze awards for innovation. In addition, we opened the first DieHard Auto Center in San Antonio, Texas in February of 2017. With a new and innovative store format that offers state of the art technology and services in a contemporary, comfortable setting that combined with our experienced associates can help today's drivers make the right choices for their vehicles' needs. We also continue to take decisive actions to improve our business performance and drive our transformation. As we previously indicated, the retail headwinds persisted in the first quarter with continued softness in the store traffic and elevated promotional markdowns due to competition. We reported total revenue of $4.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017, compared to $5.4 billion in the same quarter last year, representing a decrease of $1.1 billion. This was largely driven by having fewer stores in operations, which accounted for $557 million of the sales decline, and declines in our comparable store sales due to industry headwinds I just mentioned, which accounted for $417 million of the decline. Our first quarter comparable store sales at Sears and Kmart declined 11.9% on a combined basis compared to the prior year period. Kmart comparable store sales declined 11.2% during the first quarter of 2017, led by declines in the grocery and household, pharmacy, apparel and home categories. While Sears Domestic comparable store sales decreased 12.4% during the quarter, primarily driven by decreases in the home appliances of apparel and Lawn & Garden categories. Selling and administrative expenses decreased by $236 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the prior year quarter. This significant expense reduction was largely attributable to the steps we've taken to improve our operational efficiency, including our reductions in payroll. In addition, advertising expense declined as we shifted away from traditional advertising through the use of Shop Your Way points awarded to members, the expense for which, is included in gross margin. As a result of the Craftsman sale, we recorded first quarter net income of $244 million as compared to a net loss of $471 million in the same quarter last year. We reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $222 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $181 million in the prior year first quarter. As a reminder, reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation and today's earnings release. So while we have made significant progress in reducing our cost base and enhancing our member value proposition, we need to take further action. Moving to the next slide, I would like to review our financial position. At the end of the first quarter, we had a total cash balance of $264 million compared to $286 million at the end of the last quarter, ending January 28, 2017. We ended the quarter with $551 million in short-term borrowings, consisting of $536 million of revolver borrowings and $15 million of commercial paper outstanding. Merchandise inventories decreased to $3.9 billion at the end of first quarter, compared to $5 billion at the end of the same period last year. Merchandise payables at the end of the first quarter were $961 million, down from $1.3 billion in the first quarter of the 2016. The significant reduction in our merchandise inventory and payables is primarily driven by our efforts to tightly manage our inventory, as well as the closure of nonprofitable stores. At April 29, 2017, our total long-term debt including current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations was $3.7 billion compared to $4.2 billion at January 28, 2017. We continually review our options to further derisk our balance sheet and increase our financial flexibility. Earlier this week, we reached an agreement with our lenders to extend a portion of our $500 million 2016 secured loan facility, originally maturing in July of 2017. Through this agreement, we extended the maturity of $400 million at the same interest rate through January of 2018, with the option to extend of the loan until July of 2018. Finally, we have been evaluating our options for derisking the Sears pension plan to which we have contributed over $3.7 billion since 2005. On May 15, we were pleased to enter into an agreement to purchase a group annuity contract from MetLife. Under this agreement we transferred approximately $515 million of the current Sears pension plan benefit obligations to MetLife and reduced the size of the Sears pension plans by approximate 51,000 participants. Starting August 1, 2017, MetLife will begin making benefit payments and providing administrative services to the effective retirees. All retirees will receive the same monthly benefit they were receiving from the Sears plan. This action is expected to have an immaterial impact on the funded status of our total pension liability and obligations, but will serve to reduce the size of the company's combined pension plan, reduce future cost volatility and reduce future planned administrative expenses. With that, let's move to the final slide. In summary, we remain committed to improving our operational performance and financial flexibility in a very challenging retail environment. We have certainly made significant progress on our strategic initiatives in the first quarter of 2017, including $700 million in cost savings actions. Through these actions, we significantly reduced our SG&A expenses during the first quarter and are committed to taking further decisive steps to improve our short-term performance and strengthen our financial position. Consistent with our ongoing strategy of focusing on our best stores, best categories and best members, we are sharpening our focus on profitable areas of our business. Our comprehensive restructuring program is now targeting 1.25 billion of annualized cost savings by the end of the fiscal year, a $250 million increase from our previous target. As we previously mentioned, we entered into an agreement with MetLife to annuitize $515 million of pension liability. In addition, we increased our financial flexibility to an agreement to extend the maturity of $400 million of our $500 million 2016 secured loan facility. And we continue to evaluate ways to improve our financial position by unlocking value from our asset base, including our Kenmore and DieHard brands as well as our Home Services and Auto Center businesses. We will continue to closely evaluate the stores where a clear path to return to profitability is not in sight. We are determined to take necessary actions to improve the performance of Sears Holdings, and will leverage our lease optionality to reconfigure our stores and reduce capital obligations. As we reduced the company's overall cash funding requirements, we will be better equipped to support our continued focus on the evolution of the Shop Your Way ecosystem. We remain focused on its integrative retail strategy, and are actively pursuing new partnerships and other membership offerings to deliver more value and better services for our members. We are firmly focused on delivering our targets and look forward to reporting progress. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Quintin Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Quintin J. Lai Thank you, Kevin. Good morning. Thank you to everyone participating on this call and the webcast. Presenting for the company, we have Rakesh Sachdev, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Bertsch, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Rakesh will start with the review of our second quarter 2014 performance and highlights. Jan will then provide a review of our financial performance. Following Jan's remarks, we'll open up the call for your questions and comments. We will be using a slide presentation as part of today's call. That presentation can be viewed on our Investor Relations website at www.sigmaaldrich.com. Before beginning the review, I want to remind you that today's comments include forward-looking statements about future activities and our expectations for sales, earnings, cash flow and other possible future results. While we believe these expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ materially due to any number of factors, including the risk factors listed in our latest annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in the cautionary statements included in today's earnings release and slide presentation. We have no plans to update these forward-looking statements after this call. Also in today's conference call, we are providing information on non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses these measures in its internal analysis of results, and believes this information may be informative to investors as well. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please see today's earnings release in the appendix to the slide presentation. Now, Rakesh? Rakesh Sachdev Thanks, Quintin. And good morning to everyone on the conference call and the webcast. In the second quarter, we achieved record sales of $701 million, representing 2% organic sales growth. This growth was led by our Applied business unit and by an improving U.S. Research environment. And our second quarter growth would have been higher, had we not been impacted by the timing of deliveries for several large SAFC contract manufacturing orders that I will explain in more detail in a few minutes. We also expanded both our gross and adjusted operating income margins, despite FX headwinds in the quarter, which contributed to a record adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.11. Our margin expansion is being driven by improvements in our global supply chain, leverage from higher volume, pricing and expense controls. And with respect to free cash flow, we generated $232 million in the first half of 2014, and we remain on track to generate over $475 million for the full year. In addition to our solid financial performance, I am pleased that our company received 2 more prestigious sustainability awards in the quarter. We were ranked #5 out of 500 U.S. corporations in Newsweek's 2014 Green Rankings. This represents the third time for Sigma-Aldrich to be on this list, moving up substantially from the last ranking. And we were ranked #28 in Corporate Responsibility Magazine's list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens. Sustainability at Sigma-Aldrich directly supports our mission of enabling science to improve the quality of life. We recognize the impact that being a responsible corporate citizen can have on making the world a cleaner, healthier and safer place to live, and we are honored to be recognized for our continuous efforts. Turning now to business unit highlights in the quarter. In the second quarter, our Research business unit's organic sales growth was flat as compared to last year. This was below our expectation of low single-digit growth for the quarter. We saw an improvement in U.S. Research sales as year-over-year sales growth moved to positive territory and improved 4 percentage points from the first quarter 2014. We were encouraged to see U.S. academic sales improved as the quarter progressed. The U.S. funding environment is showing some signs of improvement, and we are cautiously optimistic that this gradual pace of improvement will continue through the balance of the year. In Asia-Pacific, China and Southeast Asia was strong, offset by softness in India, Oceania and South Korea. Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, Research academic sales declined early in the quarter due to delays in funding release in certain countries, but turned nicely positive in June, and we expect this momentum to continue in the second half of the year. Northern and Eastern Europe maintained solid growth. Research pharma organic sales growth while flat globally, improved sequentially from the first quarter, driven largely by significant strengthening in the U.S. Our strategic account management initiatives have yielded new account wins, which are helping to offset R&D reductions and site closures by some of our large pharma customers. Our Research dealer segment had good growth in the quarter, with continued success in our Dealers as Partners program. During the quarter, the Research business unit launched several new cutting edge products and collaborations. We initiated collaborations with leading academic and research hospitals to provide gene-editing solutions such as CRISPR, partnering with core facilities at leading institutions is an effective way to gain access to a larger customer base. We also launched TruPAGE precast gels for the analysis of nucleic acids and proteins, which provide high performance, superior reproducibility and a longer shelf life than standard polyacrylamide gels. And TruPAGE is compatible with the popular gel running equipment that is already installed in labs around the world. I have talked in the past about the successful collaboration we have formed with the Scripps Institute. As an example, through this collaboration, we have recently launched a new chlorination technology, called Palau-Chlor. This technology represents a substantial improvement over existing methods with higher safety, higher yields and targeted chlorination, and we expect to launch more products from this collaboration in the coming months. Building on our strength in gene and cell engineering, we have launched a suite of ADME/Tox solutions for our drug discovery customers. Our ADME/Tox cell-based portfolio is a novel suite of [indiscernible] that were created in human cells, and I expect it to translate directly to human physiology. More importantly, the proprietary assays were developed to meet industrial and regulatory demands. These assays are available in a consumable, ready-to-use format to allow for rapid, reproducible and consistent data generation to enable drug discovery. We expect demand to continue to rise as this new technology displaces existing methods that are less reliable. Our Applied business unit had another solid quarter of broad-based 6% organic sales growth across all geographies. In our Diagnostics & Testing segment, we saw double-digit growth in our analytical chemistry initiatives and standards, and another good quarter of growth of stable isotopes for diagnostic tests. In particular, the growth in Asia-Pacific was very strong. In the U.S, our Industrial segment had solid growth in the quarter, led by material science offerings used in a variety of specialty polymers and our sales to ag bio customers. Let me highlight for you some of the initiatives that our Applied teams are working on. As a leading provider of critical raw materials and components to the in-vitro diagnostics market, we have been expanding our Elite brand of buffers and enzymes. As part of our enhanced quality profile program, these products cater to the stringent need of today's diagnostic manufacturing environment for supply chain transparency, design control and change control modification. We are also winning new OEM manufacturing projects. Within our facilities, we have dedicated, state-of-the-art platforms that meet the critical needs for custom IVD manufacturing. We have more than 40 sites with ISO certifications and about 20 cGMP sites. As another example, in nonclinical testing, we are seeing broadened adoption of radiello brand air monitoring devices to monitor the air quality in elementary and high schools in France. Next week, at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry meeting in Chicago, we will be featuring our Diagnostics & Testing products and services. Our campaign this year is quality is timeless. Our customers are telling us that they are facing more regulatory scrutiny and requirements, which have forced them to examine their supply chain integrity and risk management. Sigma-Aldrich, a long established leader in quality and delivery, is a meeting this need through supply and delivery of raw materials and components, in a variety of packaging formats. Along with our certified manufacturing capabilities, we efficiently handle a broad range of over 160,000 raw materials, that we manufacture or procure through an extensive sourcing network. And all along the process, we provide a full range of QC assays, ranging from qPCR western, northern and southern blots, protein depletion, Bioburden, endotoxins, HPLC, mass spec and ion content, to name a few. Our team is excited about the momentum that is building, and I believe we have ample opportunities to fuel future growth, both organically and through acquisitions. We are now 1.5 years into the formation of our Applied business unit, and I am pleased with the progress that the team has made. Our SAFC Commercial business unit had organic sales growth of 1%, as approximately $6 million of contract manufacturing sales, originally forecast in Q2, were delayed, largely due to customer regulatory approvals and availability. Had this not occurred, SAFC Commercial organic sales growth would have been in the mid-single digits. Contract manufacturing accounts for about 15% of SAFC sales. Of this $6 million, we expect about $2 million to be recorded in the fourth quarter and $4 million in 2015. In addition, we expect about $4 million of projected Q3 sales to move out to Q4. And as we have often said, our SAFC Commercial business can be lumpy at times. However, our actual order bookings remain strong and give us good visibility for the remainder of this year. Also, in our Life Science products segment, Biopharma materials, which includes our cell culture media and buffers business, and represents about 40% of SAFC sales, had another quarter of solid growth. Life Science Services, about a quarter of SAFC sales, continue to enjoy robust performance in Q2, with double-digit sales growth, led by our biotesting and safety services, viral clearance and gene therapy platforms. I am very pleased with the results that we are seeing from our BioReliance acquisition. And finally, our Hitech business had a better-than-expected quarter, with sales growth of semiconductor precursors somewhat offsetting an expected and continued decline in LED precursors. As we announced earlier this year, we have been more selective in pursuing certain LED precursor customers, and have reduced our China exposure, which will impact Hitech sales for the rest of the year. Excluding the impact of Hitech, China grew about 15% for the total company in the quarter and similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. In our Hitech business, we are also taking action in Europe to consolidate some of our manufacturing capacity, which will likely be completed in 2015. We continue to make progress with our capacity expansion plans in SAFC. In the fourth quarter, dry powder media production in Irvine, Scotland will come online, as well the expansion of High Potent API production in Verona, Wisconsin. And we expect to add commercial scale antibody-drug conjugate capacity in St. Louis in mid-2015. I want to close by saying that we had a solid second quarter, despite some the issues that I've just discussed. With our reaffirmed second half sales outlook and positive margin trends, we are raising the lower end of our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $4.32 to $4.40, from a prior range of $4.30 to $4.40. Our company generates strong cash flow and has an excellent balance sheet. And we will continue to invest in organic and inorganic opportunities to increase value for our customers, shareholders and our employees. Now I'll turn it over to Jan. Jan? Jan A. Bertsch Thank you, Rakesh. Sales in the second quarter of 2014 were $701 million, an increase of 3% from last year. On an organic basis, sales grew 2%. On an adjusted basis, excluding restructuring and other charges, operating income was $185 million, an increase of 4% from last year. GAAP and adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.11. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased reported sales by 1%. Net of hedging, FX had no impact on adjusted EPS for the quarter. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $89 million. For the first 6 months of 2014, the company generated $232 million of free cash flow, and we remain on track for our full year guidance of more than $475 million. In the second quarter of 2014, organic sales growth for the Research business unit was flat. The academic, government and hospital segment declined low single digits. U.S. academic sales growth improved to flat, compared to a decline of mid-single digits in the first quarter. While some of the sequential improvement was caused by Q1 weather, we also saw increased demand from U.S. academic and NIH researchers. EMEA Research academic sales declined early in the quarter due to delays in funding release in certain countries, but turned nicely positive in June, and we expect this momentum to continue in the second half of the year. We expect that the second half of the year will show a return to low single-digit growth in this region. APAC Research sales were flat in the quarter, with strong, high single-digit growth in China, offset by weakness in India, South Korea and Oceania. Research pharma sales were flat in the quarter. Sales to biotech customers continue to be robust. We saw improving research pharma demand in the U.S., but experienced continued weakness in CROs in Asia. And sales through our dealer network grew in the low- to mid- single-digit range. Q2 2014 organic sales growth for the Applied business unit was 6%. In our Diagnostics & Testing segment, we had double-digit growth. Analytical chemistry initiatives and standards contributed to this growth. In addition, as Rakesh mentioned, our customers have come to appreciate our elite brand portfolio for their high-quality supply chain transparency and design control. And this category was up in the high-single digit range. Our custom contract manufacturing kitting and service offerings for diagnostic manufacturers are also gaining momentum. These initiatives, combined with another robust quarter of stable isotope sales, drove the growth for the quarter. On a modeling note, we expect Diagnostics & Testing growth to moderate in the fourth quarter, as we face a tougher year-over-year comps due to strong stable isotope sales in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our Industrial segment organic sales growth was in the low single-digits. U.S. growth in the quarter was strong, driven by our material science offering of specialty polymers and sales of plant cell culture media materials used by our ag bio customers. We also had double-digit growth in the raw materials we provide to manufacture DNA. In the second quarter 2014, SAFC organic sales growth was 1%. Life Science products sales declined in the low to mid-single-digit range. As Rakesh mentioned, the timing of large, multimillion dollar orders can cause quarter-to-quarter performance to be lumpy. We continue to have strong order bookings, and we currently anticipate the delayed delivery timing in Q2 and Q3 to positively impact our fourth quarter of 2014 and 2015. Life Science Services has double-digit organic sales growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. On another modeling note, while Life Science products sales growth will be higher in Q4, Life Science Services will experience a tougher comp in Q4, resulting from a very strong Q4 in 2013. And Hitech was flat for the quarter. We had robust growth in the sales of our precursors for the semiconductor industry, which offset the continued decline in LED precursor sales. While our absolute dollar sales of the Hitech business in the second half of the year are expected to be in line with the first half, the comps will be tougher for Hitech in the second half, resulting in double-digit declines. Looking at margins. Gross margin was 51.1% this past quarter, which was 100 basis points higher than Q2 of 2013. The improvement in gross margin came from higher volumes and prices and improved productivity, which more than offset a 50 basis point headwind from unfavorable FX, net of hedging in the quarter. Q2 2014 adjusted operating margin was 26.4% or 30 basis points higher than last year. Improved gross margin and prudent expense control more than offset about 40 basis points of FX headwinds, net of hedges. And in addition, you may recall, we recorded $6 million of asset gains in 2013 that did not repeat in Q2 2014. SG&A expense in the second quarter was $157 million, which was less than our guidance of $160 million to $163 million. With the lower-than-expected sales in the quarter, we were able to manage our discretionary spending, while continuing to invest in growth initiatives. For the remainder of the year, we expect SG&A to be approximately $160 million per quarter. For the full year, we expect to continue to improve adjusted operating margins by about 50 basis points from 2013. We are reaffirming second half 2014 organic sales growth for all 3 of our business units. As Rakesh mentioned, with this reaffirmed second half sales outlook and positive margin trends, we are raising the lower end of our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $4.32 to $4.40, from a prior range of $4.30 to $4.40. In the second half, we expect Research to grow in the low- to mid- single digits; Applied to grow in the mid-single digits; and SAFC Commercial to grow in the mid-single digits, with low single-digit growth in Q3 and high single-digit growth in Q4, given the timing of expected large orders. Given our first half performance, we expect full year 2014 organic sales growth to be in the low single-digit range. Our effective tax rate in 2014 is still expected to be approximately 27%. We expect the third quarter tax rate to be closer to 28%, and the fourth quarter to be about 26%. And for modeling purposes, due to the difference in tax rates between Q3 and Q4, and the timing of SAFC sales, we expect Q3 adjusted EPS to be negatively impacted by a few pennies. Q4 adjusted EPS is expected to be positively impacted by a similar amount. And for the full year, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in excess of $600 million and free cash flow in excess of $475 million. This concludes today's remarks. And operator, we are ready to take questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Paul Knight of Janney Capital. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division Could you talk about the Research business, in that Europe, you said a little slower, or was it the academic environment or was it the clinical market that was slower? Can you flesh out that research commentary? Rakesh Sachdev Sure, Paul. Yes, as I said, in Europe, at least in the first half of the quarter, we saw some slowness, mostly in the academic sector. The pharma sector was fine. And then we saw -- actually June was quite strong back in the same countries, and we've been looking at the trend in July, and it's maintaining its strength. So in relating to [ph] our conversations with our customers on the ground in Europe, it looks like there was some delay in release in funding in some locations, I think that's coming back. So we are a feeling pretty good about the European research [indiscernible] as we have gone into Q3, and expect that, that's going to be stronger than what we saw in Q2. But it was mostly academic. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division And then geographically, in Japan, are you seeing stimulus effect there? Rakesh Sachdev Japan's interesting. Japan has been fairly positive for us. I know we didn't talk a lot about Japan in our opening remarks, but Japan, we are growing in the low single digits. Research probably a little less, but our Commercial business in Japan and even our Applied business has been very, very strong in Japan. Overall, I think Japan, and I don't have the exact numbers, we're growing at about close to 2%, 3%, which is pretty good for Japan. So we are seeing that growth. Operator And our next question comes from Jeff Elliott of Robert Baird. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division First one's on China. You mentioned 15% growth excluding Hitech. Can you talk about -- more on what's driving that growth? I know that some of the other companies are reporting this quarter have talked about delays in funding there. But what's driving that 15% growth? Rakesh Sachdev Yes, so Jeff, I think both the Research business and the Applied business, especially on the Diagnostic side, are growing very robustly. So I would say that our Diagnostics business is playing a lot faster, even. So we, I think we grew close to 15% in Q1. We grew 15% in Q2. When I look at the Research business, that's probably growing in the high-single digits in China. And when I look at our Diagnostics business, it's probably growing in the 20% to 30% range, in Q1 and Q2. So combined, I think they're growing at about 15%. So it's -- China is still looking pretty good for us. I know that there some companies that have reported some issues, but I think we are seeing good strength, at least feel pretty good about China. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Okay, you didn't call it on the press release, but Jan, did you see an impact from the Easter timing shift? I think that's typical days, about a point and a half of growth. Did you see any comment or any impact of that on the quarter? Jan A. Bertsch You are correct, Jeff. I think the quarter had 1 less day, technically, due to the Easter holiday. We don't usually call out plus 1 day, minus 1 day, because it happens frequently for us. But you're also right in thinking that, that impact had about 1 point to 1.5 point percentage growth for the research area. Rakesh Sachdev Lower. Jan A. Bertsch Lower. Right, it's absolutely lower. And then, and the rest of the year is really pretty flat. I believe we have 1 day less in the fourth quarter, but typically, we wouldn't call that out. Operator Our next question comes from Mike Sison of KeyBanc. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division In terms of your outlook for SAFC Commercial, it sounds like you pushed a little bit of your sales into 2015. And you sort of kept the outlook in the second half to some degree. Where did you make it up? or what's coming in a little bit better in the second half that is helping you hit those, hit that outlook? Rakesh Sachdev Yes, I think when we moved on to 2015 was only a little bit, and it came from, really from Q2. I think the back half of the year, for Q3 and Q4, we are still holding, I think, our contract manufacturing, as Jan said, is going to start recovering. Q4 is going to be a very strong quarter for us in contract manufacturing. I think some of the other businesses are doing a little better, too. But what we have said is we are holding our Q3 and Q4 outlook for SAFC. So some business got moved out from Q2 into Q4, and 2015, but the Q3, Q4 stays, still stays in the back half of the year, still stays in the year. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division Okay, great. And then in Applied, certainly, that's been a great strategy and focus there. When you think about the growth rate in that business and heading into maybe a couple of years out, do you think there's a lot of legs in the potential there? Are you, you're just scratching the surface of the opportunities in Applied? Rakesh Sachdev So Mike, I think that's a great question. We are obviously quite encouraged with what we are able to do with the focus that we have created now. We think there are a lot more legs, and frankly, those legs are going to come from continued investment that we are doing in our facilities and critical raw material growth. But frankly, there are also opportunities to looking at bolt-on acquisitions in this space, that look very, very interesting to us. And so I think this area is going to, for us, be a good growth story, both organically, as well as inorganically. And we will certainly bring that to you as we move forward, but we are encouraged. Operator And our next question comes from Tim Evans of Wells Fargo. Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Rakesh, I understand the geographical differences that you talked about in terms of the growth rates in the Research segment. But on an overall basis, the organic constant currency growth there was flat, and that is -- you can compare that to certain peers in the market who are growing mid-single-digits this quarter. I think that may have some -- may make some view it as a share shift type situation. How would you encourage us to look at that? Rakesh Sachdev Yes, so first though, a little reminder -- let me just remind everybody what we are more of a pure consumables company. So where many of the tool companies that have reported also sell instruments and service, and it's kind of all mixed up. And at times, this makes the appropriate comparisons difficult. A good example is sales growth in China. While some of the tools companies have reported significant growth challenges in China, we are quite the opposite. We are seeing a lot of strength. So instead of talking about our competitors, let me just then mention our growth relative to Q1 for you. Our U.S. Research business actually improved about 4 percentage points in the U.S., in Research. Now really what happened was that EMEA and Asia-Pacific sequentially declined about 2 percentage points. And that's where -- that's why we achieved what we did. Now we didn't call on the Easter stuff that Jan just talked about. We are fully expecting 2% to 3% growth in consumables, which is, I think, the market, I can tell you, the markets are growing, probably in the range that we are growing, and we have seen no erosion, nothing as such in -- really, the battlefield is in the U.S. The weakness we saw in Research was really in Asia and certain markets. India has been slow in consumables. The academic piece of our business in India is quite large. And, as you know, we have just put a new budget, with a new prime minister in place, and so we are hopeful there. Korea has been a little bit slow. Again, there are no comparative dynamics in those countries. So I feel pretty good with what we are being able to achieve in Research. I think in the second half of the year, we expect the European strength to come back, and we expect some of the Asia recovery to happen. And I think those 2 alone, and plus with what we are seeing in the U.S., I think a combination of all 3, we're going to see strength in the Research business in all 3 geographies in the second half. Operator Our next question comes from Dan Leonard of Leerink. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Jan, you gave a bunch of modeling notes on the topline, some of which seem favorable to Q3, some Q4. Could you roll those up into an aggregate? Do you expect the Q3 organic revenue growth rate to be better or worse than the rate in Q4? Jan A. Bertsch Yes, the Q3 organic growth rate will lower than Q4. And specifically, SAFC Commercial, because we have some delayed orders that Rakesh had mentioned and I had mentioned, that will be moving from Q2 to Q4, some will be moving from Q2 into 2015, and there will be a couple orders probably moving from Q3 into Q4. So in total, we expect for SAFC Commercial to be down in Q3 and up in Q4. Rakesh Sachdev Yes, I think, just to add to what Jan said, the only real difference will be in SAFC. I think if we look at Research and Applied total, I think Q3 and Q4 growth rates should be fairly similar. It's just the timing on the SAFC sales. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division And my follow-up question, I'm curious why you weren't active on the buyback front in the quarter? Jan A. Bertsch Well, mostly because in the first quarter, if you remember, we had a larger share repurchase program, as compared to a typical quarter for us. So we do not repurchase shares this past quarter. But generally, we repurchase enough shares to offset equity dilution, and we'll continue to monitor the market conditions and adjust our levels as we go forward. But on a year-to-date basis, I think we're in pretty fairly compared to what we've done in the past. Operator Our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC A couple of questions, if I may. Research is still about half of Sigma's sales, and you've done a good job, as Mike pointed out, at growing your Applied business, and then you have some volatility in SAFC that I would like to get to, as well. But how do you get the Research business growing at a rate where you can actually have a chance of, sort of, averaging mid-single-digit growth for your topline, going forward? I mean, is it a matter of internal execution on some of the strategies you're laying in? Or do you need sort of end market cooperation to improve the growth of this largest business unit? Rakesh Sachdev Yes. So for sure, I think the end markets always help, right. But if you put that aside, clearly our strategy is to fire on 3 fronts on the Research business. One is really to continue to drive and expand our product portfolio, and through both innovation, as well as acquiring content. We have a great pipeline into almost every lab around the world, especially with scientists, right. We are not just a pure distribution company. We have great scientific dialogue with our customers. So that is an important leg of a 3-leg stool. I think clearly, the second thing is, expanding our addressable base. So what we are doing in collaborations with institutes and taking that to a higher level, will clearly give us an opportunity to expand the marketplace, and our teams are doing that. We are doing -- and then finally, we are doing a lot more solutions-based workflow selling. Just like in the Applied business, where we took a lot of component strength, and we are now marching down the solution space, which is helping us grow, where we are developing assays with diagnostic companies, we're using a -- we are starting to use a similar approach, even within Research, where we are developing offerings of complete workflows, right. And I know several people are trying to do that. We are in a great position of doing that, because we have such a strong breadth of product offering. Geographically, also, I think there's more to be done from our end. We are certainly doing that . We have got other things that we are doing, we have -- we are launching and have just launched value brand products, which is part of our product expansion in the Asian markets. That is only just beginning. Whereas we are selling products under the Vetec brand in Asia. These are lower price point products, but with the same margins. That opens up markets in Tier 2 markets, and research that typically Sigma-Aldrich did not participate in. So we are expanding our markets, we are expanding our product offerings, we are driving innovation, we are becoming more of a solutions provider to research labs around the world. So it's not just one thing. Our Research business is very diverse, and it takes good, solid execution with our customers globally for us to drive that. And -- but at the end of the day, if the markets help, that helps us even more. Because our plan is to try and grow in excess of the market. And if the markets today, as we all know, in the last couple of years, have been down. But we are all cautiously optimistic that these markets are beginning to show some signs of life, and I think we have to be a little more patient to see how these play out, but I feel pretty good. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC Then, if I may follow-up on it separately on the SAFC division. Typically, in Fine Chemicals businesses, the most volatile part is the contract manufacturing, which is only 15% of your division sales. It sounds like the rest of your businesses should be a little bit more stable. So how do you -- sort of, how do you explain the volatility that we've seen and demand in that businesses? Is it the fact that you're manufacturing, contract manufacturing business is swinging that wildly? Is it that the BioReliance is also a volatile business quarter-to-quarter? Sort of how do you grow this business and smooth out the volatility to where it's -- perhaps becomes a little bit more of a consistent contributor rather than once or twice a year, for 1 or 2 quarters as a positive surprise? Rakesh Sachdev So let me just -- I'll start with the BioReliance business. That is not as lumpy. It's been -- we have been managing that business well and I think that I've mentioned, I think, we have had some very good growth over the last 4 or 5 quarters. I think our growth in Q1, I think, was about 10%, in Q2, we grew 15% or 16%. So I think, clearly, that business, we -- through our working relationship that we have developed with our customers, it feels pretty good. Contract manufacturing, I think that's a little bit of the nature of the beast. We work with our customers many times at the cusp of where they are waiting to get FDA approval for drugs. And in many of these cases, it's only a matter of time before they get FDA approval. But as you can imagine, sometimes there is delay in getting approval. And because, in the contract manufacturing business, unlike our Research or Applied business, where these orders are multimillion dollar orders, if it gets pushed out by a month or 2, it can easily roll into the next quarter. And that's fine. I mean, I -- it's, we know -- we understand that's the nature of the beast. And we just deal with it. But for the most part, Sigma-Aldrich, the rest of the business is highly predictable. It's only a small part of Sigma-Aldrich. But again, it's a great business for us. It's also a business where we develop very strong, strategic ties with our customers, with them and those ties have a spillover to beneficial effects that we have in other parts of our business. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC I appreciate the granularity, Rakesh. I guess that was my point that I'm trying to figure out. I mean, the contract manufacturing is about 15% of your division sales, the other 85% are more predictable, and yet the business, quarter-to-quarter, remains a very volatile business, so that. Rakesh Sachdev Well, because, I mean, when you look at -- if you take our $4 million or $5 million of business from a quarter in from SAFC, it has an impact of 2%, 3% of their growth, and that's what it is. And -- but that's the nature. So I think you've always said, look at SAFC with a slightly longer horizon. Don't look at it over just 1 or 2 or 3 months. Operator Your next question comes from Steven Willougby of Cleveland Research. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company I guess, first, just following up on the SAFC topic. Is there any risk that these order delays possibly get delayed again? Or are these kind of locked in at this point, that you have like shipment dates in the fourth quarter, and things like that? Rakesh Sachdev Yes, I think for what we have outlined for the second half, I think we're locked in. These are orders that are already booked. So that's a statement I made, is not -- these are firm orders. Very rarely will an order get canceled. We usually have visibility before if it's going to be delayed. But I think for -- we are pretty confident in what we have said and what we have, likely to book and sell in contract manufacturing for the second half. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company Okay. And then, just secondly, it's been a little bit since you bought BioReliance. So I just was wondering, I know Jan commented on the share buyback a little bit, but why not increase the buyback here? It doesn't seem like -- you're building quite a bit of cash on the balance sheet now, you haven't been too active with M&A. Why not step up the buyback? Jan A. Bertsch Well, that, we always look at capital allocation kind of in -- as a whole. So we are -- we continue to provide a consistent dividend at about 20% of net income. We continue to look at M&A opportunities, and we do have a rather robust pipeline of those opportunities as we have been, and we continue to look at those. And then share buyback is the third area. And of course, capital deployment within -- for CapEx switch in the company for organic growth. And our typical pattern has been to repurchase shares to offset dilution related to compensation, and at this point, that's what we have been doing this year. That's not to say that's not what we'll continue to do, but we look at our capital deployment for all those items, and make decisions as we go. So we'll continue to look at it and... Rakesh Sachdev That's a fair observation, I mean. We get to the point where we think the opportunities for growth might be delayed or -- than sure. I think none of us only just keep cash sitting in the bank, so. It's a dynamic thing that we keep talking, and we will see how this plays out. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company Okay, and then, I have one more quick one, if you don't mind. Just with where currency exchange rates are right now. When do you expect that the impacts from FX on your margins should start to dissipate, if rates don't move meaningfully from here? Jan A. Bertsch Yes, I mean, if we look at the full year this year, we continue to believe, for the full year, we're probably looking at about a percent impact on the sales line of an FX tailwind. On the EPS line for the full year, it's really very marginal. We don't expect a big impact based on our hedges that we have today on the books. As far as the margin impact, I would say for the full year, probably close to 30 basis points or so. Rakesh Sachdev Headwind. Jan A. Bertsch Headwind. Operator The next question comes from Peter Lawson of Mizuho. Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division Rakesh, just thinking a few years out, and trying to get to like 4% to 5% organic growth or higher. What are the biggest drivers that could potentially get you there? Is that better end markets? Or is it more scale in things like BioReliance or more consistency in around that kind of variable part of the business? Rakesh Sachdev As I said, Peter, if I look at the Applied business and the SAFC business, which is about half of our business, I feel pretty good that the strategy that we are putting in place will -- should give us consistently mid to high single-digit growth. We have more work to do to get that consistency. But I feel pretty good. We are sowing the seeds for doing that. And so, if we are able to do that, which I'm pretty confident, that leaves the Research business, and we have to find a way to consistently grow the Research business in the low- to mid- single-digit growth. And I absolutely think, with the things that we're working on, we will be able to do that. And when we just do the math in that, that easily gets us to the mid-single-digit growth. So that's been our plan all along is, get the mid-single-digit organic growth, we have a great balance sheet to fire our growth through other acquisitions. I think we are actively looking at a pipeline of opportunities. So I think if you look at organic and the inorganic growth that I think we can fire up as a company, it looks like we should be able to produce some good value. Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division And as you look across the portfolio, what spots are you losing share and what spots are you gaining share? Rakesh Sachdev I -- first of all, I don't believe that there's any share shifting in place. If you look at the kind of products that we sell, we have a lot of long-tail products, products that most of our competitors cannot offer. So as by share gains, I think the way we are growing today, faster than the market is. I think we are expanding our market base. We are expanding our market base in Diagnostics, we are expanding our market base in the Industrial markets, we are expanding our product offering base. I think it's a little bit of a myth about changing shares, and that doesn't happen in this industry that easily or quickly, so. But you fire up on the other aspects to drive growth is what we are doing. Operator Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Hey, a question on OpEx. On the slides, you had mentioned that operating margins would have increased 70 bps without the FX headwinds. That would imply incremental margins above 50%. So can you talk to whether that level of incremental margin is sustainable or alternatively, were there one-time things that helped out this quarter? And then, Jan, I know you mentioned some expense controls on the SG&A side, so just wondering whether you're taking a more intense focus on OpEx. Jan A. Bertsch Okay. I really think, Tycho, that Q3 and Q4 margins -- let's just -- let me first just talk about gross margins. Because I think we'll see a little bit difference there, maybe 50.5%, 51%, something like that. One of reasons is, we have some startup cost at our new SAFC facility, and so we expect there to be some incremental cost there. So I think that it'll be a little bit more subdued. In the second quarter, we saw that volume was coming in a little bit light, particularly in SAFC and Research, and we did have some cost control action. So on the SG&A side, I think $160 million is a fair number to assume for both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But we committed to a 50-basis-point reduction in operating margins for the year. Improvement -- I'm sorry, improvement not reduction. And we are clearly on track to deliver that. And I think that's the number that we should be focused on right now. We've got also ERP implementation and some other things. So we'll be investing some of that back into the business. But we should see about a 50 basis point improvement in that margin. Rakesh Sachdev While we also, just to provide more clarity, we have a couple of startups in this year. We are starting up our Irvine, Scotland facility, and we got a start up in Wisconsin and all that is in our forecast, because there's some sort of cost associated with that. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Okay, and then, a second question on pricing. I know I think you talked about expectations for kind of 1% price increase for this year. But maybe just talk a little bit about where you're seeing opportunity and alternatively, where there's been slippage? And within Hitech in particular, as you walked away from lower margin businesses, have you seen any sort of pricing recovery for that market? Rakesh Sachdev Yes, I would say, overall, pricing is, in the industry, is still fairly consistent, where strategically, I think we are able to get somewhere around the 1% pricing in Applied and Research. SAFC, of course, has been -- the pricing story has been on the Hitech, as you know. As I look at the Hitech business, I would say that this year, the pricing for LEDs has been more stable. In fact, if anything, our average selling price in LEDs is actually a little higher for us, because we have walked away from low margin business, away from China. Just to give you a little dimension, I, this, the whole Hitech business is about $100 million business for us. And if I look at what's happening with -- in our LED business, I think we will -- as a combination of walking away from unprofitable business and some of the pricing that has taken place, I think we'll walk away from about $15 million of business this year, compared to last year. But what's interesting is our semiconductor business has been growing with large semiconductor manufacturers in Asia very robustly. We have some great products that's helping them on the advanced semiconductor chips. And it won't entirely offset the decline that I just mentioned on the LED side. But it's getting close to that. This year won't fully offset that, but we will get a big chunk of that through the growth in this semiconductor business. Operator Next question is from Jon Groberg of Macquarie. Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research So Rakesh, just a couple of strategic questions. One, I recognize how difficult it is to figure out what's happening from a share perspective that you alluded to earlier in this space. But just from a big picture standpoint, you've seen your pharma customers consolidate, continue to consolidate, you continue to highlight that. Historically, that's, I mean, that's meant that suppliers will tend to consolidate as well. So, I guess, just how you're thinking about, given you're a student of history and business, kind of how you're thinking about consolidation, either for yourself or just for the industry in general? Rakesh Sachdev Well listen, you asked me 2 questions. One is just on -- first, let me just say, in our business that we do with large pharma customers, especially on the Research side, which is kind of what most people think that scale is going to have an impact on our business. And I keep reminding everybody that only 5%, 8% of our business, only 5% of our business is done with large pharma customers in Research. And I can tell you, we monitor that very carefully. I think our strategy of that business, that business is doing well for us. We've even had some wins. But I'm not that concerned, because we really create value in that 5% of business that we do with the large pharma customers. Your other question about consolidation in the industry. I mean, clearly, I think you've seen and we've all seen, the industry is continuing to consolidate. Not necessarily only on scale, it could be around -- along capabilities, it could be along many different dimensions. I think where companies are trying to build, either leadership in certain technology or certain [indiscernible] maybe certain size. And I think that's going to continue to happen. I think companies are going to have to choose in which dimension they want to gain leadership positions and grow. And we have got a great business model as we have. But we always look at, sort of, are there opportunities for us to even create even more value. And looking at the different dimensions, that would allow us to access more value for our customers. Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research And maybe just as a follow-up, and maybe Jan, you want to chime in, too. If I look at your tax rate, and I think about your cash and I know some of it's overseas, and that obviously there's a lot of discussion around inversion. And as you think about maybe trying to get a little bit larger in certain areas of your business that you think it makes sense. Would you consider any type of inversion or something like that, in order to for you guys, even maybe even lower your rate, but to get access to the cash overseas? Jan A. Bertsch Jon, when we look at M&A opportunities, we always look at them first from a strategic standpoint. So if an M&A opportunity arose that strategically and financially made sense to the company, we would pursue that, with or without an inversion. So what we really focus on is the strategic side. Our tax rate, over the past several years, has come down. This year, it's a little bit higher than last year, primarily because we had some one-time tax benefits in the U.K. last year. We also had 2 years worth of the R&D tax credit. And this year, in our full year 27% effective tax rate, we are assuming no R&D tax credit. So if we do get one of those, that would improve our tax rate by about a half a percentage point for the year. Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research Okay. But just to be clear, if strategically, something made sense in order of the size, it's not something you're completely against doing and [indiscernible]? Jan A. Bertsch We're not, I'm not going to comment on that. It has to financially and strategically make sense for the company as all of our M&A transactions have to. Operator Your next question comes with Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division So not to harp on the research growth rate, but I just want to ask the following question. So your -- I understand you need to have some things go right and markets improving there. I'm just wondering though, do you need to increase your R&D spend? If you sort of look at your numbers the last couple of years, you've spent $69 million in R&D in 2012, and you're going to spend maybe about $66 million in R&D this year. I think you're unusual, and the fact is, you haven't really done much to increase R&D spending. And then I know you're doing collaboration and other things, so I'm just wondering if, is there -- most other companies seem to see some sort of correlation between investing in R&D and growing the product portfolios and growing the organic revenue growth rate. I'm just wondering, if there's as opposed to talking externally, there's more in opportunities for internal advance in the company, investment to company R&D. Rakesh Sachdev Yes, in fact, one of the things that you did mention is the collaborations. So clearly, for the Research business, getting access to product, and whether it's working through collaborations with institutes or working with other companies, we're clearly doing that. Now that doesn't show up in the R&D line. We are doing R&D for Research, but there is no single product that we can develop to -- an innovative R&D engine that would move the needle in research. So we have to do many, many things. Now, frankly, we are spending a lot more in R&D and we are likely to increase our R&D for our Diagnostic and Applied Markets. There we see a much stronger correlation of moving the needle. And that's what's happening. And that's what is beginning to happen in the last several months, as we are exploring even more opportunities. So overall, I think there's clearly room for us to spend more in R&D, and we're likely to do that as, over the next coming quarters. But where we spend R&D dollars will be where we are likely to have the most impact to the company. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Great. And just sort of following up on that. I mean, looks like a little bit about the Diagnostic. I mean, it's a, standards and such as what you're focusing on now, but I mean, Sigma did have a Diagnostics business at one time that was more traditional diagnostics by the time you got out of it. You're going back in now. I guess, how do you see sort of like, is there -- where are sort of the opportunities where Sigma can certainly make a difference? Would you -- is there something you can do in terms of point of care testing? Would you go after more to those markets to expand it? I'm just really curious what should that -- what sort of your Diagnostic strategy is? Rakesh Sachdev Yes, so if you know them, the old traditional Diagnostics would have put us head-to-head with the large diagnostic companies. And that was clearly a strategy that was not the right strategy. You don't want to pursue that. We are now working in partnership with diagnostic manufacturers and diagnostic testing labs. We are helping them develop assays. We're helping them develop point of need tests. Really, we started off by using our separation technologies, our analytical technologies. But clearly, I think we have an ability now to develop complete solutions. Proteomics is one area where we are clearly very focused on, the diagnostic side. We are now trying to get into the gene sequencing platform game. We probably will be a player on the consumable side. But definitely not on the platform side. So, but, so there are clearly areas that are growing, where we will be both a component supplier, whether it's critical raw materials or subsystems or complete systems that we develop, complete assays with these customers. But while things appear to be very powerful about, whether we want to be in, whether we don't -- want, we don't want to be, when we think about the whole diagnostics testing area. Operator And our final question comes from Dan Arias of Citi. Daniel Anthony Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Just one for me. But I actually do need to harp on the Research business. Rakesh, it sounds like you're pretty optimistic about the major geographies all coming back in the back half. So I guess, is that what you need to get to the high end of the low- to mid-singles range? I mean, what needs to happen in order to accelerate from flattish in the first half to 4% or 5% in the back half, just given that comps do get a little bit tougher? Rakesh Sachdev Yes, so again, I think you're right. For us to get to that, to see that improvement, we have to see an improvement in all 3 regions. We are not counting on just 1 region delivering that. So the U.S., I think we are feeling like -- so I think if I will just dimension this for you, Dan, I think the U.S. is likely to contribute about another 1% point growth to the Research business in the second half. I think we have minor sight [ph] there . Europe is probably going to do better than that, with what we are seeing now, in terms of the contribution to the Research growth. And then, so -- between the U.S. and Europe, we will get 2% to 3%. The question is a little bit of a wildcard of the Asia. Now we are up, cautiously optimistic, and if Asia comes through, then clearly we will be able to fire up a little more on the Research side. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Quintin J. Lai Thanks, everybody, for their participation on today's conference call.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Paul Knight of Janney Capital. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division Could you talk about the Research business, in that Europe, you said a little slower, or was it the academic environment or was it the clinical market that was slower? Can you flesh out that research commentary? Rakesh Sachdev Sure, Paul. Yes, as I said, in Europe, at least in the first half of the quarter, we saw some slowness, mostly in the academic sector. The pharma sector was fine. And then we saw -- actually June was quite strong back in the same countries, and we've been looking at the trend in July, and it's maintaining its strength. So in relating to [ph] our conversations with our customers on the ground in Europe, it looks like there was some delay in release in funding in some locations, I think that's coming back. So we are a feeling pretty good about the European research [indiscernible] as we have gone into Q3, and expect that, that's going to be stronger than what we saw in Q2. But it was mostly academic. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division And then geographically, in Japan, are you seeing stimulus effect there? Rakesh Sachdev Japan's interesting. Japan has been fairly positive for us. I know we didn't talk a lot about Japan in our opening remarks, but Japan, we are growing in the low single digits. Research probably a little less, but our Commercial business in Japan and even our Applied business has been very, very strong in Japan. Overall, I think Japan, and I don't have the exact numbers, we're growing at about close to 2%, 3%, which is pretty good for Japan. So we are seeing that growth. Operator And our next question comes from Jeff Elliott of Robert Baird. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division First one's on China. You mentioned 15% growth excluding Hitech. Can you talk about -- more on what's driving that growth? I know that some of the other companies are reporting this quarter have talked about delays in funding there. But what's driving that 15% growth? Rakesh Sachdev Yes, so Jeff, I think both the Research business and the Applied business, especially on the Diagnostic side, are growing very robustly. So I would say that our Diagnostics business is playing a lot faster, even. So we, I think we grew close to 15% in Q1. We grew 15% in Q2. When I look at the Research business, that's probably growing in the high-single digits in China. And when I look at our Diagnostics business, it's probably growing in the 20% to 30% range, in Q1 and Q2. So combined, I think they're growing at about 15%. So it's -- China is still looking pretty good for us. I know that there some companies that have reported some issues, but I think we are seeing good strength, at least feel pretty good about China. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Okay, you didn't call it on the press release, but Jan, did you see an impact from the Easter timing shift? I think that's typical days, about a point and a half of growth. Did you see any comment or any impact of that on the quarter? Jan A. Bertsch You are correct, Jeff. I think the quarter had 1 less day, technically, due to the Easter holiday. We don't usually call out plus 1 day, minus 1 day, because it happens frequently for us. But you're also right in thinking that, that impact had about 1 point to 1.5 point percentage growth for the research area. Rakesh Sachdev Lower. Jan A. Bertsch Lower. Right, it's absolutely lower. And then, and the rest of the year is really pretty flat. I believe we have 1 day less in the fourth quarter, but typically, we wouldn't call that out. Operator Our next question comes from Mike Sison of KeyBanc. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division In terms of your outlook for SAFC Commercial, it sounds like you pushed a little bit of your sales into 2015. And you sort of kept the outlook in the second half to some degree. Where did you make it up? or what's coming in a little bit better in the second half that is helping you hit those, hit that outlook? Rakesh Sachdev Yes, I think when we moved on to 2015 was only a little bit, and it came from, really from Q2. I think the back half of the year, for Q3 and Q4, we are still holding, I think, our contract manufacturing, as Jan said, is going to start recovering. Q4 is going to be a very strong quarter for us in contract manufacturing. I think some of the other businesses are doing a little better, too. But what we have said is we are holding our Q3 and Q4 outlook for SAFC. So some business got moved out from Q2 into Q4, and 2015, but the Q3, Q4 stays, still stays in the back half of the year, still stays in the year. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division Okay, great. And then in Applied, certainly, that's been a great strategy and focus there. When you think about the growth rate in that business and heading into maybe a couple of years out, do you think there's a lot of legs in the potential there? Are you, you're just scratching the surface of the opportunities in Applied? Rakesh Sachdev So Mike, I think that's a great question. We are obviously quite encouraged with what we are able to do with the focus that we have created now. We think there are a lot more legs, and frankly, those legs are going to come from continued investment that we are doing in our facilities and critical raw material growth. But frankly, there are also opportunities to looking at bolt-on acquisitions in this space, that look very, very interesting to us. And so I think this area is going to, for us, be a good growth story, both organically, as well as inorganically. And we will certainly bring that to you as we move forward, but we are encouraged. Operator And our next question comes from Tim Evans of Wells Fargo. Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Rakesh, I understand the geographical differences that you talked about in terms of the growth rates in the Research segment. But on an overall basis, the organic constant currency growth there was flat, and that is -- you can compare that to certain peers in the market who are growing mid-single-digits this quarter. I think that may have some -- may make some view it as a share shift type situation. How would you encourage us to look at that? Rakesh Sachdev Yes, so first though, a little reminder -- let me just remind everybody what we are more of a pure consumables company. So where many of the tool companies that have reported also sell instruments and service, and it's kind of all mixed up. And at times, this makes the appropriate comparisons difficult. A good example is sales growth in China. While some of the tools companies have reported significant growth challenges in China, we are quite the opposite. We are seeing a lot of strength. So instead of talking about our competitors, let me just then mention our growth relative to Q1 for you. Our U.S. Research business actually improved about 4 percentage points in the U.S., in Research. Now really what happened was that EMEA and Asia-Pacific sequentially declined about 2 percentage points. And that's where -- that's why we achieved what we did. Now we didn't call on the Easter stuff that Jan just talked about. We are fully expecting 2% to 3% growth in consumables, which is, I think, the market, I can tell you, the markets are growing, probably in the range that we are growing, and we have seen no erosion, nothing as such in -- really, the battlefield is in the U.S. The weakness we saw in Research was really in Asia and certain markets. India has been slow in consumables. The academic piece of our business in India is quite large. And, as you know, we have just put a new budget, with a new prime minister in place, and so we are hopeful there. Korea has been a little bit slow. Again, there are no comparative dynamics in those countries. So I feel pretty good with what we are being able to achieve in Research. I think in the second half of the year, we expect the European strength to come back, and we expect some of the Asia recovery to happen. And I think those 2 alone, and plus with what we are seeing in the U.S., I think a combination of all 3, we're going to see strength in the Research business in all 3 geographies in the second half. Operator Our next question comes from Dan Leonard of Leerink. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Jan, you gave a bunch of modeling notes on the topline, some of which seem favorable to Q3, some Q4. Could you roll those up into an aggregate? Do you expect the Q3 organic revenue growth rate to be better or worse than the rate in Q4? Jan A. Bertsch Yes, the Q3 organic growth rate will lower than Q4. And specifically, SAFC Commercial, because we have some delayed orders that Rakesh had mentioned and I had mentioned, that will be moving from Q2 to Q4, some will be moving from Q2 into 2015, and there will be a couple orders probably moving from Q3 into Q4. So in total, we expect for SAFC Commercial to be down in Q3 and up in Q4. Rakesh Sachdev Yes, I think, just to add to what Jan said, the only real difference will be in SAFC. I think if we look at Research and Applied total, I think Q3 and Q4 growth rates should be fairly similar. It's just the timing on the SAFC sales. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division And my follow-up question, I'm curious why you weren't active on the buyback front in the quarter? Jan A. Bertsch Well, mostly because in the first quarter, if you remember, we had a larger share repurchase program, as compared to a typical quarter for us. So we do not repurchase shares this past quarter. But generally, we repurchase enough shares to offset equity dilution, and we'll continue to monitor the market conditions and adjust our levels as we go forward. But on a year-to-date basis, I think we're in pretty fairly compared to what we've done in the past. Operator Our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC A couple of questions, if I may. Research is still about half of Sigma's sales, and you've done a good job, as Mike pointed out, at growing your Applied business, and then you have some volatility in SAFC that I would like to get to, as well. But how do you get the Research business growing at a rate where you can actually have a chance of, sort of, averaging mid-single-digit growth for your topline, going forward? I mean, is it a matter of internal execution on some of the strategies you're laying in? Or do you need sort of end market cooperation to improve the growth of this largest business unit? Rakesh Sachdev Yes. So for sure, I think the end markets always help, right. But if you put that aside, clearly our strategy is to fire on 3 fronts on the Research business. One is really to continue to drive and expand our product portfolio, and through both innovation, as well as acquiring content. We have a great pipeline into almost every lab around the world, especially with scientists, right. We are not just a pure distribution company. We have great scientific dialogue with our customers. So that is an important leg of a 3-leg stool. I think clearly, the second thing is, expanding our addressable base. So what we are doing in collaborations with institutes and taking that to a higher level, will clearly give us an opportunity to expand the marketplace, and our teams are doing that. We are doing -- and then finally, we are doing a lot more solutions-based workflow selling. Just like in the Applied business, where we took a lot of component strength, and we are now marching down the solution space, which is helping us grow, where we are developing assays with diagnostic companies, we're using a -- we are starting to use a similar approach, even within Research, where we are developing offerings of complete workflows, right. And I know several people are trying to do that. We are in a great position of doing that, because we have such a strong breadth of product offering. Geographically, also, I think there's more to be done from our end. We are certainly doing that . We have got other things that we are doing, we have -- we are launching and have just launched value brand products, which is part of our product expansion in the Asian markets. That is only just beginning. Whereas we are selling products under the Vetec brand in Asia. These are lower price point products, but with the same margins. That opens up markets in Tier 2 markets, and research that typically Sigma-Aldrich did not participate in. So we are expanding our markets, we are expanding our product offerings, we are driving innovation, we are becoming more of a solutions provider to research labs around the world. So it's not just one thing. Our Research business is very diverse, and it takes good, solid execution with our customers globally for us to drive that. And -- but at the end of the day, if the markets help, that helps us even more. Because our plan is to try and grow in excess of the market. And if the markets today, as we all know, in the last couple of years, have been down. But we are all cautiously optimistic that these markets are beginning to show some signs of life, and I think we have to be a little more patient to see how these play out, but I feel pretty good. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC Then, if I may follow-up on it separately on the SAFC division. Typically, in Fine Chemicals businesses, the most volatile part is the contract manufacturing, which is only 15% of your division sales. It sounds like the rest of your businesses should be a little bit more stable. So how do you -- sort of, how do you explain the volatility that we've seen and demand in that businesses? Is it the fact that you're manufacturing, contract manufacturing business is swinging that wildly? Is it that the BioReliance is also a volatile business quarter-to-quarter? Sort of how do you grow this business and smooth out the volatility to where it's -- perhaps becomes a little bit more of a consistent contributor rather than once or twice a year, for 1 or 2 quarters as a positive surprise? Rakesh Sachdev So let me just -- I'll start with the BioReliance business. That is not as lumpy. It's been -- we have been managing that business well and I think that I've mentioned, I think, we have had some very good growth over the last 4 or 5 quarters. I think our growth in Q1, I think, was about 10%, in Q2, we grew 15% or 16%. So I think, clearly, that business, we -- through our working relationship that we have developed with our customers, it feels pretty good. Contract manufacturing, I think that's a little bit of the nature of the beast. We work with our customers many times at the cusp of where they are waiting to get FDA approval for drugs. And in many of these cases, it's only a matter of time before they get FDA approval. But as you can imagine, sometimes there is delay in getting approval. And because, in the contract manufacturing business, unlike our Research or Applied business, where these orders are multimillion dollar orders, if it gets pushed out by a month or 2, it can easily roll into the next quarter. And that's fine. I mean, I -- it's, we know -- we understand that's the nature of the beast. And we just deal with it. But for the most part, Sigma-Aldrich, the rest of the business is highly predictable. It's only a small part of Sigma-Aldrich. But again, it's a great business for us. It's also a business where we develop very strong, strategic ties with our customers, with them and those ties have a spillover to beneficial effects that we have in other parts of our business. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC I appreciate the granularity, Rakesh. I guess that was my point that I'm trying to figure out. I mean, the contract manufacturing is about 15% of your division sales, the other 85% are more predictable, and yet the business, quarter-to-quarter, remains a very volatile business, so that. Rakesh Sachdev Well, because, I mean, when you look at -- if you take our $4 million or $5 million of business from a quarter in from SAFC, it has an impact of 2%, 3% of their growth, and that's what it is. And -- but that's the nature. So I think you've always said, look at SAFC with a slightly longer horizon. Don't look at it over just 1 or 2 or 3 months. Operator Your next question comes from Steven Willougby of Cleveland Research. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company I guess, first, just following up on the SAFC topic. Is there any risk that these order delays possibly get delayed again? Or are these kind of locked in at this point, that you have like shipment dates in the fourth quarter, and things like that? Rakesh Sachdev Yes, I think for what we have outlined for the second half, I think we're locked in. These are orders that are already booked. So that's a statement I made, is not -- these are firm orders. Very rarely will an order get canceled. We usually have visibility before if it's going to be delayed. But I think for -- we are pretty confident in what we have said and what we have, likely to book and sell in contract manufacturing for the second half. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company Okay. And then, just secondly, it's been a little bit since you bought BioReliance. So I just was wondering, I know Jan commented on the share buyback a little bit, but why not increase the buyback here? It doesn't seem like -- you're building quite a bit of cash on the balance sheet now, you haven't been too active with M&A. Why not step up the buyback? Jan A. Bertsch Well, that, we always look at capital allocation kind of in -- as a whole. So we are -- we continue to provide a consistent dividend at about 20% of net income. We continue to look at M&A opportunities, and we do have a rather robust pipeline of those opportunities as we have been, and we continue to look at those. And then share buyback is the third area. And of course, capital deployment within -- for CapEx switch in the company for organic growth. And our typical pattern has been to repurchase shares to offset dilution related to compensation, and at this point, that's what we have been doing this year. That's not to say that's not what we'll continue to do, but we look at our capital deployment for all those items, and make decisions as we go. So we'll continue to look at it and... Rakesh Sachdev That's a fair observation, I mean. We get to the point where we think the opportunities for growth might be delayed or -- than sure. I think none of us only just keep cash sitting in the bank, so. It's a dynamic thing that we keep talking, and we will see how this plays out. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company Okay, and then, I have one more quick one, if you don't mind. Just with where currency exchange rates are right now. When do you expect that the impacts from FX on your margins should start to dissipate, if rates don't move meaningfully from here? Jan A. Bertsch Yes, I mean, if we look at the full year this year, we continue to believe, for the full year, we're probably looking at about a percent impact on the sales line of an FX tailwind. On the EPS line for the full year, it's really very marginal. We don't expect a big impact based on our hedges that we have today on the books. As far as the margin impact, I would say for the full year, probably close to 30 basis points or so. Rakesh Sachdev Headwind. Jan A. Bertsch Headwind. Operator The next question comes from Peter Lawson of Mizuho. Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division Rakesh, just thinking a few years out, and trying to get to like 4% to 5% organic growth or higher. What are the biggest drivers that could potentially get you there? Is that better end markets? Or is it more scale in things like BioReliance or more consistency in around that kind of variable part of the business? Rakesh Sachdev As I said, Peter, if I look at the Applied business and the SAFC business, which is about half of our business, I feel pretty good that the strategy that we are putting in place will -- should give us consistently mid to high single-digit growth. We have more work to do to get that consistency. But I feel pretty good. We are sowing the seeds for doing that. And so, if we are able to do that, which I'm pretty confident, that leaves the Research business, and we have to find a way to consistently grow the Research business in the low- to mid- single-digit growth. And I absolutely think, with the things that we're working on, we will be able to do that. And when we just do the math in that, that easily gets us to the mid-single-digit growth. So that's been our plan all along is, get the mid-single-digit organic growth, we have a great balance sheet to fire our growth through other acquisitions. I think we are actively looking at a pipeline of opportunities. So I think if you look at organic and the inorganic growth that I think we can fire up as a company, it looks like we should be able to produce some good value. Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division And as you look across the portfolio, what spots are you losing share and what spots are you gaining share? Rakesh Sachdev I -- first of all, I don't believe that there's any share shifting in place. If you look at the kind of products that we sell, we have a lot of long-tail products, products that most of our competitors cannot offer. So as by share gains, I think the way we are growing today, faster than the market is. I think we are expanding our market base. We are expanding our market base in Diagnostics, we are expanding our market base in the Industrial markets, we are expanding our product offering base. I think it's a little bit of a myth about changing shares, and that doesn't happen in this industry that easily or quickly, so. But you fire up on the other aspects to drive growth is what we are doing. Operator Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Hey, a question on OpEx. On the slides, you had mentioned that operating margins would have increased 70 bps without the FX headwinds. That would imply incremental margins above 50%. So can you talk to whether that level of incremental margin is sustainable or alternatively, were there one-time things that helped out this quarter? And then, Jan, I know you mentioned some expense controls on the SG&A side, so just wondering whether you're taking a more intense focus on OpEx. Jan A. Bertsch Okay. I really think, Tycho, that Q3 and Q4 margins -- let's just -- let me first just talk about gross margins. Because I think we'll see a little bit difference there, maybe 50.5%, 51%, something like that. One of reasons is, we have some startup cost at our new SAFC facility, and so we expect there to be some incremental cost there. So I think that it'll be a little bit more subdued. In the second quarter, we saw that volume was coming in a little bit light, particularly in SAFC and Research, and we did have some cost control action. So on the SG&A side, I think $160 million is a fair number to assume for both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But we committed to a 50-basis-point reduction in operating margins for the year. Improvement -- I'm sorry, improvement not reduction. And we are clearly on track to deliver that. And I think that's the number that we should be focused on right now. We've got also ERP implementation and some other things. So we'll be investing some of that back into the business. But we should see about a 50 basis point improvement in that margin. Rakesh Sachdev While we also, just to provide more clarity, we have a couple of startups in this year. We are starting up our Irvine, Scotland facility, and we got a start up in Wisconsin and all that is in our forecast, because there's some sort of cost associated with that. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Okay, and then, a second question on pricing. I know I think you talked about expectations for kind of 1% price increase for this year. But maybe just talk a little bit about where you're seeing opportunity and alternatively, where there's been slippage? And within Hitech in particular, as you walked away from lower margin businesses, have you seen any sort of pricing recovery for that market? Rakesh Sachdev Yes, I would say, overall, pricing is, in the industry, is still fairly consistent, where strategically, I think we are able to get somewhere around the 1% pricing in Applied and Research. SAFC, of course, has been -- the pricing story has been on the Hitech, as you know. As I look at the Hitech business, I would say that this year, the pricing for LEDs has been more stable. In fact, if anything, our average selling price in LEDs is actually a little higher for us, because we have walked away from low margin business, away from China. Just to give you a little dimension, I, this, the whole Hitech business is about $100 million business for us. And if I look at what's happening with -- in our LED business, I think we will -- as a combination of walking away from unprofitable business and some of the pricing that has taken place, I think we'll walk away from about $15 million of business this year, compared to last year. But what's interesting is our semiconductor business has been growing with large semiconductor manufacturers in Asia very robustly. We have some great products that's helping them on the advanced semiconductor chips. And it won't entirely offset the decline that I just mentioned on the LED side. But it's getting close to that. This year won't fully offset that, but we will get a big chunk of that through the growth in this semiconductor business. Operator Next question is from Jon Groberg of Macquarie. Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research So Rakesh, just a couple of strategic questions. One, I recognize how difficult it is to figure out what's happening from a share perspective that you alluded to earlier in this space. But just from a big picture standpoint, you've seen your pharma customers consolidate, continue to consolidate, you continue to highlight that. Historically, that's, I mean, that's meant that suppliers will tend to consolidate as well. So, I guess, just how you're thinking about, given you're a student of history and business, kind of how you're thinking about consolidation, either for yourself or just for the industry in general? Rakesh Sachdev Well listen, you asked me 2 questions. One is just on -- first, let me just say, in our business that we do with large pharma customers, especially on the Research side, which is kind of what most people think that scale is going to have an impact on our business. And I keep reminding everybody that only 5%, 8% of our business, only 5% of our business is done with large pharma customers in Research. And I can tell you, we monitor that very carefully. I think our strategy of that business, that business is doing well for us. We've even had some wins. But I'm not that concerned, because we really create value in that 5% of business that we do with the large pharma customers. Your other question about consolidation in the industry. I mean, clearly, I think you've seen and we've all seen, the industry is continuing to consolidate. Not necessarily only on scale, it could be around -- along capabilities, it could be along many different dimensions. I think where companies are trying to build, either leadership in certain technology or certain [indiscernible] maybe certain size. And I think that's going to continue to happen. I think companies are going to have to choose in which dimension they want to gain leadership positions and grow. And we have got a great business model as we have. But we always look at, sort of, are there opportunities for us to even create even more value. And looking at the different dimensions, that would allow us to access more value for our customers. Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research And maybe just as a follow-up, and maybe Jan, you want to chime in, too. If I look at your tax rate, and I think about your cash and I know some of it's overseas, and that obviously there's a lot of discussion around inversion. And as you think about maybe trying to get a little bit larger in certain areas of your business that you think it makes sense. Would you consider any type of inversion or something like that, in order to for you guys, even maybe even lower your rate, but to get access to the cash overseas? Jan A. Bertsch Jon, when we look at M&A opportunities, we always look at them first from a strategic standpoint. So if an M&A opportunity arose that strategically and financially made sense to the company, we would pursue that, with or without an inversion. So what we really focus on is the strategic side. Our tax rate, over the past several years, has come down. This year, it's a little bit higher than last year, primarily because we had some one-time tax benefits in the U.K. last year. We also had 2 years worth of the R&D tax credit. And this year, in our full year 27% effective tax rate, we are assuming no R&D tax credit. So if we do get one of those, that would improve our tax rate by about a half a percentage point for the year. Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research Okay. But just to be clear, if strategically, something made sense in order of the size, it's not something you're completely against doing and [indiscernible]? Jan A. Bertsch We're not, I'm not going to comment on that. It has to financially and strategically make sense for the company as all of our M&A transactions have to. Operator Your next question comes with Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division So not to harp on the research growth rate, but I just want to ask the following question. So your -- I understand you need to have some things go right and markets improving there. I'm just wondering though, do you need to increase your R&D spend? If you sort of look at your numbers the last couple of years, you've spent $69 million in R&D in 2012, and you're going to spend maybe about $66 million in R&D this year. I think you're unusual, and the fact is, you haven't really done much to increase R&D spending. And then I know you're doing collaboration and other things, so I'm just wondering if, is there -- most other companies seem to see some sort of correlation between investing in R&D and growing the product portfolios and growing the organic revenue growth rate. I'm just wondering, if there's as opposed to talking externally, there's more in opportunities for internal advance in the company, investment to company R&D. Rakesh Sachdev Yes, in fact, one of the things that you did mention is the collaborations. So clearly, for the Research business, getting access to product, and whether it's working through collaborations with institutes or working with other companies, we're clearly doing that. Now that doesn't show up in the R&D line. We are doing R&D for Research, but there is no single product that we can develop to -- an innovative R&D engine that would move the needle in research. So we have to do many, many things. Now, frankly, we are spending a lot more in R&D and we are likely to increase our R&D for our Diagnostic and Applied Markets. There we see a much stronger correlation of moving the needle. And that's what's happening. And that's what is beginning to happen in the last several months, as we are exploring even more opportunities. So overall, I think there's clearly room for us to spend more in R&D, and we're likely to do that as, over the next coming quarters. But where we spend R&D dollars will be where we are likely to have the most impact to the company. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Great. And just sort of following up on that. I mean, looks like a little bit about the Diagnostic. I mean, it's a, standards and such as what you're focusing on now, but I mean, Sigma did have a Diagnostics business at one time that was more traditional diagnostics by the time you got out of it. You're going back in now. I guess, how do you see sort of like, is there -- where are sort of the opportunities where Sigma can certainly make a difference? Would you -- is there something you can do in terms of point of care testing? Would you go after more to those markets to expand it? I'm just really curious what should that -- what sort of your Diagnostic strategy is? Rakesh Sachdev Yes, so if you know them, the old traditional Diagnostics would have put us head-to-head with the large diagnostic companies. And that was clearly a strategy that was not the right strategy. You don't want to pursue that. We are now working in partnership with diagnostic manufacturers and diagnostic testing labs. We are helping them develop assays. We're helping them develop point of need tests. Really, we started off by using our separation technologies, our analytical technologies. But clearly, I think we have an ability now to develop complete solutions. Proteomics is one area where we are clearly very focused on, the diagnostic side. We are now trying to get into the gene sequencing platform game. We probably will be a player on the consumable side. But definitely not on the platform side. So, but, so there are clearly areas that are growing, where we will be both a component supplier, whether it's critical raw materials or subsystems or complete systems that we develop, complete assays with these customers. But while things appear to be very powerful about, whether we want to be in, whether we don't -- want, we don't want to be, when we think about the whole diagnostics testing area. Operator And our final question comes from Dan Arias of Citi. Daniel Anthony Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Just one for me. But I actually do need to harp on the Research business. Rakesh, it sounds like you're pretty optimistic about the major geographies all coming back in the back half. So I guess, is that what you need to get to the high end of the low- to mid-singles range? I mean, what needs to happen in order to accelerate from flattish in the first half to 4% or 5% in the back half, just given that comps do get a little bit tougher? Rakesh Sachdev Yes, so again, I think you're right. For us to get to that, to see that improvement, we have to see an improvement in all 3 regions. We are not counting on just 1 region delivering that. So the U.S., I think we are feeling like -- so I think if I will just dimension this for you, Dan, I think the U.S. is likely to contribute about another 1% point growth to the Research business in the second half. I think we have minor sight [ph] there . Europe is probably going to do better than that, with what we are seeing now, in terms of the contribution to the Research growth. And then, so -- between the U.S. and Europe, we will get 2% to 3%. The question is a little bit of a wildcard of the Asia. Now we are up, cautiously optimistic, and if Asia comes through, then clearly we will be able to fire up a little more on the Research side. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Quintin J. Lai Thanks, everybody, for their participation on today's conference call.

Philip Cusick Do you want to just give us a few minutes on sort of priorities that the Company is working on right now? What are the big issues that you're focused on? James Meyer I think the first issue that we pay a lot of close attention to is our content and obviously it's the reason people pay us and so I think we constantly push ourselves to be improving the bundle of content that we offer constantly. A good example is I think last Wednesday or Thursday, we introduced a exclusive Beatles Channel, which for those in a listeners Channel 18, it’s going to be really, really – it's a very, very good channel. It has been developed fully with the management, the Beatles’ management to develop and it’s just a good example of how we are constantly pushing ourselves. Second is I worry a lot about our position in the car and in particularly our penetration rate in the new car, which is at an all time high in the upper 70s and I really worry about that for two reasons. One, it feeds our first funnel of where new subscriber come from. And second its oxymoron, but I lecture our guys all the timeline, it can't be a used car until it's been a new car and when you think about how big the used car business is in the United States and our rapidly rising penetration rate in that business is giving us a tremendous second funnel to drive growth. And so we worry a lot about those. And the final area, I tell you I worry a lot, a lot, a lot about as our churn. And we spend a lot of time talking about. I meet with our teams almost every week in terms of why customers are leaving us and how we can do a better job keeping them. Philip Cusick Well, let's start on the first one. The new car penetration in the upper 70s, given the sort of skew of sales that are out there for new cars, is that about as high as you can get or as you look down the contract path, can you see even a higher mix there? James Meyer So believe it or not, there are still a lot of carmakers who kind of still sell that lead model with no floor mats and so there is – particularly some of the big U.S. guys, they want an entry level of vehicles that don’t have any features in them and so there is no use trying to push into those. Second, if you get into that $17 million kind of SAAR, there is a chuck of those, I’ll give you an example work events that a plumping company will buy eight of or 10 of, those were never going to get a suppression from, and so we kind – I really see where it is today about where it will stay. If we see an opportunity to increase it, we will and working with the automakers, but we're not pushing it as far as we used to because where it is right now. So for instance in the luxury brands, we are 100% and there's a really good return on our economics there. Philip Cusick And as the electronics in the cars improve over the next few years, talk about where you're going from today sort of standard satellite radio 2 both 360L and connected car, what are the things that are happening there? James Meyer So one of the things I get to do is, we spent a lot of time with the auto industry and a lot of time with various levels of audio executives. I can tell you for instance, there are connected car work, I will tell you for instance with one large Asian OEM, we're already almost signing off the 2022 model year with them, okay, so were that far out. So we have a really good view of what's going on in terms of where the trends are aware, this particular part of technology is going in cars. We don't weigh in on hybrids and electrical and all that stuff. And the one thing I can tell you and I've said it many times, in 2020 the vast majority of new cars built will have an embedded modem in them. And they will have an embedded modem in them really having nothing to do with entertainment. They will have an embedded modem in them for all the things the carmaker wants to do with frankly the number one on the list is over the year software upgrades to the vehicle, which will have a profound impact on their warranty costs, but that modem will also allow an extensive change in the entertainment experience in the vehicle. We've developed a piece of software, which had its sense is a new interface for the vehicle called 360L and the concept in 360L, I’ll give you an example, our headquarters at 49 Street and 6 Avenue, New York. If you were sitting out in front of our building, listening to satellite radio and you say, I really like satellite radio. You're not even getting from a satellite. You're getting it from a terrestrial repeater over a couple blocks and you don't care. All you care is I'm listening to the Highway. In the world going forward, 360L will allow that entertainment experience to shift between our private satellite network, our private terrestrial network and the public wireless networks to significantly enhance both the front-end of our user experience as well as our back-end of our user experience. And many people asking aren’t you really afraid of the connected car? No, I'm not. I mean I actually believe the connected car is really good for our business because frankly that connectivity is going to – we don't give up any of the advantages we have with our very powerful one to many network and we get all of those things that we're lacking in that network like return path data, a direct link to the customer to be able to really simplify our CRM process and our customer process and the opportunity to sell the customer new services. Philip Cusick So let's talk about the path of connected car, can you dig a little deeper into the new model mix of connected car in the next few years? And then also on the use side, you've introduced some products to start to connect some of the used cars out there, how do you see that ecosystem going? James Meyer Well, so I think the connected car business, I think I've been CEO a little over four years. I've been at Sirius almost 13 years and the one lesson I can't ever seem to learn is how slow the OEM cycle go, okay, even when I adjust it to what I think is the right speed, it generally goes lower than what we predict. And a great example of that is if you went back 10 years ago, our incorporation rate of satellite radio in cars was mid-teens or high-teens and now it's high-70s, right. That isn't just driven by the popularity. The product it takes that long to work through the development cycles. The connected vehicle is coming. It's coming in a big way. I think all of you’ve seen with Toyota, Nissan, Fiat Chrysler, and Honda, all of those will be introducing our connected vehicle platform this year. As we speak right now, they’re actually coming in the 2018 model year and we will begin rolling out and then you'll see those platforms rollout across their vehicle lines over the next three to five years. So we're really excited about building a different revenue source there than our current entertainment business. But also we're really excited about the capability that that's going to give us in vehicles to be able to enhance our existing service. Philip Cusick So how you think about those four automakers, the ones that they're launching in 2018, what's the mix of connected versus unconnected in those new model year where you're involved…? James Meyer Most of the OEMs don't like us to speak publicly about their plans. But I can tell you for most of them they're rather modest to where they start, but I can also tell you their plans are to continue ramping up that upgrade over the next three to five years. Philip Cusick If an automaker is launching a new platform 2018 model year is all the vehicles of that line going to be connected or is it sort of a high-end product within that…? James Meyer It is the way the automakers generally do it is they never put all their line at risk at once. And so they generally – they're divided into four increments or five increments where there's new models every year, but each time and so the either only 20% or 25% of the vehicles that convert over of the models. Let’s say sometimes the volume is really, really heavy like the F-150, the number one selling vehicle, when it changes it skews a lot and so at any given time there's usually about 20% of the volume that's being impact. Philip Cusick I'm thinking within that new model car, not – just the F-150 for example with all of the cars within that be connected or would there be sort of a good, better, best as well? James Meyer Well, we're not in the F-150, but right now actually – for some of them it’s actually starting at a lower trim level than you might imagine. It just happened to be the radio platform that was changing in the 2018 model year. It hasn't necessarily been about where it sits in the line and more about where they're changing the platforms over and they can fit this in as they get there. Philip Cusick And what's the opportunity for going back to connecting older cars? You've got a product that can do this… James Meyer Well, it's a great question. Most of you know we made an acquisition about three weeks ago. We announced the acquisition of the Company called Automatic Labs in San Francisco. And the reasons that interest me very much is twofold. One they have a really interesting what I'll call data clearinghouse platform that's geared to the vehicles right and if you want to be – if you want to keep growing in this business, one thing I'm sure of this is going to be a massive amount of data going back and forth between connected vehicles and people who might be interested in that. And so we see a chance to continue to build that platform and then perhaps be able to work with our OEM partners to couple into that platform. As importantly they also have an adapter that allows you to plug in the vehicles. My guess is, there is between 120 million and 150 million of the used cars that are out there right now, do not have any connectivity that this would allow you to go backwards to connect those vehicles, and excites us looking at that opportunity. What we do with it and how we roll it out, we're not ready to say here, but we certainly are looking at the connected vehicle business going forward and going backwards. Philip Cusick And how does that product compare to the one that Verizon has a product, T-Mobile as a product to connect vehicles as well? James Meyer We think it'll be better, but we’ll see and we learn an awful lot about OnStar and what OnStar does and but I want to be clear we have not publicly said what our strategy will be in that space yet, we're still working on. Philip Cusick And as you mentioned that's sort of a new revenue stream, new business model, how does that affect the legacy SiriusXM business? James Meyer Not at all. Philip Cusick Not at all. James Meyer Not at all. Philip Cusick Okay. So let's switch over to 360L, as you start to get those vehicles connected, how do you treat the customer differently? How can you service them better? James Meyer So 360L will begin rolling out in the first half of next year. I'll caution you, it's like a lot of things in the auto industry and I've been very clear on my earnings call, it's a March, not a run and certainly not a sprint. It will go very slowly, very clearly across multiple vehicle manufacturers and multiple vehicle lines, it will take several, several years to build. But it will greatly simplify our relationship with the customer. We've demoed it to a lot of people. There is I think 40 or 50 vehicles out now in operation around the country where we're testing it and using it. But for instance it allows you one touch renewal. You just literally can push a button on the dashboard and renew your subscription, upgrade your subscription, change whatever you want about your subscription with having zero conversation with us. On the other side of it is it allows us to know that you love our country channels particularly the Highway. We noticed you never do listen to our Garth Brooks Channel and so the next communication we send you ought to be about now we have Garth Brooks, we have Kenny Chesney and we have this and why don't you try listening to it or you tell us you're a big God forgive, New England Patriots fan and we know there's a show or a game or whatever and we can immediately alert you them that those things are on. We can't do that in our one way network today, 360L will allow us to really change that experience. Philip Cusick As you think about that March, not the total penetration, but of new cars, do you expect that 360L will eventually have the penetration of new cars that SiriusXM does today? James Meyer I do. What I can and as I told you I admitted my – I confessed my biggest weakness, it will be slower than I think it will be. But what I can tell you is it's been – every OEM we've showed it to has loved it. It's just a matter of where it fits in their development cycles. What’s important by the way, it doesn't add any costs to the vehicle. It obviously is development costs for both us and each OEM as we roll it out, but it needs to go as they rollout their platforms to fit in and so we're busily working on those plans and my guess we will be for several years to come. Philip Cusick Leveraging some level of touch screen that's already there? James Meyer And voice. Philip Cusick And voice, no incremental OpEx, okay. And how does it change how you sort of think about your content? Do you expect to find out that some things are more popular and less than others? James Meyer Well first and foremost I think the biggest thing is it completely takes away any capacity constraints we have. So if today we want to do three additional music channels, we're almost at capacity in our satellite capacity and so we have to generally – when we put other programming up we generally try to either look for programming that's not as popular we can take down. I hate doing that, okay. There's always somebody who loves the channel we take down…. Philip Cusick You mentioned the 40s channel? James Meyer Yes, we took the 40s channel down and I thought if you're listening to 40s channel maybe you should need to be driving, but that ended up not being correct, trust me I got more. By the way I got more e-mail campaigns and online campaigns by people of the 40s channel you can imagine. With this connectivity coming, we can have as many channels as we want. We can also change our service. I'll give you an example. We have lots of talk content today, it's great. We have a great channel called Doctor Radio and how many of you listen to it? But it's linear. When you want to hear the chart the channel on men's prostate health, it needs to be on and you happen to be – need to be in the car when it's on. In the 360L, where we're going to be able to push a button and we can give it to you on demand, it's going to change our entertainment experience a lot. More importantly that we’re also going to be able to customize that entertainment experience to you based on what you tell us your preferences are. I will tell you one thing though, I talked to a lot of young people and they're always telling me they want to go this way and that way and all that stuff. Most of our subscribers I talk to asked me one thing. Hey, can you make it even easier for me to use. And so at it’s heart, the one thing that I've just driven through our organization 360L has to be simple, simple, simple to use and that's really the starting premise of it. Philip Cusick That's interesting. Let's open it up to the audience. If you have a question there's a mic that can come around, please raise your hand and I'd be happy to calling you. While we wait to see if anybody has a question, let me ask you about churn. You mentioned that as one of the big places that you focus. What are the things a) that are going well and improving over the last year and b) what do you worry about on the churn side? James Meyer So our number one, two, three and four and five reason for why people churn is pretty simple. I don't want to pay, I don't want to pay, I don't want to pay, I don't want to pay, I don't want to pay, okay. So of course there is – you took a channel off I don't like, but it's way over here and our primary competition without question is free and by the way everybody gets all excited about all of the streaming stuff, our primary competition I will tell you is terrestrial radio today without question. And when I talk to people who have left us and want to understand why they left us. Most of them either say, I don't want to pay or frankly you never gave me enough reason for me to pay. And when I say where would you go? They almost all went back to their local AM and FM station, okay. And they complain about it whether on the phone, they don't really like it, but we haven't given them a good enough reason. We've given 32 million people a good enough reason to pay us, okay. And so our churn has been really, really steady between 1.8% and 2% a month. That number is particularly impressive, ladies and gentlemen it includes turnover of the vehicle. So if you’re a subscriber and you bought a new car, okay, in our model you’re a subscriber, you're a churner, you're a trailer, and then you’re subscriber again, right because you change vehicles and we can't necessarily match you up as well as we would like to in that system. So a big part of our churn has sold my car, okay. That's going to get bigger and bigger and bigger over time and we’re – our team is really, really focused and what we're getting so much more sophisticated is to ask ourselves two questions every time that happens. Number one where did you go when you sold your vehicle? And in fact did we find you – almost overwhelming that you bought another car and where we able to simply transition you from that car to this car and keep our subscription relationship with you. That's the first question we ask ourselves. And what's important today, we also say what happened to that car you sold? Where did it go? Who bought it and how do we establish a relationship with them? And so this natural turnover while I don't worry about it. We can't stop it. I think actually is going to give us a much bigger opportunity and getting second and third owners. When you go to the fundamentals of our business where you measure the impact potentially of competition and there I mean voluntary and non-voluntary churn, frankly we're operating right now as good levels that I've seen in 13 years and so I'm pretty pleased with it. Philip Cusick Let's go to the question. Question-and-Answer Session Q - Unidentified Analyst Hi. James Meyer Hi. Unidentified Analyst You and David have been skeptical about streaming services in the past, has anything changed in that respect? James Meyer Well, I don't know that I've been skeptical about streaming. I want to be clear, I love streaming as a technology. It's one of the arguments, I work for Mel Karmazin for eight years, but I love working for Mel. But Mel saw streaming as a competitor. I see streaming as a technology and the rules vote it, right. I mean there's not a human in the world don’t have one of these, okay. And so we shouldn't care how customers listen. We should only care that they listen and pay us. And so I don't care, which device they listen to. I only care that they listen. The streaming businesses today I think have challenged economics and what we keep asking ourselves is, if we were to get involved in one of those businesses, how can we change that equation perhaps in a way that would be beneficial for our shareholders? That's a tough question. I love spotify. I read about them all the time. I use their product all the time. At some point, they're going to have to make money. And I'm not sure how easy that's really going to be, right. And so those business models challenge us. The other thing we're really careful, and I want to be clear here and maybe we're not getting it right, but we think we really are seeing it crystal clear. We don't want to be in the music distribution business. Music has been distributed for 50 years. There are records and then eight tracks and then cassettes and then CDs and then downloads, and now downloads being replaced perhaps by $10 a month, let’s call it a lease business. Those are different than the business we’re in. We’re in the radio business. We’re not in the music distribution business. We want to be careful with jumping over that void. Now I will tell you one thing. We're spending a lot of money on streaming. We're spending a lot of money – we have a big team working on significantly improving our apps and significantly improving the services that are available on those apps. And the day our customers say to us, hey Jim, I know you drew this line between these $10 services and something else. I expect to get that from you. We’ll have to give it to them. We’ll go develop that service and provide it to them. Unidentified Analyst When you stream your service, you confirm to the CRB rates that are relevant to your satellite service or do the CRB rates that are set by the SoundExchange for webcasting? James Meyer Our streaming product complies with the SoundExchange for webcast. Unidentified Analyst With some of the deals that have been done recently for webcasting at very high rates, does that have any relationship to your upcoming CRB discussions? James Meyer Not that we see at all, no. Unidentified Analyst Okay, thanks. Philip Cusick There was one here. Unidentified Analyst While you walkover, let's follow-up on the advertising model. Those streaming services are all driven by advertising, but your advertising business has been ramping up as well. What is the ad load on your product today and how are you selling it and how do you expect it to grow? James Meyer Well, I mean we don't have any ads on our music channels and at least as long as I’m in-charge we never well, okay. Our customers value commercial free in music and we need to protect that value equation with customers everywhere we can. On our talk channels, we do sell ads and frankly it's necessary because there are natural breaks in talk channels. I'll give example Howard Stern, he needs to take a break every so often and we run those ads when he's on break. Our ad business today is I think in the $140 million range, our total revenues in the $5.3 billion range. So it's 2% of our revenue growing to 3%. I’d love to grow it one day to 5% of our revenue. I don't know whether we'll be able to do that or not, okay. And so it's funny I just spoke to our whole ad sales force last week until now great, everything is and they are, they're growing double-digit and I love it. But our primary way to make money is subscriptions and our primary way to make money going forward will be subscriptions. Philip Cusick Okay, the question for you. Unidentified Analyst Yes, I was just curious your thoughts on trends around vehicle sharing, autonomous vehicles, vehicle ownership and how that's going to impact the business going forward? James Meyer Yes. I think it's going to change probably a little slower than some of you might think. But I certainly believe it could have an impact on how many cars there are in the U.S. or the world one day. Frankly we only care about North America. Our business is very North American centric both U.S. and Canada. So that's really all we worry about. There is the beginning of macro trends, which you just identified, which is more young people and older people coming back from the suburbs into the cities, more of them saying right, sharing works for me. On the flipside, I'll tell you I got three kids, when everyone of them graduate from college, what would you like they all want a car, right. And so I'm kind of waiting to see that balance. We certainly don't see it having a meaningful impact in the next three to five years and we base that on both our own knowledge as well as the various – I know there's any given time 20 different forecasts out there from experts and banks and what's going to happen to the SAAR, inevitably it has to have some impact on it. Unidentified Analyst Can you talk about your penetration in the home and your strategy there and then your overall kind of medium-term growth rate, how you grow revenue? James Meyer So we dominate in car listening today and when someone subscribes our service, I can tell you they just mostly listen to SiriusXM and frankly they go back mostly for local weather, local sports, local news is why they go back to their terrestrial station. This is one of the things I'm so excited about connectivity for. I don't know how many of you owned our – I’ll probably get killed for them, but how many of you owned our products like five years ago, if you wanted to listen to our product from the satellite you had to buy a boombox and put a little antenna. I mean we made some really clever products, but let's face it, that's not what you've got to be a really passionate fan to do that. Now you can just take this device or your tablet and work it right through your home entertainment system. So and we announced in our earnings call last quarter, a huge increase in the amount of aftermarket devices were now available on, things like Sony Play Station almost every Smart TV and I can tell you there is more to come in the next 30 days in a big way. And so our goal is to get you to listen more everywhere and we're going to work a lot harder on that and think about it. It's almost like the same as 360L, if we can get you to listen more at home through a connected environment, we get some of those same benefits I talk to you about that we want to go in the car. If we know you listen to the highway at home, it's a pretty good bass, you listen to the highway in the car, which gives us a little bit more knowledge about you to help us better experience what we offer to you to try to make you more sticky and a better listener. So I think you will see more and more focus for us improving our streaming products and more and more focus on us trying to lift up the amount in-home listenership we get as well, without losing our position in the car. When I say in the car, I mean when you work out in the car, where those might be. I can't hear you ma'am sorry. Growth, so number one, I will tell you I expect us to have subscriber growth as far as I can see. It gets harder and harder when we had 20 million customers, let's make it easier and churn rate was 2% that means we had to make up 400,000 a month to grow. Now we have 30 million for churns to now we're going to make up 600,000 just to stay easy. If you got to 40 million and that would be 800,000, so and you see it with a lot of big Pay-TV services and a lot of the wireless guys, it gets harder and harder to offset that churn. That said we see subscriber growth for many years to come, which means we see revenue growth for many years to come and obviously EBITDA growth for many years to come. We haven't given a forecast beyond this year. Philip Cusick Let me follow-up on the first question and you mentioned when customers have to demand that there's going to streaming product within your application you’ll need to provide it? What our customers telling you today, do they want that today? James Meyer Today, they don't tell us they want it. It's very, very interesting as I told you, I keep waiting only talk to customers and for them to say what I really want there's a spotify like experience. That's not what we're hearing and I mean I can’t be emphatic enough here. But most of them are saying is I'm just not going to pay. Philip Cusick They want to curious radio type… James Meyer That's what they want. In our customers love our curation and not to bore, I had a root canal yesterday morning and my dentist is an avid – this guy is an avid listener of SiriusXM, and talking about everyone of our channels while he's working away and of course, I can't answer, right. So – but he came back and when he came back to me as I love the curation and the way you do it, about say some interesting about him, which is interesting about our customers., if you got his age, he was 59 or 60 years old, okay, affluent obviously gets a charge dentist rates, right and he loves classic vinyl and those kind of channels and yet, it's always that fifth when we never get right that makes our service work. He loves Broadway show tunes. We would have never been able to guess that was something that he loved and I find that more and more as subscribers, we know a little bit about their age and a little bit about where they live or what they do. We can get their three or four first channels right. It's always that fifth one that completely surprises us where they discover something they don't think they can get somewhere else. Philip Cusick I thinking in mind, top 20. James Meyer What’s it? Philip Cusick Top 20, line them up, all right, good. Let's talk a little bit more about the used opportunity and then we'll finish it up. As you think about growing into that big sort of used base, what are the couple of things that are really on the focus for the next year that you need to change, you can continue to drive that? James Meyer So I want to be clear – my message to the investors is clear. Our penetration in these used cars is just math, okay. I mean and again as I said earlier, it can't be a used car until it's been a new car. If we continue at our high-70s penetration, 17 million kind of SAAR, okay. There's more than double that used car sold. And so eventually, those two penetration rates have to catch up, right. So our opportunities for trials from the used car should double over the next five to 10 years and it’s just math, okay. I mean really it’s just math. Well then what's so complicated about? There are two things that are very complicated about it. One is in a new business, not only is our relationship with the auto is important because they install our technology, but they also send us a sold record like you buy a car on Saturday, we get that sold record with your name, address, and phone number almost immediately so we can begin marketing to you, okay. That's really, really powerful. In the used market, they don't get that data, okay. And so we're now out building all that data. Today we have 25,000 dealers that report to us every day. Here are the cars we took in on trade that have satellite radio and then in the evening they send us a data saying, here is all the cars we sold today with satellite radio. Here is a name, address, and phone number. That's still not good enough to be able to get as big amount of data as we want. And so when you buy a new car, for you it's a new car, but a used car, right, generally most of them are financed, generally most of them are insured, so now we're working with finance companies and insurance companies to get that owner data as well. And I'll tell you the area where we're really finding to be very fertile is service locations, places like oil change shops, places tire shops, places like that where they actually do record the car by VIN number and the name and the car comes in and we're really making a lot of progress. I think today we have over 14,000 of those locations reports. So the first thing that's necessary to drive the used business, we have to know who bought that vehicle and be able to market them in a timely basis. The second challenge is going to be a little tougher and that is the demographic of those buyers is going to be different, okay. Today our average subscribers in their upper 40s and makes $115,000 a year. Obviously that doesn't describe America, right. Americas obviously younger than that and not as wealthy as that. And so as more and more used car buyers come to us, we're going to have to very, very smartly and very, very carefully manage that value equation for them as we transition and that content equation, okay. And so for instance a car that's on its third owner and might be 10 or 11 years only has two years left or three years left, we might have a very different approach for selling a subscription in that vehicle than we do some who just bought a brand new car that's got 12 years a life or whatever, 14 or whatever it maybe. Also there's a variety of pricing tradeoffs in there that will need to make as we try to go after a lower demographic and we need to be very careful. That's why when I say it's going to be done very, very carefully and very, very systematically that we don't disrupt this big base that we have that's paying us almost $16 a month today right. So I'm really excited about it. We have a great CMO, Kathy Thomson joined us a couple of years ago. This is a huge amount of our focus as we understand those tradeoffs and I can assure investors that will be all over this for many, many years to come to maximize not just the yield of this funnel the use funnel or not just the yield of the new funnel, but how do we maximize both of those yields to generate the most revenue and EBITDA.

Unidentified Analyst You and David have been skeptical about streaming services in the past, has anything changed in that respect? James Meyer Well, I don't know that I've been skeptical about streaming. I want to be clear, I love streaming as a technology. It's one of the arguments, I work for Mel Karmazin for eight years, but I love working for Mel. But Mel saw streaming as a competitor. I see streaming as a technology and the rules vote it, right. I mean there's not a human in the world don’t have one of these, okay. And so we shouldn't care how customers listen. We should only care that they listen and pay us. And so I don't care, which device they listen to. I only care that they listen. The streaming businesses today I think have challenged economics and what we keep asking ourselves is, if we were to get involved in one of those businesses, how can we change that equation perhaps in a way that would be beneficial for our shareholders? That's a tough question. I love spotify. I read about them all the time. I use their product all the time. At some point, they're going to have to make money. And I'm not sure how easy that's really going to be, right. And so those business models challenge us. The other thing we're really careful, and I want to be clear here and maybe we're not getting it right, but we think we really are seeing it crystal clear. We don't want to be in the music distribution business. Music has been distributed for 50 years. There are records and then eight tracks and then cassettes and then CDs and then downloads, and now downloads being replaced perhaps by $10 a month, let’s call it a lease business. Those are different than the business we’re in. We’re in the radio business. We’re not in the music distribution business. We want to be careful with jumping over that void. Now I will tell you one thing. We're spending a lot of money on streaming. We're spending a lot of money – we have a big team working on significantly improving our apps and significantly improving the services that are available on those apps. And the day our customers say to us, hey Jim, I know you drew this line between these $10 services and something else. I expect to get that from you. We’ll have to give it to them. We’ll go develop that service and provide it to them. Unidentified Analyst When you stream your service, you confirm to the CRB rates that are relevant to your satellite service or do the CRB rates that are set by the SoundExchange for webcasting? James Meyer Our streaming product complies with the SoundExchange for webcast. Unidentified Analyst With some of the deals that have been done recently for webcasting at very high rates, does that have any relationship to your upcoming CRB discussions? James Meyer Not that we see at all, no. Unidentified Analyst Okay, thanks. Philip Cusick There was one here. Unidentified Analyst While you walkover, let's follow-up on the advertising model. Those streaming services are all driven by advertising, but your advertising business has been ramping up as well. What is the ad load on your product today and how are you selling it and how do you expect it to grow? James Meyer Well, I mean we don't have any ads on our music channels and at least as long as I’m in-charge we never well, okay. Our customers value commercial free in music and we need to protect that value equation with customers everywhere we can. On our talk channels, we do sell ads and frankly it's necessary because there are natural breaks in talk channels. I'll give example Howard Stern, he needs to take a break every so often and we run those ads when he's on break. Our ad business today is I think in the $140 million range, our total revenues in the $5.3 billion range. So it's 2% of our revenue growing to 3%. I’d love to grow it one day to 5% of our revenue. I don't know whether we'll be able to do that or not, okay. And so it's funny I just spoke to our whole ad sales force last week until now great, everything is and they are, they're growing double-digit and I love it. But our primary way to make money is subscriptions and our primary way to make money going forward will be subscriptions. Philip Cusick Okay, the question for you. Unidentified Analyst Yes, I was just curious your thoughts on trends around vehicle sharing, autonomous vehicles, vehicle ownership and how that's going to impact the business going forward? James Meyer Yes. I think it's going to change probably a little slower than some of you might think. But I certainly believe it could have an impact on how many cars there are in the U.S. or the world one day. Frankly we only care about North America. Our business is very North American centric both U.S. and Canada. So that's really all we worry about. There is the beginning of macro trends, which you just identified, which is more young people and older people coming back from the suburbs into the cities, more of them saying right, sharing works for me. On the flipside, I'll tell you I got three kids, when everyone of them graduate from college, what would you like they all want a car, right. And so I'm kind of waiting to see that balance. We certainly don't see it having a meaningful impact in the next three to five years and we base that on both our own knowledge as well as the various – I know there's any given time 20 different forecasts out there from experts and banks and what's going to happen to the SAAR, inevitably it has to have some impact on it. Unidentified Analyst Can you talk about your penetration in the home and your strategy there and then your overall kind of medium-term growth rate, how you grow revenue? James Meyer So we dominate in car listening today and when someone subscribes our service, I can tell you they just mostly listen to SiriusXM and frankly they go back mostly for local weather, local sports, local news is why they go back to their terrestrial station. This is one of the things I'm so excited about connectivity for. I don't know how many of you owned our – I’ll probably get killed for them, but how many of you owned our products like five years ago, if you wanted to listen to our product from the satellite you had to buy a boombox and put a little antenna. I mean we made some really clever products, but let's face it, that's not what you've got to be a really passionate fan to do that. Now you can just take this device or your tablet and work it right through your home entertainment system. So and we announced in our earnings call last quarter, a huge increase in the amount of aftermarket devices were now available on, things like Sony Play Station almost every Smart TV and I can tell you there is more to come in the next 30 days in a big way. And so our goal is to get you to listen more everywhere and we're going to work a lot harder on that and think about it. It's almost like the same as 360L, if we can get you to listen more at home through a connected environment, we get some of those same benefits I talk to you about that we want to go in the car. If we know you listen to the highway at home, it's a pretty good bass, you listen to the highway in the car, which gives us a little bit more knowledge about you to help us better experience what we offer to you to try to make you more sticky and a better listener. So I think you will see more and more focus for us improving our streaming products and more and more focus on us trying to lift up the amount in-home listenership we get as well, without losing our position in the car. When I say in the car, I mean when you work out in the car, where those might be. I can't hear you ma'am sorry. Growth, so number one, I will tell you I expect us to have subscriber growth as far as I can see. It gets harder and harder when we had 20 million customers, let's make it easier and churn rate was 2% that means we had to make up 400,000 a month to grow. Now we have 30 million for churns to now we're going to make up 600,000 just to stay easy. If you got to 40 million and that would be 800,000, so and you see it with a lot of big Pay-TV services and a lot of the wireless guys, it gets harder and harder to offset that churn. That said we see subscriber growth for many years to come, which means we see revenue growth for many years to come and obviously EBITDA growth for many years to come. We haven't given a forecast beyond this year. Philip Cusick Let me follow-up on the first question and you mentioned when customers have to demand that there's going to streaming product within your application you’ll need to provide it? What our customers telling you today, do they want that today? James Meyer Today, they don't tell us they want it. It's very, very interesting as I told you, I keep waiting only talk to customers and for them to say what I really want there's a spotify like experience. That's not what we're hearing and I mean I can’t be emphatic enough here. But most of them are saying is I'm just not going to pay. Philip Cusick They want to curious radio type… James Meyer That's what they want. In our customers love our curation and not to bore, I had a root canal yesterday morning and my dentist is an avid – this guy is an avid listener of SiriusXM, and talking about everyone of our channels while he's working away and of course, I can't answer, right. So – but he came back and when he came back to me as I love the curation and the way you do it, about say some interesting about him, which is interesting about our customers., if you got his age, he was 59 or 60 years old, okay, affluent obviously gets a charge dentist rates, right and he loves classic vinyl and those kind of channels and yet, it's always that fifth when we never get right that makes our service work. He loves Broadway show tunes. We would have never been able to guess that was something that he loved and I find that more and more as subscribers, we know a little bit about their age and a little bit about where they live or what they do. We can get their three or four first channels right. It's always that fifth one that completely surprises us where they discover something they don't think they can get somewhere else. Philip Cusick I thinking in mind, top 20. James Meyer What’s it? Philip Cusick Top 20, line them up, all right, good. Let's talk a little bit more about the used opportunity and then we'll finish it up. As you think about growing into that big sort of used base, what are the couple of things that are really on the focus for the next year that you need to change, you can continue to drive that? James Meyer So I want to be clear – my message to the investors is clear. Our penetration in these used cars is just math, okay. I mean and again as I said earlier, it can't be a used car until it's been a new car. If we continue at our high-70s penetration, 17 million kind of SAAR, okay. There's more than double that used car sold. And so eventually, those two penetration rates have to catch up, right. So our opportunities for trials from the used car should double over the next five to 10 years and it’s just math, okay. I mean really it’s just math. Well then what's so complicated about? There are two things that are very complicated about it. One is in a new business, not only is our relationship with the auto is important because they install our technology, but they also send us a sold record like you buy a car on Saturday, we get that sold record with your name, address, and phone number almost immediately so we can begin marketing to you, okay. That's really, really powerful. In the used market, they don't get that data, okay. And so we're now out building all that data. Today we have 25,000 dealers that report to us every day. Here are the cars we took in on trade that have satellite radio and then in the evening they send us a data saying, here is all the cars we sold today with satellite radio. Here is a name, address, and phone number. That's still not good enough to be able to get as big amount of data as we want. And so when you buy a new car, for you it's a new car, but a used car, right, generally most of them are financed, generally most of them are insured, so now we're working with finance companies and insurance companies to get that owner data as well. And I'll tell you the area where we're really finding to be very fertile is service locations, places like oil change shops, places tire shops, places like that where they actually do record the car by VIN number and the name and the car comes in and we're really making a lot of progress. I think today we have over 14,000 of those locations reports. So the first thing that's necessary to drive the used business, we have to know who bought that vehicle and be able to market them in a timely basis. The second challenge is going to be a little tougher and that is the demographic of those buyers is going to be different, okay. Today our average subscribers in their upper 40s and makes $115,000 a year. Obviously that doesn't describe America, right. Americas obviously younger than that and not as wealthy as that. And so as more and more used car buyers come to us, we're going to have to very, very smartly and very, very carefully manage that value equation for them as we transition and that content equation, okay. And so for instance a car that's on its third owner and might be 10 or 11 years only has two years left or three years left, we might have a very different approach for selling a subscription in that vehicle than we do some who just bought a brand new car that's got 12 years a life or whatever, 14 or whatever it maybe. Also there's a variety of pricing tradeoffs in there that will need to make as we try to go after a lower demographic and we need to be very careful. That's why when I say it's going to be done very, very carefully and very, very systematically that we don't disrupt this big base that we have that's paying us almost $16 a month today right. So I'm really excited about it. We have a great CMO, Kathy Thomson joined us a couple of years ago. This is a huge amount of our focus as we understand those tradeoffs and I can assure investors that will be all over this for many, many years to come to maximize not just the yield of this funnel the use funnel or not just the yield of the new funnel, but how do we maximize both of those yields to generate the most revenue and EBITDA.

Our comparable sales measure excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, store closures and changes in foreign currency translation. Please see the financial measures and other data section of investor.staples.com for a reconciliation of non-GAAP metrics and recast historical results to reflect all of our businesses outside of North America as discontinued operations.

Here to discuss Staples’ Q4 performance and outlook are Shira Goodman, Chief Executive Officer; and Christine Komola, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Jeff Hall, our Vice Chairman. Shira. Shira Goodman Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced our Q1 2017 results. Starting on Slide 3, let’s take a look at the headlines. Comparable sales in Staples business advantage our North American contract business grew 1%. This reflects a stable trend on the two year stack basis as our year-over-year comparison in Q1 was about two points more difficult in Q4. Consistent with our strategy, we once again drove solid sales growth in our mid-market contract business with sales up 10% year-over-year including a 7% tailwind from our acquisition of capital office products. We grew operating income in North American retail for the first time since Q2 2015. We achieved our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.17, which was right in-line with our expectations and we recently launched a new brand campaign Pro Time that celebrates our target customers and communicates in many ways that Staples is already a solution provider for businesses of all sizes. Turning to Slide 4, last week we marched the one year anniversary of launching Staples 2020, which is a multi-year transformational change of our strategy, our operating model and our mindset. I'm proud of the team for all that we have accomplished over the past year. we are increasingly focused on building relationships with business customers and at the same time, we have reducing our exposure to customers who are more transaction oriented and place less value on the services and expertise that we provide. Just as a reminder, Staples 2020 has four priorities. One accelerate growth in the mid-market in North America. Two, preserve profitability in our North American stores, while rationalizing excess capacity. Three, take aggressive actions to drive profit improvements and reduce cost across the Company, and four narrow our geographic focus to North America. We made great progress on each of these priorities during Q1. Let's start with mid-market growth on Page 5. Staple's business advantage remains the cornerstone of our long-term growth strategy, and the mid-market contract business once again led the way during Q1 as we continue to build momentum on our two key mid-market growth metrics. Membership customers, and sales beyond office supply. We acquired a record 34,000 new membership customers bringing the total to 91,000 and we drove strong growth in the mid-market in categories beyond office supplies with sales up 12% year-over-year including a five points tailwind from capital office products. Moving to Slide 6. In North America retail we are focused on preserving profitability. Operating income was up $4 million versus Q1 of last year. We continue to take a more disciplined approach to our promotional strategy and we also made good progress driving our three key retail metrics, customer conversion, services growth and store count. Customer conversion in our U.S. stores increased 300 basis points year-over-year. Our highly profitability print-to-marketing business continues to significantly outpace the house with same-store sales down about 1% year-over-year and we continue to reduce excess capacity with 18 stores closing during Q1. Turning to Slide 7, we remain on-track with our multi-year cost savings plan, our goal is to take out $100 million of cost in 2017 and we made good progress here during the quarter. We reduced end-to-end product cost and continues to evolve our promotional strategies both of which supported our improved gross margin rates year-over-year. We also drove efficiency savings across the organization in areas like systems, marketing and store operations. And finally we substantially narrowed our geographic focus to North America. We have closed the sale of a controlling interest in our European peculations in late February and we closed the sale of our businesses in Australia and New Zealand in late April and we are now pursuing the sale of our remaining smaller businesses outside of North America. Let’s turn to Slide 9. Now, that we have successfully narrowed our geographic footprint to North America, we are evolving our Staples 2020 strategy and increasing our focus on several growth categories. These categories include facilities, break room, furniture, technology solutions and promotional products of what we are now referring to as Pro categories. So our new Staples 2020 strategic plan is to accelerate Pro Category growth with business customers of all sizes. Today, about half of our North American delivery sales already come from this pro categories. So we are pursuing this opportunity from a position of strength and while these categories aren’t branded new for us, we are increasing our investment and our focus on them. Going forward, we plan to increase our number of Pro Category specialists, broaden our Pro Category assortment and enhance the digital customer experience when shopping and buying pro categories. You can look to our success growing facilities supplies as a great example of what we are capable of achieving in pro categories. We have had tremendous success, built in scale and credibility in the facility supply and achieved double-digit growth in each of the last six years. We know that business customers of all sizes value the product, the services and expertise that we provide and we are applying to lessons we learnt in facility supplies to each of our pro categories. And perhaps what is most attractive is that the market for pro categories is extremely large and fragmented. Today, Staples is already a market leader in each of these categories, but our market share in the low single-digits and most of our customers still don’t source these products from us. So we are extremely well positioned to continue gaining share in pro categories as we increase our focus on them. Consistent with this, last week we launched a new brand campaign that repositions how we convey the value and benefits Staples delivers to customers. Reinforces our strength in Pro Category and clearly articulates that Staples is a solutions partner for businesses of all sizes. Our new campaign Stapes its Pro Time emphasizes that Staples already combines the product and services and expertise that enable the workplace to work. In short, we are looking to better communicate and get credit for what we already do so well today. And turning to Slide 11, with the addition of our Pro Category strategic plan, we are increasingly confident that we will achieve our Staples 2020 goals for more than 80% of our sales to be delivered and more than 60% of our sales to come from core categories by the year 2020. Now let’s just take a quick look at our Q1 results for our two business units. Starting with North American delivery on Slide 12. As a reminder, our Delivery business includes Staples Business Advantage, staples.com, staples.ca and Quill. It now generates more than 60% of our annual sales and nearly three quarters of our annual operating income. In this division, comparable sales were down less than 1% versus Q1 of last year. During the first quarter, we continued to execute our plan and I'm pleased with our progress. In Staples Business Advantage, we are investing in sales force, supply chain, lead generation and the customer experience to drive long-term growth. In Q1, comp sales were up 1% in Staples Business Advantage with growth in all of our Pro categories. Sales were up in the double-digits in break room and technology, high single-digits in facilities and low single-digit growth in furniture and promotional products. Sales in categories like ink and toner, paper and office supplies were down about 1%. At the same time, we are retooling our staples.com and quill.com businesses as we move toward a model designed for customers who value relationships and service and move away from customers who are more transaction and promotion oriented. As planned, we experienced modest sales headwinds in staples.com and quill.com as we execute our strategic pivot to improve our value proposition with business customers and strengthen our foundation for long-term growth. During Q1, North American Delivery operating income rate decreased 66 basis points to 5.2%, and operating income declined $22 million year-over-year. The decline in operating income rates reflects our growth investments in sales force, marketing and supply chain, partially offset by increased product margin rates. Turning to North American Retail on Slide 13. As you know, our top priority here is to preserve profitability, and we had an excellent first quarter. North American Retail operating income rate increased 54 basis points to 3.5%, and operating income increased $4 million versus Q1 of last year. This primarily reflects increased product margin rate as a result of the progress we have made reducing product costs, a more analytical and disciplined promotional strategy and favorable sales mix, somewhat offset by the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses. And with that, I'll turn it over to Christine to review our first quarter financial results in more detail and provide our outlook. Christine Komola Thanks, Shira. Let's start on Slide 14 with some additional color on our Q1 financial results. Total company comparable sales declined less than 3% versus Q1 of last year. This excludes headwinds of about 150 basis points from acquisitions and divestitures over the past year and 80 basis points from store closures. During Q1, gross profit decreased $34 million versus Q1 of last year, and gross profit rate increased 49 basis points year-over-year to 26%, which was in-line with our expectations. This reflects increased product margin rate and a more disciplined promotional strategy, somewhat offset by supply chain initiatives in North America Delivery and the negative impact of lower sales and fixed expenses in North America Retail. Total Company SG&A decreased $20 million year-over-year, and SG&A rate increased 61 basis points to 21.6% on a non-GAAP basis. The increased rate reflects investments to accelerate growth in North America Delivery as well as the negative impact of lower sales on fixed expenses in North America Retail. These headwinds were somewhat offset by ongoing expense management and operational efficiencies across the Company. Total Company operating income on a non-GAAP basis declined $15 million year-over-year to $171 million, and operating income rates decreased 15 basis points to 4.1%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for continuing operations came in at 32% for Q1, which was favorable to our guidance of 33.5%. The favorability was primarily driven by our geographic distribution of earnings. We expect our full-year non-GAAP effective tax rate for continuing operations to be approximately 32%. During the first quarter, we achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.17, a decline of approximately $0.02 versus Q1 of last year. Turning to cash flow on Slide 15. Q1 capital expenditures came in at $37 million, a decrease of $7 million versus the prior year. With operating cash flow of $258 million, our Q1 free cash flow was $221 million. We ended Q1 with approximately $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Turning to our outlook on Slide 16. We expect second quarter fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $0.10 to $0.13. This reflects continued progress on our cost initiatives, offset by the investments we have been making to accelerate mid-market growth and Pro Category growth with business customers of all sizes. We remain on-track to generate at least $500 million of free cash flow and to close approximately 70 stores in 2017. I'll now turn it back over to Shannon, our conference call moderator, for Q&A. Question-And-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. You may begin. Shira Goodman Good morning Greg. Gregory Melich Good morning. Had a couple of questions. One, I’ll start with the free cash flow the tightened strategy. The $500 million goal, does that include any cash costs for restructuring or closing stores or is that basically a net number? Is that number significant? Then I have a follow-up on the business. Shira Goodman I'll let Christine answer that. Christine Komola Hi Greg, that is including, which is not significant. Gregory Melich Got it. So it includes that, but it's not a significant number like it was a few years ago? Christine Komola That's correct. Gregory Melich Got it, and then secondly, just so I understand the new phase of the 2020 Shira that you outlined, what should we expect in terms of investment, whether it be in gross margin, SG&A or CapEx to get to that next level? You mentioned about - it sounded like assortment, but service - just sort of take us through the business model argument about really ramping it up with Business Advantage. Shira Goodman Right. I'm glad you asked that because it's so core to our go-forward strategy. And so what we find with our customers is they clearly want the basics, which is assortment, fair prices and reliable deliveries. And we deliver on all of those very well. But what in customers in the Pro categories want in addition to that, is the expertise we bring as well as the services. And that's really what differentiates it, it creates a much stickier relationship, more profitable relationship. In terms of the investments, I mean, we are not really disclosing the exact amounts at this time, but as we said, this is a multi-year journey, and we believe the opportunity is large, and we are going to invest behind it. Jeffrey Hall Yes, just to be clear, we don't expect though meaningful CapEx investments. The investments we see here are really as we build out our supply chain expertise and capacity as well as adding the additional experts in sales force into our sales forces to support these Pro categories. Shira Goodman So you already seen the indicators of the investments in Q1. Jeffrey Hall That's exactly right. Gregory Melich Got it, alright. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. You may begin. Brian Nagel Hi, good morning. Shira Goodman Good morning Brian. Brian Nagel So a couple of questions. First off, just on gross margin. This is now a second consecutive quarter, we saw a nice uptake. Again, just maybe quickly, I mean how the drivers and the sustainability of that line as we think over the balance of 2017 and beyond, and then I have a follow-up. Shira Goodman So I'll answer that first, and Christine might chime in as well. I'm really proud of the work that our team has done on gross margin, and I do believe it is something that is sustainable. It reflects a few things: much better product cost, because we are looking at end-to-end relationships with our vendors and much smarter promotional strategies as well as a change in mix to more of the higher-value areas such as print and marketing services. So let's look at retail for a minute, if you take technology as an example, technology was responsible for half of our comps decline in retail. That's both due to the industry as well us by pulling back from promotional technology, but having said that, we sold higher-end technology. Our team did an amazing job of attaching that with services. They leveraged their expertise to find the right technology for our customers, and as a result, gross margin dollars are up. And I think that is really indicative of our strategy. Christine Komola And what I would add Brian actually to Shira's point is that is 100% kind of our strategy across all business units, so while we don't give specific guidance on line items, as you know. We feel pretty good about the work that we are doing within gross margin and that's enabling us to help fund some of the different investments that we asked about earlier. Brian Nagel Great, very helpful, and then the second question, my follow-up, maybe I'll make it kind of two parts, but as far as the Pro Category, and clearly you had some success there. We continue to call out as a big focus for Staples. Are you selling there to the same customer or as you push these Pro categories, are using a bit of a shift in the core customer base for Staples? Shira Goodman I'm sorry, Brian. Brian Nagel No, go ahead. Go ahead. Shira Goodman It varies by customer and t varies by customers size. So the smaller the customer, the more likely it is to be a single buyer, and also it also includes furniture and facilities very often is one buyer. Tech and office products can be together. Often office products and break room can be together. When you move to larger customers, the connective tissue is often that they have sophisticated procurement departments and strategic sourcing where it comes together, and I think in all cases, what they really value is A, you are working with an established supplier and there is someone you trust and you know is reliable in terms on delivering the value proposition. And then obviously, savvy buyers know the value of vendor consolidation. Brian Nagel Got it. Okay, well thank you and I’ll turn it over to someone else. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. You may begin. Shira Goodman Good morning Kate. Kate McShane Good morning. With regard to North American Delivery, could you give more detail around the customer acquisition versus the customer attrition during the quarter? And is your guidance baking in an inflection in NAD for the remaining three quarters of the year? Shira Goodman So I will answer the first. I'm not sure I caught the second. So in terms of acquisition and retention, they are actually remarkably steady in Staples Business Advantage. And the one area that we are seeing a little bit of the weakness is core office supplies to existing customers, which I really think reflects secular trends, but our acquisition and retention is as strong as ever. And if you could repeat the second half of your question. Kate McShane Just with regards to the outlook and guidance. Are you baking in an inflection for our North American Delivery for the remaining three quarters of the year? Jeffrey Hall So just to be clear, we haven't guided for anything but the second quarter at this point, and the simple answer there is we expect the trends from Q1 to continue. We expect to continue to grow in our mid-market, in our BOSS categories and continue to see headwinds in the core office supplies and the dot-com businesses. Kate McShane Thank you. Shira Goodman Thank you Kate. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Simeon Gutman Thanks good morning. With regard to the mid-market, it's clearly helping the NAD business today. Can you lay out a timeframe when you anticipate growth in the mid-market to be able to be strong enough to flip the entire segment to positive? And can you remind us the percentage of sales from mid-market? And what the overall run rate is in terms of dollar growth? Shira Goodman So in terms of flipping it to positive sales, I mean that is clearly our aspiration, and that's within the line of sight for us. And keep in mind, it's not only mid-market growth, it's also the Pro Category growth. When we talk about mid-market, the very clean definition would be mid-market through Staples Business Advantage, which is about $1.5 billion. But keep in mind, we also have a lot of mid-market customers who shop on staples.com, Quill and stores and that's actually one of our big competitive advantages, because it highly take what we do so successfully in SBA and move it to some of these other channels where we interact with those customers. Simeon Gutman And as mid-market grows as an overall percentage, I'm assuming that's favorable for gross margin. Is that correct? And then, if you look just within the mid-market gross margin, is that moving up within itself year-over-year? Shira Goodman So I'll answer the first, and maybe Christine can answer the second. Yes, definitely favorable for both gross margin and bottom line, and that was part of the reason why we chose mid-market as really a target segment. There was a very clear customer need that we could uniquely suit, and it's a very profitable segment for us. Christine Komola I think just on the gross margin question, these customers are growing fastest in our Pro Category line of business, which has a slightly lower gross margin rate, but the dollars are what is important to us, and those are growing fast. And from a bottom line perspective, cost-to-serve, they are definitely growing nicely. Simeon Gutman Okay. I'm just going to sneak in one more. Can you talk about how PCs are performing? In the retail, we have heard there has been bit of bounce back in the category. I think units were up in North America in the first quarter. Curious what you are seeing and how you describe the tenor of the category? Shira Goodman So again, I'll give a high level, and then Christine will probably chime in. Overall, we are pleased with what our team is doing with technology sales. As I said, it's clearly driving half of the comps decline, but overall profit dollars are up, as we just sell the higher-end PCs, and our team does a great job with attaching the appropriate products and services so that our customers can go back to their offices and workplace and use them efficiently. Christine Komola And, I think just to build on that, we definitely feel much better about the computers and the Technology Services overall. So our tech services business is partnering very closely with the technology hardware and software teams and feel that we have got a much more sustainable proposition, which is narrower, a smaller base of business, but it should be less volatile over time. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Matthew Fassler Thanks a lot and good morning. There are two dynamics you to discussed related to the commercial and Delivery business. One was the impact of comparisons on the growth and talking about two year stack. And the second related to growth investments and the impact that, that had on operating margin in that business. On the first piece, because we only have, I think, the fourth quarter comp reported as a comp for the Delivery business given that the restatement and the inclusion of online in that division with Q4, I'm wondering if you could talk to us about what the trend was through last year from a comparable sales perspective in that division overall. Shira Goodman Christine. Christine Komola Yes, sure. So Matt, in general if you look at our Business Advantage, it's been pretty steady on a two year stacked basis. Last year, a year ago from now, it was higher primarily because of the business that we acquired in acquisition front that we went pretty heavy on. We continue to feel and see a steady state improvement over the long-term in our acquisition, and that's what's driving the growth there, but when erosion on the core business is kind of the offset, and it's been a pretty consistent story where we see the biggest growth to Shira's point is on the mid-market, and that's kind of taking over the lead building growth in the overall business. Shira Goodman And Matt, if I could just help you unpack that a little bit perhaps strategically. Transforming our overall Company we are transforming our Delivery business to ensure long-term profitable growth, and we are really building on our strengths, which is relationships and bringing together product, services and expertise. And as I said, that combination is differentiated. It's valued by our customers, and it's profitable, which is why I think the two key measures that we often report memberships, which is great indicator of relationships and Pro Category growth, which are the categories are really build on our expertise are both critical. To your point, it doesn't happen in a quarter. A lot of this is building on things we have done well for many years, and in other cases, we are innovating our way into new ways of doing business. Matthew Fassler And so if we think, as we work on our forecast, did the trend again because of your restatements, it's a bit hard to get other details I'm thinking about the Delivery business overall I know at SBA Plus online, did the trend improve through last year on an underlying basis or deteriorate? So if we were to keep the two year stack flat, would the absolute number decelerate or accelerate here? Jeffrey Hall Trended down a little bit over the longer term. It's been pretty flat over the last three quarters or so. The trend is down as Shira just described as we pivot this business, but we have seen it flat out there over the last couple of quarters. Matthew Fassler Thank you. And then just on the second part of my question. So last year, each quarter of the year, you achieved operating leverage in the Commercial and Delivery business on a restated basis. So the investments that you made in Q1 were a bit of a change in trend, and I think you articulated the rationale for those investments very clearly. Is this investment phase, if you will, a one quarter phase? Is this the bulk of it or does that play out to some degree over the course of the year? Shira Goodman I think it will play out over the course of the year. We expect 2017 to be an investment year for our Delivery business and primarily in mid-market and our Pro Categories. Matthew Fassler Got it. Thank you so much guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Michael Baker Hi. I guess just following up on Matt's question in investments in the first quarter. So you said continue throughout the year, but where continue at the same way and, I guess the question is at some point this year or when can we expect operating profits to be up in that delivery segment? And, I guess, related to that, can you differentiate the investments that you are making in personnel versus price or other kinds of investments? Thanks. Jeffrey Hall Yes, we expect the investment to increase a little bit form here over the course of the year. We haven't been specific about guiding into the out quarters, but obviously, you see us guiding down into Q2. So we do expect those investments to go up. The investments are really focused at this point as I said earlier on adding the expertise and the sales force into the Pro Categories and building out the supply chain really for two things. Supply chain, so that we can enhance our ability to do next-day deliver all these BOSS categories and other categories where we see significant value. And also we are bringing on some inventory that we haven't previously stocked in the past, which then also helps us improve our customer service as well as we think bring some incremental margin in the out quarters. Michael Baker Okay, thank you. Operator Next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. You may begin. Unidentified Analyst Hi, this is [indiscernible] filling in for Mike Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking our question. So your North America Retail margins expanded quite nicely this quarter. it sequentially improved over what you have seen in the prior few quarters. How long do you think you can maintain this profitability even in a scenario where you continue to see a mid-single-digit comp decline retail segment. Shira Goodman So the whole strategy for North American Retail is to preserve profitability. And we think that the strategies that we are taking there and being much more disciplined around promotions, focusing on in-store selling are the right strategies and will enable us to preserve profitability. I'm not sure I can promise that profit dollars will grow every single quarter, but our goal is to very much manage any decline. Unidentified Analyst Okay, that's pretty helpful. Thank you very much. Shira Goodman Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies. You may begin. Shira Goodman Good morning Dan. Daniel Binder Good morning, thanks. I just had a question around the large contract business and what you are seeing in the marketplace from a competitive bidding standpoint. And if you talk a little bit about that end of the business, is it being driven more by customer acquisition and what does sales look like with existing customers? Shira Goodman So as I said, in our commercial and enterprise space, it's very steady in terms of acquisition and our pipeline and retention. Obviously, our goal there is to drive Pro Category growth as well, and our team is doing a nice job of that. Customers in that area really value. They have probably been on the forefront of valuing the expertise and services that we bring to the table and the headwind in that area is a secular decline that we are managing our way through. Jeffrey Hall Yes. So we love our business here, we have nice share and very high retention of the customers that we have. Right they love the service we provide, we provide a service that's really unmatched. And we continue to be able to retain and grow that business as a result. Shira Goodman And one of the key things of that is the next-day delivery that we do. And our supply chain team has really done a great job of upping our service levels and just having a very high degree of consistency and quality, which is just critical to that relationship. Daniel Binder And what are you seeing in the marketplace as you go to bid on business? Are you running into more competitive environment than you were let's say a few quarters ago or is it about the same? And have you seen Amazon start showing up in any of these larger company bids? I know they have got [indiscernible] communities business, which is a little bit different, but just curious if you are seeing anything out of that. Jeffrey Hall Competitive environment really hasn't changed. It's always been competitive, it continues to be competitive. As I said we love our position, we love our retention rate here. So we are happy with our offering. The simple answer is we have not really seen Amazon in any meaningful way. Certainly, we keep an eye on them, we keep a look at what they are doing. We are kind of vigilant in making sure that we are not going to get surprised from the outside in, but at this point, we aren't seeing any meaningful participation. Shira Goodman And the other thing I would add is it's actually those larger customers who have a much firmer grasp on the total cost-to-serve. And therefore, while the actual prize is important and always will be important, it's the total cost-to-serve that is really important if they are going out to bid. Daniel Binder And then the last one if I could on e-commerce and specifically staples.com or quill.com, you mentioned some headwinds there. Are you finding that the transparency that we get on the web, is it more of a pricing issue that's a headwind or is it something more than that? Shira Goodman No, I think it's much more strategic that as we have looked at those businesses in light of our overall strategy, we really want to be migrating them much more to a relationship based business as well. That's why we are selling memberships both in staples.com and Quill, and we have had good uptake in both of those channels. And again, there are elements of the memberships that are price related and enable us to offer great pricing to our customers, but it's also building more of that relationship with them. Daniel Binder Okay. Thanks. Shira Goodman Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. You may begin. Shira Goodman Good morning Chris. Christopher Horvers Good morning. So you talked about the product acquisition cost improving which is pretty remarkable considering your sales are down on a comp basis in both divisions. So can you peel out that part a little bit? Are you seeing any sort of giveback as the core office supply business [KEs] (Ph) or maybe you are getting more leverage there? And is that the expansion also driven by the volume synergies that you are seeing as you expand BOSS? Shira Goodman So I'll answer, and then others might want to chime in. It really is across the board, Chris. Yes, we are seeing a lot more buying synergies in BOSS as we have gotten to be much more scale for a lot of those vendors. So you are right. There is a lot of opportunity there, and I think that's actually opportunity that we are just right now skimming the top off of. The other thing I would add is own brand plays a really important role here. So part of our strategy is both to drive own brand penetration but also our increased sophistication with own brand and product cost really enables us to be a very savvy partner and negotiator with our suppliers. Jeffrey Hall If I could just summarize what Shira said, we have a great merchandising team, and they are executing well. Christopher Horvers So the own brand, is that expansion of own brand? Or is that just how your sourcing the own brand? Shira Goodman Yes, and yes. So we clearly are looking to expand own brand. Our penetration for own brand in our legacy categories is quite high and about much lower in our Pro Categories. So we have a large initiative with our own brand team driving some of penetration in our Pro Categories, especially as we gain scale there. And then the other thing is just better sourcing of it. And then the third piece that the team has really worked on is lead time. That's a key component of own brand. And the more we can bring down our lead time, that obviously helps with working capital as well as service levels. Christopher Horvers Got it. And then on the NAD comp side, you mentioned the two year stack. You also mentioned seeing line of sight to grow. So is that how the compares play out for the rest of the year essentially if I held two year stacks, do we turn positive following up that prior question? Or is it something that you are seeing in terms of the momentum in the mid-market in the expanded categories? Jeffrey Hall Yes. I think we are pretty clear we see 2017 as really as an investment year as we start to grow these things out and continue to execute our strategy. So while we certainly see that we are starting to gain traction, and we are excited about the opportunity, we think it is quarters out into the future. Christopher Horvers Understood, and then just one quick last one. So you do a great job managing NAR profitability. How are incentivizing people in that division? Is it based on sales? Is it based on sort of cash flow decay rate? And any specificity around sort of what the bar is around cash flows and compensation would really be really helpful. Thank you. Shira Goodman Yes. So our bonus plan this year is very clear and very synced up with our strategy. In North American Retail, it's operating income. In North American Delivery, its sales and operating income and obviously, it's linked to EPS because we need to be able to fund our bonus, but I think everyone across the company really understands the role they play. It is this is a team support here, and I couldn't be more proud of the different groups within Staples for embracing their roles and executing to that. Christopher Horvers Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital. You may begin. Anthony Chukumba Just turning back to North American Retail, I mean, as you said, I mean, you did a really nice job of increasing operating margin, but, I guess, I was just looking for a little color on comp store sales. Conversion, as you said, improved. So it sounds like travel must have really kind of fallen pretty significantly. I was just wondering if you could just give a little color as to why traffic was down so much. Thank you. Shira Goodman Well, I think traffic is down in retail. I think the second piece of it is we are driving less of the promotions that might drive traffic but don't drive profit. But having said that, I think we have also looked at our marketing very scientifically, and we do believe that there is some opportunities to drive further traffic as we have done that. Anthony Chukumba That's helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Your may begin. Shira Goodman Good morning Joe. Joseph Feldman Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask can, you share with us the latest on what happens when you close a store, meaning like what does go on in the market, especially with the new focus on the Pro? Do you see any issues related to that customer in terms of spending one way or the other, and how it might impact you overall? Jeffrey Hall It's hard to be generic on that. I would say that, for the most part, when we close a store, first of all, when we close a store, there is very little costs for us, but we think about the customers, we certainly make an effort to then get those customers into our dot-come or into other stores. At this point, the stores we are closing aren't that geographically close to the other stores. So there's not a large pickup in our other stores, and we have seen some small pickup in the dot-com but really not meaningful, not as much as we would like to see. Joseph Feldman That’s helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Shira Goodman for closing remarks. Shira Goodman Thank you very much again for joining us today and I would like to thank the entire Staples team for all of their hard work in Q1. Staples 2020 is a multi-year journey, and I'm confident that we have the right plan and the right team in place to get back to sustainable sales and earnings growth while achieving our long-term goals. Thanks for joining us, and have a great day. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

Our first question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. You may begin. Shira Goodman Good morning Greg. Gregory Melich Good morning. Had a couple of questions. One, I’ll start with the free cash flow the tightened strategy. The $500 million goal, does that include any cash costs for restructuring or closing stores or is that basically a net number? Is that number significant? Then I have a follow-up on the business. Shira Goodman I'll let Christine answer that. Christine Komola Hi Greg, that is including, which is not significant. Gregory Melich Got it. So it includes that, but it's not a significant number like it was a few years ago? Christine Komola That's correct. Gregory Melich Got it, and then secondly, just so I understand the new phase of the 2020 Shira that you outlined, what should we expect in terms of investment, whether it be in gross margin, SG&A or CapEx to get to that next level? You mentioned about - it sounded like assortment, but service - just sort of take us through the business model argument about really ramping it up with Business Advantage. Shira Goodman Right. I'm glad you asked that because it's so core to our go-forward strategy. And so what we find with our customers is they clearly want the basics, which is assortment, fair prices and reliable deliveries. And we deliver on all of those very well. But what in customers in the Pro categories want in addition to that, is the expertise we bring as well as the services. And that's really what differentiates it, it creates a much stickier relationship, more profitable relationship. In terms of the investments, I mean, we are not really disclosing the exact amounts at this time, but as we said, this is a multi-year journey, and we believe the opportunity is large, and we are going to invest behind it. Jeffrey Hall Yes, just to be clear, we don't expect though meaningful CapEx investments.

Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. You may begin. Brian Nagel Hi, good morning. Shira Goodman Good morning Brian. Brian Nagel So a couple of questions. First off, just on gross margin. This is now a second consecutive quarter, we saw a nice uptake. Again, just maybe quickly, I mean how the drivers and the sustainability of that line as we think over the balance of 2017 and beyond, and then I have a follow-up.

And the second related to growth investments and the impact that, that had on operating margin in that business. On the first piece, because we only have, I think, the fourth quarter comp reported as a comp for the Delivery business given that the restatement and the inclusion of online in that division with Q4, I'm wondering if you could talk to us about what the trend was through last year from a comparable sales perspective in that division overall. Shira Goodman Christine. Christine Komola Yes, sure. So Matt, in general if you look at our Business Advantage, it's been pretty steady on a two year stacked basis. Last year, a year ago from now, it was higher primarily because of the business that we acquired in acquisition front that we went pretty heavy on. We continue to feel and see a steady state improvement over the long-term in our acquisition, and that's what's driving the growth there, but when erosion on the core business is kind of the offset, and it's been a pretty consistent story where we see the biggest growth to Shira's point is on the mid-market, and that's kind of taking over the lead building growth in the overall business. Shira Goodman And Matt, if I could just help you unpack that a little bit perhaps strategically. Transforming our overall Company we are transforming our Delivery business to ensure long-term profitable growth, and we are really building on our strengths, which is relationships and bringing together product, services and expertise. And as I said, that combination is differentiated. It's valued by our customers, and it's profitable, which is why I think the two key measures that we often report memberships, which is great indicator of relationships and Pro Category growth, which are the categories are really build on our expertise are both critical. To your point, it doesn't happen in a quarter. A lot of this is building on things we have done well for many years, and in other cases, we are innovating our way into new ways of doing business. Matthew Fassler And so if we think, as we work on our forecast, did the trend again because of your restatements, it's a bit hard to get other details I'm thinking about the Delivery business overall I know at SBA Plus online, did the trend improve through last year on an underlying basis or deteriorate? So if we were to keep the two year stack flat, would the absolute number decelerate or accelerate here? Jeffrey Hall Trended down a little bit over the longer term. It's been pretty flat over the last three quarters or so. The trend is down as Shira just described as we pivot this business, but we have seen it flat out there over the last couple of quarters. Matthew Fassler Thank you. And then just on the second part of my question. So last year, each quarter of the year, you achieved operating leverage in the Commercial and Delivery business on a restated basis. So the investments that you made in Q1 were a bit of a change in trend, and I think you articulated the rationale for those investments very clearly. Is this investment phase, if you will, a one quarter phase? Is this the bulk of it or does that play out to some degree over the course of the year? Shira Goodman I think it will play out over the course of the year. We expect 2017 to be an investment year for our Delivery business and primarily in mid-market and our Pro Categories. Matthew Fassler Got it. Thank you so much guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Michael Baker Hi. I guess just following up on Matt's question in investments in the first quarter. So you said continue throughout the year, but where continue at the same way and, I guess the question is at some point this year or when can we expect operating profits to be up in that delivery segment? And, I guess, related to that, can you differentiate the investments that you are making in personnel versus price or other kinds of investments? Thanks. Jeffrey Hall Yes, we expect the investment to increase a little bit form here over the course of the year. We haven't been specific about guiding into the out quarters, but obviously, you see us guiding down into Q2. So we do expect those investments to go up. The investments are really focused at this point as I said earlier on adding the expertise and the sales force into the Pro Categories and building out the supply chain really for two things. Supply chain, so that we can enhance our ability to do next-day deliver all these BOSS categories and other categories where we see significant value. And also we are bringing on some inventory that we haven't previously stocked in the past, which then also helps us improve our customer service as well as we think bring some incremental margin in the out quarters. Michael Baker Okay, thank you. Operator Next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. You may begin. Unidentified Analyst Hi, this is [indiscernible] filling in for Mike Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking our question. So your North America Retail margins expanded quite nicely this quarter. it sequentially improved over what you have seen in the prior few quarters. How long do you think you can maintain this profitability even in a scenario where you continue to see a mid-single-digit comp decline retail segment. Shira Goodman So the whole strategy for North American Retail is to preserve profitability. And we think that the strategies that we are taking there and being much more disciplined around promotions, focusing on in-store selling are the right strategies and will enable us to preserve profitability. I'm not sure I can promise that profit dollars will grow every single quarter, but our goal is to very much manage any decline. Unidentified Analyst Okay, that's pretty helpful. Thank you very much. Shira Goodman Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies. You may begin. Shira Goodman Good morning Dan. Daniel Binder Good morning, thanks. I just had a question around the large contract business and what you are seeing in the marketplace from a competitive bidding standpoint. And if you talk a little bit about that end of the business, is it being driven more by customer acquisition and what does sales look like with existing customers? Shira Goodman So as I said, in our commercial and enterprise space, it's very steady in terms of acquisition and our pipeline and retention. Obviously, our goal there is to drive Pro Category growth as well, and our team is doing a nice job of that. Customers in that area really value. They have probably been on the forefront of valuing the expertise and services that we bring to the table and the headwind in that area is a secular decline that we are managing our way through. Jeffrey Hall Yes. So we love our business here, we have nice share and very high retention of the customers that we have. Right they love the service we provide, we provide a service that's really unmatched. And we continue to be able to retain and grow that business as a result. Shira Goodman And one of the key things of that is the next-day delivery that we do. And our supply chain team has really done a great job of upping our service levels and just having a very high degree of consistency and quality, which is just critical to that relationship. Daniel Binder And what are you seeing in the marketplace as you go to bid on business? Are you running into more competitive environment than you were let's say a few quarters ago or is it about the same? And have you seen Amazon start showing up in any of these larger company bids? I know they have got [indiscernible] communities business, which is a little bit different, but just curious if you are seeing anything out of that. Jeffrey Hall Competitive environment really hasn't changed. It's always been competitive, it continues to be competitive. As I said we love our position, we love our retention rate here. So we are happy with our offering. The simple answer is we have not really seen Amazon in any meaningful way. Certainly, we keep an eye on them, we keep a look at what they are doing. We are kind of vigilant in making sure that we are not going to get surprised from the outside in, but at this point, we aren't seeing any meaningful participation. Shira Goodman And the other thing I would add is it's actually those larger customers who have a much firmer grasp on the total cost-to-serve. And therefore, while the actual prize is important and always will be important, it's the total cost-to-serve that is really important if they are going out to bid. Daniel Binder And then the last one if I could on e-commerce and specifically staples.com or quill.com, you mentioned some headwinds there. Are you finding that the transparency that we get on the web, is it more of a pricing issue that's a headwind or is it something more than that? Shira Goodman No, I think it's much more strategic that as we have looked at those businesses in light of our overall strategy, we really want to be migrating them much more to a relationship based business as well. That's why we are selling memberships both in staples.com and Quill, and we have had good uptake in both of those channels. And again, there are elements of the memberships that are price related and enable us to offer great pricing to our customers, but it's also building more of that relationship with them. Daniel Binder Okay. Thanks. Shira Goodman Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. You may begin. Shira Goodman Good morning Chris. Christopher Horvers Good morning. So you talked about the product acquisition cost improving which is pretty remarkable considering your sales are down on a comp basis in both divisions. So can you peel out that part a little bit? Are you seeing any sort of giveback as the core office supply business [KEs] (Ph) or maybe you are getting more leverage there? And is that the expansion also driven by the volume synergies that you are seeing as you expand BOSS? Shira Goodman So I'll answer, and then others might want to chime in. It really is across the board, Chris. Yes, we are seeing a lot more buying synergies in BOSS as we have gotten to be much more scale for a lot of those vendors. So you are right. There is a lot of opportunity there, and I think that's actually opportunity that we are just right now skimming the top off of. The other thing I would add is own brand plays a really important role here. So part of our strategy is both to drive own brand penetration but also our increased sophistication with own brand and product cost really enables us to be a very savvy partner and negotiator with our suppliers. Jeffrey Hall If I could just summarize what Shira said, we have a great merchandising team, and they are executing well. Christopher Horvers So the own brand, is that expansion of own brand? Or is that just how your sourcing the own brand? Shira Goodman Yes, and yes. So we clearly are looking to expand own brand. Our penetration for own brand in our legacy categories is quite high and about much lower in our Pro Categories. So we have a large initiative with our own brand team driving some of penetration in our Pro Categories, especially as we gain scale there. And then the other thing is just better sourcing of it. And then the third piece that the team has really worked on is lead time. That's a key component of own brand. And the more we can bring down our lead time, that obviously helps with working capital as well as service levels. Christopher Horvers Got it. And then on the NAD comp side, you mentioned the two year stack. You also mentioned seeing line of sight to grow. So is that how the compares play out for the rest of the year essentially if I held two year stacks, do we turn positive following up that prior question? Or is it something that you are seeing in terms of the momentum in the mid-market in the expanded categories? Jeffrey Hall Yes. I think we are pretty clear we see 2017 as really as an investment year as we start to grow these things out and continue to execute our strategy. So while we certainly see that we are starting to gain traction, and we are excited about the opportunity, we think it is quarters out into the future. Christopher Horvers Understood, and then just one quick last one. So you do a great job managing NAR profitability. How are incentivizing people in that division? Is it based on sales? Is it based on sort of cash flow decay rate? And any specificity around sort of what the bar is around cash flows and compensation would really be really helpful. Thank you. Shira Goodman Yes. So our bonus plan this year is very clear and very synced up with our strategy. In North American Retail, it's operating income. In North American Delivery, its sales and operating income and obviously, it's linked to EPS because we need to be able to fund our bonus, but I think everyone across the company really understands the role they play. It is this is a team support here, and I couldn't be more proud of the different groups within Staples for embracing their roles and executing to that. Christopher Horvers Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital. You may begin. Anthony Chukumba Just turning back to North American Retail, I mean, as you said, I mean, you did a really nice job of increasing operating margin, but, I guess, I was just looking for a little color on comp store sales. Conversion, as you said, improved. So it sounds like travel must have really kind of fallen pretty significantly. I was just wondering if you could just give a little color as to why traffic was down so much. Thank you. Shira Goodman Well, I think traffic is down in retail. I think the second piece of it is we are driving less of the promotions that might drive traffic but don't drive profit. But having said that, I think we have also looked at our marketing very scientifically, and we do believe that there is some opportunities to drive further traffic as we have done that. Anthony Chukumba That's helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Your may begin. Shira Goodman Good morning Joe. Joseph Feldman Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask can, you share with us the latest on what happens when you close a store, meaning like what does go on in the market, especially with the new focus on the Pro? Do you see any issues related to that customer in terms of spending one way or the other, and how it might impact you overall? Jeffrey Hall It's hard to be generic on that. I would say that, for the most part, when we close a store, first of all, when we close a store, there is very little costs for us, but we think about the customers, we certainly make an effort to then get those customers into our dot-come or into other stores. At this point, the stores we are closing aren't that geographically close to the other stores. So there's not a large pickup in our other stores, and we have seen some small pickup in the dot-com but really not meaningful, not as much as we would like to see. Joseph Feldman That’s helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Shira Goodman for closing remarks. Shira Goodman Thank you very much again for joining us today and I would like to thank the entire Staples team for all of their hard work in Q1. Staples 2020 is a multi-year journey, and I'm confident that we have the right plan and the right team in place to get back to sustainable sales and earnings growth while achieving our long-term goals. Thanks for joining us, and have a great day. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

Operator Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now we'll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin. Robert Blair - Western Digital Corp. Good afternoon, everyone. This call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws, including statements concerning our expected future financial performance and our market positioning, expectations regarding growth opportunities, our financial and business strategies and execution, integration activities and achievement of synergy goals, demand in market trends, our product portfolio, product features, development efforts and expansion into new data storage markets, and our joint venture partnership and business ventures with Toshiba. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC on February 7, 2017. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. Further, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures will be posted in the investor relations section of our website. We have not fully reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort. In the question-and-answer part of today's call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question to allow as many callers as possible to ask their question. Thank you in advance for that, and I now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer Steve Milligan. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal third quarter financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We reported strong financial performance in the March quarter, enabled by excellent operational execution by our team and favorable trends across all of our end markets. We reported revenue of $4.6 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 39% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.39. With three consecutive quarters of strong financial results following the completion of the SanDisk acquisition, we are seeing continued validation of our growth strategy and our ongoing transformation into a comprehensive provider of diversified storage products and technologies. We have constructed a powerful platform with the broadest set of products, enabling us to be a leader in the storage industry. Our transformation over the last several years provides us with the opportunity to not only compete in today's marketplace, but to be strongly positioned to grow and thrive into the future. And I would remind you that the results we are achieving today do not yet reflect the full impact of our targeted synergies from our HGST and SanDisk integrations. The healthy current demand environment underscores the unabated growth in data and its increasing value in our professional and personal lives. As the new Western Digital, we are enjoying increasingly strategic relationships with our customers as they contemplate pivotal technology and architectural transitions. Strengthening our ability to play a leading role in the storage industry, our team continues to execute very well on two key strategic priorities. The integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD, and the ramp of our 3D NAND technology, each of which Mark and Mike will elaborate on. I want to share some thoughts on Toshiba's efforts to divest their memory business. Since 2000, Western Digital has been a partner with Toshiba, driving flash memory innovation and contributing significant value to our respective stakeholders through our joint venture in Japan. Our goals throughout this, the current process, have remained consistent and resolute. First, to protect and preserve the health of the JV, which we believe is one of the most successful in the technology industry, and in which we have invested more than $13 billion over its 17-year duration. Second, to protect our interest with respect to any transaction involving the JV interest or assets, none of which could be completed without our consent. And finally, to explore potential long-term value creation opportunities for both Western Digital's and Toshiba's stakeholders. We are committed to continuing this storied partnership in Japan. As we have communicated directly to Toshiba, we believe Western Digital is best positioned to lead and implement a transaction that will achieve the goals of all of Toshiba's stakeholders. And we are working with them to develop a win-win solution. We have been communicating with key stakeholders and partners to evaluate a full range of potential alternatives to this challenging situation. I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the March quarter. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter results reflect continued strong demand for our products and focused operational execution. Industry-wide demand for NAND flash remained very strong. And the industry-wide hard drive demand was stable, together contributing to the favorable environment for our overall business. Demand was healthy across all of our end markets and this helped mitigate typical seasonality. We made further progress in our ongoing conversion to the 3D NAND technology, and our helium hard drives achieved new milestones as well. In client devices, we saw strength for embedded products and for hard drives and surveillance applications, while traditional commute demand was softer as expected. Demand for our solid-state drives for client applications increased sequentially, reflecting expansion of attach rates of SSDs to PCs and the ongoing adoption of our client SSDs, enabling us to expand our market presence. We commenced shipments of our 64-layer, 3D NAND in client SSD form factor, and we expect to further expand the usage of this industry-leading technology across our product portfolio during the remainder of calendar 2017. In the mobile embedded category, we further deepened our OEM customer engagement through increased acceptance of our eMMC solutions, including our three-bit per-cell x3 offerings. Our design win pipeline expanded within the traditional mobile categories as well as in emerging growth areas such as auto, connected home and the Internet of Things. Turning to client solutions, our comprehensive portfolio of flash and HDD products performed strongly and it significantly mitigated typical seasonal revenue decline. The strong appeal of our WD, SanDisk and G-Technology brand continues, demonstrated by ongoing consumer preference for our products on a global basis. In data center devices and solutions, we saw sustained strength for enterprise class SSDs and a growing requirement from hyperscale customers for our 10-terabyte helium capacity hard drive. We completed several additional key qualifications for the 10-terabyte drive with these customers during the March quarter. Yesterday, we announced that we have begun customer shipments of our 12-terabyte drive, our fourth-generation helium product, underscoring our generational lead in this category. I'm pleased to note that we have now shipped approximately 15 million helium hard drives cumulatively since the platform's launch four years ago. From a memory, technology and operations perspective, we are ahead of our previously communicated expectations. First, we have already achieved cost crossover for our 64-layer 3D NAND versus our 15-nanometer X3 node. Second, we now plan to produce more than 75% of our total 3D NAND bit output based on the 64-layer architecture in calendar 2017. These achievements are particularly noteworthy, indicating that our joint venture remains focused on executing our technology, manufacturing and operational strategies. Looking forward, our estimates for NAND industry bit growth rates for calendar 2017 are at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%, and for calendar 2018 somewhat higher than in 2017. When combined with the secular growth drivers for NAND flash, we believe that the NAND industry's supply-demand environment will likely remain favorable through at least the first half of calendar 2018. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial overview. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Thank you, Mike. I'm pleased with our financial performance in the March quarter. Our team executed well in a healthy market environment as we capitalized on our diversified product offerings, achieved cost targets and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow generation. Our revenue for the March quarter was $4.6 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.3 billion, client devices was $2.3 billion, and client solutions was $1 billion. Our revenue was only down 5% from our December quarter versus the typical decline of approximately 15% on a pro forma basis, which underscores our strong performance. Our data center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our March quarter revenue for data center devices and solutions declined 2% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. We saw sustained strength in capacity enterprise hard drives and sequential growth for our enterprise SSDs, offset by a decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client devices revenue for the March quarter increased 23% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, primarily driven by significant strength in embedded flash, surveillance HDD and client SSD. Client solutions revenue for the March quarter increased 6% year-over-year on a pro forma basis due to strong demand for removable and other flash-based products. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 39.3%, up 260 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 650 basis points year-over-year on a pro forma basis. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment, product cost improvements and a higher mix of flash-based revenue. Turning to operating expenses, our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $811 million. We were slightly above guidance due to higher performance-based compensation, driven by our better-than-expected financial results. We continue to make progress toward our integration synergy targets, while also making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth. Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the March quarter was $206 million, inclusive of $205 million of interest expense. In our March quarter, we successfully repriced both our euro-denominated term loan B and our U.S.-dollar term loan B. The aggregate annual savings from these two repricings will result in approximately $42 million of annual interest savings starting in our June quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the March quarter was approximately 11%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the March quarter was $716 million or $2.39 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $248 million or $0.83 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges associated with our acquisitions and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges. In the March quarter, we generated $1 billion in operating cash flow with $257 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $741 million. We also had strong working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $144 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $5.8 billion, resulting in approximately $6.8 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion undrawn revolver capacity. Our net debt outstanding has decreased approximately $1.5 billion since the beginning of the fiscal year, mostly driven by strong cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans, while also assessing value-creating strategic investment opportunities as they arise. As Steve indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration activities. We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal third quarter this year, we achieved approximately $300 million of cost-of-revenue synergies and approximately $325 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run-rate basis. With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal third quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $150 million on an annual run-rate basis toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis. I will now provide our guidance for the June quarter on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue for our June quarter to be approximately $4.8 billion, which would represent double-digit year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. As a result, for fiscal 2017 we expect to generate pro forma revenue growth that will be in line with our long-term financial model of 4% to 8%. We expect gross margin to be approximately 40%. Turning to operating expenses, we expect those to be similar to our March quarter results. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $200 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 10% to 13% range. As a result, we expect earnings per share between $2.55 and $2.65 with an estimated share count of 302 million diluted shares. As we described in detail during our last investor day, we believe our integrated product and technology platform will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we see an opportunity to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $12.00 for the full calendar year 2017. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the Q&A portion of today's call. Our first question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to focus in on the NAND business a little bit and just see if you could talk to us about the ASP trajectory in the quarter, and how we should be thinking about ASPs as we look forward and we compare back to the spot market, relative to what you guys are recognizing. Any comment on your thoughts on bit growth would also be interesting, given Samsung continues to save 30% so you guys are a little higher than them. Thanks. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. This is Mike. Let me give you comments on both. First on ASP, as you know, most of our bits are sold in products, not in the open market or at the component level, so we have realized pricing gains but – and we expect that favorable trend to continue through the back half of the year. But I would not peg us directly to the spot market price because of the way we go to market. Secondly, I think I noted the low end of the range, obviously the low end of the range being around 35%. I think we're – we remain comfortable that the industry will be in that neighborhood. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Thank you. We learned this today that former CEO of SanDisk and Chairman, just joined Micron. And, Mike, I want to better understand whether the things that you have put in place to safeguard from any potential recruiting of key assets, especially on the SanDisk side. And I have a follow-up. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Yes, well, part of – this is Steve, Mehdi. Part of our job is, no matter who shows up at what places, that our most important asset is our people. And part of the things that we try to do on a routine basis, is make sure that not only do they remain with our company, but that they're motivated and giving 110%, if you want to call it that, to the performance of the company, and we're going to continue to do that going forward, frankly, no matter who shows up at which one of the companies that may have an interest in recruiting our people. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Great. And then as follow up, going back to your helium-based product, how should we think about the mix between 10- and 12-terabyte, and do you have any assessment of your market share as helium-based products are further penetrating the install base? Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Yes, let me comment. I think as the year progresses, we would see the increasing deployment as a percentage of the total of 10-terabyte, which we feel very comfortable with our current product capability as well as our design win outlook across the major consumers of that product. Later in the year we may see some 12-terabyte begin to happen at greater scale, so that transition has begun. We also see ourselves in a good position from a exabyte share perspective, and we would think those trends will continue in a positive manner throughout the year. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess, first off, just on the 40% gross margin guide that you guys have for June quarter, could you just talk about what's driving the upside versus your longer-term model? And is it reasonable to think that both the NAND and HDD segments at this point are probably tracking well ahead of your long-term targets for each of those segments? Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Well, I think right now we're seeing a combination of stable HDD market and a strong flash market, so it's that combination that's resulting in the 40% gross margin. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. And strong execution, both from just an operational perspective and from a cost perspective, which obviously that part of it is something that we'll be doing in effect independent of the demand or pricing environment. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Exactly. And I do think on a go-forward basis over the long-term, we do have more opportunities to enhance the efficiency of our cost structure, both through our transformation that is ongoing as we said and through the deployment of our new technology as they ramp. So I think we feel very good about the gross margin performance and the long term, as we said, earnings power of this platform. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Got it. And if I could just follow-up, Steve, you talked about working with Toshiba to come up with a win-win solution with what's going on. Does that suggest that you're actually having more exclusive discussions with them at this point? And what do you think the time line to get a resolution on this process is from your perspective? Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Well, the reality is we talk to Toshiba all the time. They're our partner, and so we have ongoing engagements with them or discussions with them at various different levels. The question with regards to timing, that I can't speculate on, and so I'm going to have to punt on the answer to speculating on that question. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Fair enough. Thanks a lot, and congrats on the great execution, guys. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Thank you for taking the questions, and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to talk a little bit about the operating expense line. Mark, I think a quarter or two ago you had talked about getting to a normalized operating expense level in the $770 million range for this March quarter. I know that you're guiding flat in the current quarter, but I'm curious of how you would currently characterize your normalized operating expense level as we start to look into the realization of the full synergies. And I have a real quick follow-up as well. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Sure. I think the most important thing to keep in mind from an OpEx standpoint is we have these two factors. One is we have the higher incentive base comp that flows through when we significantly exceed our expectations. So that's one part of it, but the second, and the more important part, is we are making ongoing investments that will enable future growth, as we see the opportunity to accelerate a number of our R&D projects. So we're doing that. As I also said, we're making continued investments in other areas of IT systems to make sure that we have the right platform for this sustainable growth. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. And then as a quick follow up, I'm curious. Based on maybe my math, it looks like you saw a healthy maybe uptick in the average capacity per hard disk drive, and I'm wondering if you could talk about what you've seen there? And how we should think about that trajectory going forward? Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Well, I think two dimensions. One is there's the normal seasonality, some of the lower capacity segments in the market were running at a lower rate in the period just closed. So you get the mix up effect that happens there. But the other one that's maybe more important and secular is, as we transition to 10 terabyte and 12 terabyte in capacity enterprise and as that segment takes on a disproportionately important role for us, that will continue to drive capacity per unit up. And as I commented earlier, we expect that to continue through the balance of this year and beyond. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham and Co. Your line is now open. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions. First Mark, on the inventory side, days inventory increased or – is that just linearity in the quarter? Were you careful with shipping towards the end on any pricing issues? And then I have a follow up. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Sure. Rich, it was actually simpler than that. We had inventory build that was a function of a buffer for our ongoing transformation. And then we did have some inventory builds based on anticipated demand. So it was... Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Primarily long lead time kind of stuff, right? Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Yes. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. With the fairly strong demand we're seeing in capacity enterprise. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. That's right. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC Okay. And then – thank you. And then secondly, when it comes to the industry, the NAND side, returning to a more normal environment, I mean, how should we think about that, Mike? Is that something that's going to happen all at once? Or you think it will be a gradual thing in 2018? Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Sort of hard to be specific. I think what we – sort of the new news from us on this call that we've been talking about through the end of the calendar year, now our visibility would tell us, we think it's going to remain in a constrained environment sort of through the first half of 2018. How that evolves ultimately, hard to tell, Rich. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC Okay. Well, thank you very much and the $12 number, thanks for providing that. That's very helpful and impressive. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yes. Thank you. Steve, you said regarding Toshiba that WD should lead and help implement this transaction that would be good for all stakeholders. I was wondering what sort of ownership changes are you philosophically opposed to and why? Maybe without going into specifics of companies, but what sort of things are concerning to you regarding some of the options that were out there? Was it IP risk? Was it operational risk? What sort of things, if you could handicap that? And I have a follow-up. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Yes, I'm not going to get into the details of that on this call. One, a lot of this has been speculation in the press in terms of other bidders. And so I'd rather not get into the details of, one, our view on the situation, nor speculate on what's happening with some of these other supposed bidders. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Thanks. As my follow-up, sounds like your view on the tightness of the NAND environment, I think you guys just commented that's pushed out to first half of 2018. If you were to say, is this more a function of higher demand from newer applications or lower yields in NAND, causing supply shortages? How would you probably rank order those? Thanks. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Yes, I think – and this is Steve. I think it's a little bit of, kind of all of the above, so to speak. But one of the things that we need to understand is that this conversion – and it is a conversion as opposed to new capacity. This conversion to 3D NAND is difficult. It's difficult for all of us. We believe that we're executing in a very solid and sound fashion and demonstrated by the fact that we now achieve cost crossover with our 1Z platform. But this is tough stuff, and so it maybe is taking a little bit longer from a conversion standpoint and from a yield perspective than what people estimated. And so therefore, the bit growth rate is a little bit lower than all of us expected, and demand continues to be strong, driving a tight environment. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yes. Thanks, Steve. Congrats on the great execution. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen and Co. Your line is now open. Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC You're clearly operating toward the high end of your long-term gross margin model that you just laid out four months ago with what looks like legacy SanDisk operating with a five handle in front of it. NAND ASPs are clearly helping you and you're still in process of your 64-layer ramp, but I was hoping you could touch on the opportunities to further expand your margins within the hard drive business and specifically enterprise, as your overall margins were a record this quarter despite what looks like softer enterprise units this quarter. And I have a follow-up, please. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Yes, I think there's two areas, and then Mark will have some details. So one is, is we continue to progress forward into the 10- and 12-terabyte in capacity enterprise. That's obviously helpful to our hard drive margins. The other thing is, which was also referenced, we are not through the transformation and restructuring and integration, which will help us optimize our cost basis. So both of those things are ongoing and continue through this year and into next year. Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC Got it. And just... Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Yes. Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC Sorry. Go ahead. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Oh, no. I was just going to say a key part of the model is that given the diversified product portfolio, we have a number of operating levers that we can use to manage and optimize good environments and manage volatility in more challenging environments. So we feel very good about how that platform is evolving. Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. And just for my follow-up, you have begun to make meaningful progress on integrating Hitachi. But relative to your SanDisk integration efforts, there's still a lot of runway left and I was hoping you could just indicate where you are in the process of qualifying legacy SanDisk NAND into your own enterprise SSD business. Thank you. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Yes. So, I think, as we've discussed before, we are actually qualifying our own NAND into products as they are developing and they enter the market. We remain quite happy with our relationship with Intel, and if you think about it that way, it's actually incremental bits that we are providing to the market, so it's a net accretive or positive thing. So at this point, we are going to continue on through a generation or two, more products with our relationship with Intel, and we'll really up our participation of our own NAND in the enterprise through development and launch of new products within our portfolio. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. And that vertical integration that you're talking about really is – was not contemplated in that initial $500 million of total synergies for the 18-month window. The lion's share of that will be reflected in the 2020 target of $1.1 billion of synergies. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Next question. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Benchmark Co. Your line is now open. Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC There has been a leadership in the helium drives you've exercised for four years. Seagate has, I think, led in the shingled media area, but both firms are making progress in the areas that they were not originally leading in. I'm just wondering, do you see both firms coming to parity in each of those areas next year in terms of introduction of products and the quality of their products in shingled and in helium-filled drives? Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. I'm not going to speculate on that, Mark. I mean, we don't know where Seagate is and what progress they're making. I can tell you that our focus is on executing on our plans. And so in that regard, we will not be striving for parity. Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC What about the shingled media drives? Any estimates on what percentage of drives will be shingled media or are you going to just... Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. We haven't really provided that information. I mean, shingle's been a little bit more limited in terms of the applications because of some of the performance implications of that and that sort of thing. But we feel comfortable with where we're at in terms of SMR transition and the applicability and the drives that we're providing to our customers. Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC Congratulations and keep up the impressive results. Thank you. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Thank you, Mark. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your line is now open. Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Yes. Hi. I had a question. So, just looking at the Toshiba side, obviously, you guys are having a lot of negotiations there. Is there – do you guys have a right of first refusal? I know you have concentrates, but is there a right of first refusal and is there a time line to that process? Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. We have consent provisions, is what we have regarding any transferred assets and JV provisions, as I've mentioned earlier. Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Got it. But is there a time line to that process at all or...? Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Well, similarly, the answer to the question, I'm not going to speculate on time lines. Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Got it. And the second question is that – on the NAND side, as you look at the 14 and 64 ramp, what's the mix in the back half and what's the – how do the gross margins look? Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Well, we talked about our mix in the back half. It would be 75% of our 3D-bit output will be 64 layer exiting the calendar year. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. And that's for the – no, that's for the full calendar year, which means that by the time you get to the back half, the lion's share of our output in terms of 3-D is going to be 64 layer. Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Got it. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. We're already transitioning out of 48 into 64. 48 layer was more of a learning platform for us, if you want to call it that, as opposed to something that we intended to extensively productize and ship. It was really for our learnings. Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Got it. Great. Thanks a lot. Good quarter, guys. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Thank you so much. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. So I want to thank everybody for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you going forward. Have a great rest of the afternoon.

So both of those things are ongoing and continue through this year and into next year. Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC Got it. And just... Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Yes. Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC Sorry. Go ahead. Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp. Oh, no. I was just going to say a key part of the model is that given the diversified product portfolio, we have a number of operating levers that we can use to manage and optimize good environments and manage volatility in more challenging environments. So we feel very good about how that platform is evolving. Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. And just for my follow-up, you have begun to make meaningful progress on integrating Hitachi. But relative to your SanDisk integration efforts, there's still a lot of runway left and I was hoping you could just indicate where you are in the process of qualifying legacy SanDisk NAND into your own enterprise SSD business. Thank you. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Yes. So, I think, as we've discussed before, we are actually qualifying our own NAND into products as they are developing and they enter the market. We remain quite happy with our relationship with Intel, and if you think about it that way, it's actually incremental bits that we are providing to the market, so it's a net accretive or positive thing. So at this point, we are going to continue on through a generation or two, more products with our relationship with Intel, and we'll really up our participation of our own NAND in the enterprise through development and launch of new products within our portfolio. Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. And that vertical integration that you're talking about really is – was not contemplated in that initial $500 million of total synergies for the 18-month window. The lion's share of that will be reflected in the 2020 target of $1.1 billion of synergies. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Next question. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Benchmark Co. Your line is now open. Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC There has been a leadership in the helium drives you've exercised for four years. Seagate has, I think, led in the shingled media area, but both firms are making progress in the areas that they were not originally leading in. I'm just wondering, do you see both firms coming to parity in each of those areas next year in terms of introduction of products and the quality of their products in shingled and in helium-filled drives? Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. I'm not going to speculate on that, Mark. I mean, we don't know where Seagate is and what progress they're making. I can tell you that our focus is on executing on our plans. And so in that regard, we will not be striving for parity. Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC What about the shingled media drives? Any estimates on what percentage of drives will be shingled media or are you going to just... Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. We haven't really provided that information. I mean, shingle's been a little bit more limited in terms of the applications because of some of the performance implications of that and that sort of thing. But we feel comfortable with where we're at in terms of SMR transition and the applicability and the drives that we're providing to our customers. Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC Congratulations and keep up the impressive results. Thank you. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Thank you, Mark. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your line is now open. Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Yes. Hi. I had a question. So, just looking at the Toshiba side, obviously, you guys are having a lot of negotiations there. Is there – do you guys have a right of first refusal? I know you have concentrates, but is there a right of first refusal and is there a time line to that process? Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. We have consent provisions, is what we have regarding any transferred assets and JV provisions, as I've mentioned earlier. Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Got it. But is there a time line to that process at all or...? Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Well, similarly, the answer to the question, I'm not going to speculate on time lines. Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Got it. And the second question is that – on the NAND side, as you look at the 14 and 64 ramp, what's the mix in the back half and what's the – how do the gross margins look? Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp. Well, we talked about our mix in the back half. It would be 75% of our 3D-bit output will be 64 layer exiting the calendar year. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. And that's for the – no, that's for the full calendar year, which means that by the time you get to the back half, the lion's share of our output in terms of 3-D is going to be 64 layer. Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Got it. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. We're already transitioning out of 48 into 64. 48 layer was more of a learning platform for us, if you want to call it that, as opposed to something that we intended to extensively productize and ship. It was really for our learnings. Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Got it. Great. Thanks a lot. Good quarter, guys. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. Thank you so much. Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp. So I want to thank everybody for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you going forward. Have a great rest of the afternoon.

Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Alan Gould - Brean Capital LLC Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Starz Third Quarter Earnings Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, October 27, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Courtnee Chun. Please go ahead. Courtnee Chun Ulrich - Starz Thank you. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call include certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about the proposed transaction with Lionsgate, statements about the anticipated synergies and benefits of the proposed transaction, revenue growth, new service offerings and original programming, new distribution platforms for our programming, subscriber growth, international distribution opportunities, the suspension of our stock repurchase plan, expectations regarding 2016 programming expense, expectations regarding 2016 adjusted OIBDA and other matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call, and Starz expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Starz's expectations with regard thereto, or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Please refer to the publicly filed documents of Starz, including our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, for additional information about Starz and about the risks and uncertainties related to Starz's business, which may affect the statements made in this presentation. During today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted OIBDA. The required definition and reconciliation can be found at the end of the PowerPoint, which you can find on our website. Now, I'd like to introduce Chris Albrecht, Starz's President and CEO. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Thank you, Courtnee. We appreciate you joining us and for your continued interest in Starz. With me today is Scott MacDonald, Starz's Chief Financial Officer. All right. Let's start with the Lionsgate transaction. As we discussed last quarter, we're confident that this transformative agreement is an excellent way to create value for our shareholders. Together, Lionsgate and Starz will form an effective powerhouse with market leading content creation capabilities, a global distribution footprint across multiple platforms, and significant corporate synergies. Working together, we'll build an even stronger Starz brand with additional financial resources and talented teams of executives at both companies who understand how to create, distribute and monetize great content. With that, let's turn to the third quarter results. Starz continued its solid operational performance in the third quarter, delivering 6% year-on-year revenue growth at Starz Networks, which is the largest increase since the second quarter of 2013. Third quarter performance also saw year-over-year subscriber growth of 1.2 million customers with 300,000 added in the quarter, setting a new record high of 24.5 million subscribers for Starz. Our commitment to creating standout programming and connecting with the viewers through both traditional and new distribution platforms is driving the growth of our business and the development of the Starz brand. Our digital distribution initiatives are performing well, complementing the way we work with traditional distributors and providing consumers with additional ways to access our highly rated content. Since launching our services on Amazon in late December 2015 and bringing to market the new STARZ app in April 2016, in 10 months, we've nearly surpassed 1 million Starz OTT subs. Our success in this area is buttressing our core Starz Network business, which continues to perform very well. Our popular content is clearly translating into strong distributor relationships. To that point, we've completed a multiyear affiliation agreement with AT&T/DIRECTV, which will now include participation in the upcoming DIRECTV Now OTT service. We look forward to great new opportunities for growth with this historically strong distribution partner that is pursuing innovative strategies to connect with consumers. Let's now turn to our original programming, where we're seeing an unprecedented demand. We delivered a record-breaking third season for Power with the highest ever multiplatform viewership performance for a STARZ Original series. Power achieved an average of 7.3 million viewers per episode. Power was a juggernaut in the premium pay-TV space, ranking at the second most watched premium pay-TV series in 2016 behind only Game of Thrones. We were also very pleased with the growth in viewership for our critically acclaimed comedy series, Survivor's Remorse from Executive Producer LeBron James. Survivor's Remorse saw a 53% increase in viewership from its first season, and we are bringing it back for a fourth season in 2017. Ash vs. Evil Dead's second season performance underscores our comedy programming growth. Strong critical acclaim and solid viewership have made the series a hit in the States. We're also seeing success internationally, highlighted by our recent deal with Amazon Germany for its Amazon Prime Video service. Anchor Bay had strong home video sales of the Ash vs. Evil Dead first season, logging the highest sales from any studio for a 30-minute episodic season one TV title since September 2010. And just last week, we announced our partnership in the global launch of Vimeo EST platform. Starz secured an agreement to bring Ash vs. Evil Dead, Black Sails and The Girlfriend Experience to Vimeo's global television marketplace in more than 150 countries worldwide. As I mentioned, our domestic Amazon Starz and STARZ app subscription business are performing very well. The STARZ app recently launched on Xbox One and Sling TV, rolled out a STARZ add-on pack for its alternative video service. We're pleased with the performance of our business. We're executing against our long-term business strategy, and our investment in original programming is resulting in increased consumer demand for Starz. We're confident that this momentum will continue as we move towards completion of the Lionsgate transaction. I will now turn the call over to Scott to discuss the financials. Scott D. MacDonald - Starz Thanks, Chris. For the third quarter, Starz's consolidated revenue was $407.8 million. Operating income was $74 million and adjusted OIBDA was $89.9 million. At Starz Networks, third quarter revenue increased 6% to $348.6 million due to higher effective rates, partially offset by lower average subscriptions due to video household losses at certain distributors. Operating income decreased 21% to $80.4 million and adjusted OIBDA decreased 18% to $92.9 million due to increased programming and advertising costs associated with our original programming and marketing costs associated with the new STARZ app, partially offset by higher revenue. As we've mentioned on previous calls, Q3 2016 was going to be the most heavily weighted quarter in 2016 in terms of our original programming lineup. In Q3 2016, we premiered a total of 22 new original episodes including Power, Survivor's Remorse and Outlander, versus a total of 12 new original episodes in Q3 2015. We expect total programming cost for 2016 to be slightly favorable compared to last year. In addition, as you may recall, Q4 2015 was our highest quarter for programming costs in 2015 with the airing of our higher costs mini-series Flesh and Bone. We expect Q4 2016 programming costs to be significantly lower than Q4 2015 with the absence of Flesh and Bone, leading to very favorable adjusted OIBDA comparison for Q4 2016. Starz Networks' cash paid for investments in films and television programs increased $27.7 million to $76.3 million due to a greater number of original series in production during the current quarter. At Starz Distribution, third quarter revenue decreased $4.7 million to $60.9 million. Operating income decreased $3.4 million to a loss of $2.5 million and adjusted OIBDA decreased $3.5 million to a loss of $1.7 million primarily as a result of fewer significant new releases from The Weinstein Company. During the third quarter, Starz Distribution's cash paid for investment in films and television programs increased $23.4 million to $26.2 million, primarily due to timing of payments for The Weinstein Company titles. At September 30, we had $268 million drawn under our revolving credit facility with $732 million of volume capacity remaining. Our leverage stood at approximately 2.4 times adjusted OIBDA. Now, I'll turn the call back to Chris. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Thanks, Scott. Before I open the call for questions, as this maybe our last independent earnings call, I want to thank you for your interest in and coverage of Starz. We believe we have delivered on the promises made to investors at our in-person Investor Meeting back in November 2013. We've reached our original programming goals and made originals the cornerstone of our growth, thereby making the entirety of Starz products and services more valuable to our viewers, global distributors, the marketplace and shareholders. We believe that we have strong momentum and are very excited with the prospects of being part of the Lionsgate family. Operator, we now open the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator And your first question comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Thank you and congratulations on the deal again. Just a question on the over-the-top subscriptions between Amazon and also the app, what's the right mix? If you could give us a split between the 1 million from Amazon and also over-the-top? And how do we think about the economics of the deal relative – of these deals relative to your linear subscription? Thank you. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Hi, Amy. So, we're contractually prohibited from giving you numbers on the Amazon subscribers. So, therefore, I can't give you that breakdown. We did launch Amazon in December. They've been marketing it very well. We launched our app in April. We've really taken a much – a less aggressive approach in the marketing of it. The response has been quite good. With regard to the economics, Amazon is a new distributor. Historically, new distributors have always paid a higher rate than the incumbent. That's one of the ways that doing business with new distributors go down easier with your long time partner. So, you can assume that there's the same kind of relationship there. And with our own app, what we tend to have is it's more of a rev share, particularly, and I'm sure you're familiar with it, with the kind of deal that Apple does. So, you can sort of figure out some of that stuff yourself, but it's a very high margin business for us, and we certainly are pleased with what we've seen so far and are very hopeful that we can not only continue, but build on the momentum. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Great. Thank you. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC Thank you. Chris, thank you for the nice farewell. My question is about the press release that you put out after the – you signed the agreement with AT&T and DIRECTV. So, it says that – okay, we understand the $40 million a year impact for one year. And then it says, following the first year of the renewal period, the impact on Starz earnings will decrease annually. Does it mean that there is another, but smaller step down in the second year after the anniversary? Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz It does not mean that. Obviously, Vasily, we can't comment on the specifics of the deal. AT&T, DIRECTV, they are going through, as you can see, from their own reports, an awful lot of changes as they look to shut down one service and migrate their subscribers from one to the other, especially when we were very highly penetrated on the one that they're shutting down, and they certainly don't seem to be doing a 100% migration. We – so the impact of the deal, where the deal is also impacted by the number of subscribers that they retain, and we don't have the window into that right now. I can say that historically, these kinds of deals include yearly escalators and one should not assume that this one doesn't. And we're now glad to have a new agreement with them and look forward to building more or new, I should say, momentum with their combined platform and really getting the Starz product not only more highly penetrated on the DIRECTV platform, but also we expect to be included in the very near future in the DIRECTV Now OTT offering as well. Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC All right. Thank you. And can you tell us if you have any visibility into what kind of subscribers you are getting through Amazon? Are those people who already have a pay TV subscription or are those people who have broadband-only households? Any kind of color would be interesting here. Thank you very much. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz One of the things that we're seeing, is that there seem to be a fair amount of broadband and mobile, broadband-only and mobile customers who are adding that service. Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC All right. Thank you. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Joyce. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. Two questions please. With the greater investment in series production in the quarter, could you talk about the series that you're working on? I know you talked about in the past of starting to go with programming to address the Hispanic audience. And when would these shows that you're producing now come on the air? And then secondly, if you could talk a little bit more about the subscriber trends, with the growth in the Starz side, but some declines on the STARZ ENCORE side of the subs, are you seeing possibly a swap out of subscribers from the traditional distributor systems to the new Amazon and app platforms? Thank you. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz It's really impossible for us to tell whether there is a switch out from the traditional to Amazon or app. I mean, it's not – I think what I've just mentioned would lead one to think that they are incremental. But we don't have any proof of that at the moment. Well, obviously, we'll have more information as we're able to get more information from our own – from the subscribers to our own app. With regard to the originals, 2017 is going to have a lot of shows. We've got Black Sails, we've got – which will be the final season; we've got The White Princess, and The Missing 2; we have Outlander Book 3; we have Power; we have Survivor's Remorse; we're premiering the first season of American Gods, which is one of the most anticipated shows; also green-lit and going into production will be Counterpart starring J.K. Simmons, from Morten Tyldum and Justin Marks, which is a show we're very excited about from our partners in MRC. We're also – we've also green-lit The Girlfriend Experience Season Two. And I'm reading a slew of scripts that are directed to the Hispanic marketplace, where we hope to have the same inroads and uptake from that demographic group that we're seeing from African-Americans with shows like Power and Survivor's Remorse. So, we have a very robust lineup of shows with a couple of shows that are going off the air like Black Sails. We're going to have the capacity to put some new shows on the air, and this strategy of serving underserved audiences is working well for us, particularly when it comes to the OTT business. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC Great. Thank you very much. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Fiftal with Morgan Stanley. Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. I have one for Chris and one for Scott, if I can. So following up on the OTT subs, obviously very strong. But I was wondering, have you seen any kind of drop off or elevated churn in October once Power finished? And I guess more broadly, how are you thinking about retention and churn management, since that was something that really use to be under the preview of the MVPDs? Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz So, very small churn. I think the way that we want to deal with that is to have – it's one thing that we're looking at in 2017, to have something new every month. So instead of something new every quarter, have something new every month. And that doesn't necessarily mean that we have to increase our programming budget to do that. It has a lot to do with how we license shows, buy shows, retain rights, the different way that we access content. But it's clear to us that putting something on the air is the best way to make noise with that audience and then getting them and having them not just experience a show that they might have signed up for, but to take a look at the deep breadth of content, both originals and movie library content that's on the service and, plus the features is a good way to keep them, so that's as best as I can answer that right now. Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. And then it may be too early, but have you guys started to think about or deploy things like retention discounts or retention marketing or anything along those lines? Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz No. Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. And then - Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz No. It's not, yeah, this is going well. Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yeah. Okay. And then one for Scott if I can, so your color on 2016 programming cost was very helpful, so since no deed goes unpunished, I'll see if I can squeeze some help on 2017 too. So I'm wondering, programming in 2017, I would think with Disney costs rolling off, you would see some declines, but in the merger filings with the management plan detail, it showed I think, not a lot, but low single-digit type growth in programming costs in 2017. So any help how we should think about that? Is it that originals are really going to more than offset that kind of benefit next year? Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Well, Scott can answer. Look, I think we look at all. I mean, it's hard to know what the output costs are going to be until you get the movies in. We look at all of the resources, all of the revenue that we get for the company and we look to allocate it against what we think we need to spend and where we need to spend it to get the best results for the company and therefore for the shareholders. So there's no formula for how much money Disney is going to save us in any one given year because there's really been no specific number for Disney in any one specific year. I don't know, Scott, you want to add to that? Scott D. MacDonald - Starz I think you kind of hit it on the head. I mean it really is hard to tell what the output costs are going to be. For example, in 2016, they're coming in much more favorable than we had anticipated. So, it's really kind of a little early on that to provide any more color. Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. But it's at least feasible that original's expense could be up enough to offset whatever that Disney bogey is? Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Yeah. I mean, if the original cost is the cost of the programming plus the marketing, then certainly we're going to look to take money that we're not spending on Disney movies and spend it on things that we think drive the business a lot more effectively than the Disney movies, and that would include marketing those. And not just marketing the programs, but marketing the service as we're going to want to do more on a year-round basis with our own OTT app. Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ben Mogil with Stifel. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, one for Chris and one for Scott. Chris, when you look at the sub growth, if you would have sort of isolate the transition from U-verse to AT&T, do you think MVPD subs would have been kind of flattish roughly speaking? Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz You mean taking that out? Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yeah. Like if you sort of leave that aside because that's obviously disruptive because of a merger, were generally the other operators generally seeing kind of flattish MVPD growth? Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz I think we would have seen – again this is – the drag on our subscriber numbers from the merging of those two platforms was significant. And therefore, it goes to blunt a lot of what would have been a different story when it came to the OTT, Amazon, STARZ app numbers. So, well I can't say it would have been flat, because I don't know – it's hard to – it could have been up. I mean, they're losing a fair – they are losing a fair amount of people in this transition and we're looking forward to the time when it's over. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Are you finding that like you've had constructive conversations with them about it? And I know your peers are sort of seeing the same transition issue. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Obviously, premium is different than the basic channels. And, we were still highly penetrated in AT&T, that you have like, almost three times – or not quite three times, but certainly two-and-a-half times or nearly two-and-a-half times as much penetration on the U-verse platform. I – without divulging anything, I know that we're not alone in this, in this effect in the premium space. I can't speak to what's happening in the basic space. Scott, do you want to add anything? Scott D. MacDonald - Starz Well, I would just say STARZ, the STARZ service has performed very well, both in our traditional affiliates with the exception of Chris' discussion of the transition on the U-verse platform. We performed incredibly well, both OTT and traditional. And, if you – and really on STARZ ENCORE, there's more to that. There has been a drag not only from the merger, but you've also had just a couple of distributors and how they're packaging the service. And they're really not marketing those packages. So, that's had a further drag on the STARZ ENCORE side. But Starz, I mean, has just done really well, even with those headwinds from the AT&T and DIRECTV – AT&T/DIRECTV transition. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. That's' great. Thank you very much. And then, sort of one for Scott. I just want to make sure I've got sort of the right number we're talking about here. When you talked about programming cost for 2016 being slightly down, you're talking about it against the $656 million number from 2015. Is that the right number to be sort of starting the conversation with? Scott D. MacDonald - Starz Correct. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. And in terms of total OpEx, which I think was around $1.3 million last year, should we sort of assume it to be flat to slightly up? Scott D. MacDonald - Starz On total OpEx, I don't think we are prepared to providing you guidance on that. I mean, suffice it to say the programming costs, we expect them to be favorable to last year, and I think if you look at the programming cost, it's really like you're flipping quarters. Last year, we had Flesh and Bone in Q4, that was a heavily – most heavily-weighted quarter for programming; the opposite this year. So overall, again, as I mentioned, I think, on a previous question, we've seen favorability in output. And so, overall programming costs are are going to be coming in lower. You can kind of look at relative proxy by flipping the quarter year-over-year there. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. That's great. That's really helpful. Thanks again. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Thanks, Ben. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on your run, guys. I wanted to ask a little bit about this filing, the $40 million kind of step-down in revenues from AT&T/DIRECTV. In that filing, you talked about, to some degree, this will be offset by new digital revenues and other revenues. And I was kind of curious, those digital revenues and other revenues, were you talking about just revenues from AT&T/DIRECTV or were you talking more broadly about things that would include maybe that DIRECTV Now as well as growth in the OTT through Amazon and the app? Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Yeah. We were talking more broadly. I mean, we certainly look to have productive conversations in growing our business with AT&T/DIRECTV, but that statement was directed at Starz's entire business. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay. All right. Now, the sub growth on the Starz OTT stuff is great in that, it seems to be of anything faster than Showtime. But one of the things you guys had was the biggest movie ever, The Force Awakens, come on the service, promoted on Prime, at least from what I could see. Was that a meaningful thing or there's still much more important – the interest in Power and Survivor's Remorse and the biggest movie ever? Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz You would be surprised at how not a meaningful thing it was. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Wow. Okay. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Which, I think, really just goes to underscore the fact that movies are now tonnage, they're a foundation of the premium services, Netflix also and the things that are driving people to be interested in our products are the things that we are making ourselves for them. So, shows like Power, shows like Outlander, Ash vs. Evil Dead, these are shows that are targeted to specific groups with technology that is attractive to them at prices that are affordable for them in a packaging architecture that is easily accessed by them. So, the more of these we have, the more will come back, the more the people will come back and the more control we have over our own programming lineup because as we can see from the movies business, and as has been historical, we are at the mercy, may not be exactly the right word, but we are depending on the studios to make big movies. And by the time a film like Star Wars comes to the air, aside from all the people that have seen it in the theater and have seen it on-demand or EST, it is not the same. It does not have the same impact when it comes to premium. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Yeah. And just one other final thing. Did the announcement of the merger have a negative impact on any parts of your business? For instance, I know the Distribution segment was a little bit soft although Weinstein was a part of that. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz No. I think the Starz worldwide distribution team, Anchor Bay, have great long-term relationships with the end users outside the U.S., with the big-box retailers here in the U.S. We have the kind of products that they're looking for. Obviously, there's going to be more that we can do in a combined company around monetizing those rights, but really the distribution did miss. When we made the Weinstein deal, it was a deal that was designed to help us pay the overhead for the company, give us titles to include in our briefcase of things to sell, but we always knew that the things that were going to distinguish the brand and that were going to be really the high-priced items on a consistent basis, were hopefully going to be the originals. The Weinsteins have been in a lull, I'll say, when it comes to not only being able to provide us with a consistent output but with an output that has brought us a movie like a King's Speech or like... Scott D. MacDonald - Starz Hateful Eight. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Like a Hateful Eight or the other. Scott D. MacDonald - Starz Django. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Yeah, Django Unchained. So, those drive a lot of revenue, not a lot of OIBDA given the fact that we have a distribution-only deal with The Weinstein Company. And also, we have a distribution-only deal with AMC and a lot of people are watching Walking Dead on television; doesn't mean a lot of people are buying Walking Dead DVDs. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay. All right. Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Thank you, Barton. Operator And your final question comes from the line of Alan Gould with Brean Capital. Alan Gould - Brean Capital LLC Thank you. Chris, I've got three questions for you. First, I realize it's early, but can you give any comment on what the impact the AT&T/Time Warner deal might have on you guys? Second, could you tell us what sort of gating factors are remaining before between now and completing the Lionsgate deal? And third, what are your general views of licensing content, your original content after they're done their run on Starz onto the OTT platforms? Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Look, the AT&T/Time Warner is a massive deal. It's at the beginning of the process. It's going to be a long process and it's anyone's guess what happens. Having been part of one giant merger between Timer Warner and another company that started with A, these things are extremely difficult. But there's no one smarter than Jeff Bewkes. So, he will be a major factor there. We're excited about it from the point of view that we think it highlights the value of content and companies that create their own content and have the platforms to distribute their own content and Starz is right there. Even though we'll be combined with Lionsgate, we'll still be an independent company capable of partnering and making unique kind of deals to grow our company, to monetize that content. With regard to the merger itself, we can't give any specifics, but we do think we're on track to close the deal this year. And what was your last question? Alan Gould - Brean Capital LLC What's your view on licensing your original content after they're done on. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz So, I think we're going to follow the same, for the foreseeable future, we're going to follow the same paradigm that we've seen or that have been set for premium so far, which is in later, if a show is going three, four, or five seasons, as you get past season three, maybe you make an SVOD deal to release one season at a time to help monetize that, bring new people. It's somewhat like the old syndication model in television except without dumping all of the seasons at the same time. So, hopefully you're bringing new viewers and, therefore, new customers to new seasons that would be seen exclusively on Starz. And then certainly, once a show is no longer on Starz, we'd be willing to license it. But in all of those cases, we're only interested in licensing things non-exclusively so that we can always maintain these assets on the Starz platform, in the STARZ app, as part of the Starz's library for Starz subscribers to enjoy whether they're seeing it for the first time or whether they want to go back and revisit favorite shows or films that they have as well. Alan Gould - Brean Capital LLC Have you licensed Power or Survivor's Remorse yet? Scott D. MacDonald - Starz To – well... Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz It was licensed outside to U.S., to no one inside U.S. Alan Gould - Brean Capital LLC Okay. Thank you very much. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Thank you and thank you for your interest in Starz. Hopefully, we won't be talking again. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator And your first question comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Thank you and congratulations on the deal again. Just a question on the over-the-top subscriptions between Amazon and also the app, what's the right mix? If you could give us a split between the 1 million from Amazon and also over-the-top? And how do we think about the economics of the deal relative – of these deals relative to your linear subscription? Thank you. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Hi, Amy. So, we're contractually prohibited from giving you numbers on the Amazon subscribers. So, therefore, I can't give you that breakdown. We did launch Amazon in December. They've been marketing it very well. We launched our app in April. We've really taken a much – a less aggressive approach in the marketing of it. The response has been quite good. With regard to the economics, Amazon is a new distributor. Historically, new distributors have always paid a higher rate than the incumbent. That's one of the ways that doing business with new distributors go down easier with your long time partner. So, you can assume that there's the same kind of relationship there. And with our own app, what we tend to have is it's more of a rev share, particularly, and I'm sure you're familiar with it, with the kind of deal that Apple does. So, you can sort of figure out some of that stuff yourself, but it's a very high margin business for us, and we certainly are pleased with what we've seen so far and are very hopeful that we can not only continue, but build on the momentum. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Great. Thank you. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC Thank you. Chris, thank you for the nice farewell. My question is about the press release that you put out after the – you signed the agreement with AT&T and DIRECTV. So, it says that – okay, we understand the $40 million a year impact for one year. And then it says, following the first year of the renewal period, the impact on Starz earnings will decrease annually. Does it mean that there is another, but smaller step down in the second year after the anniversary? Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz It does not mean that. Obviously, Vasily, we can't comment on the specifics of the deal. AT&T, DIRECTV, they are going through, as you can see, from their own reports, an awful lot of changes as they look to shut down one service and migrate their subscribers from one to the other, especially when we were very highly penetrated on the one that they're shutting down, and they certainly don't seem to be doing a 100% migration. We – so the impact of the deal, where the deal is also impacted by the number of subscribers that they retain, and we don't have the window into that right now. I can say that historically, these kinds of deals include yearly escalators and one should not assume that this one doesn't. And we're now glad to have a new agreement with them and look forward to building more or new, I should say, momentum with their combined platform and really getting the Starz product not only more highly penetrated on the DIRECTV platform, but also we expect to be included in the very near future in the DIRECTV Now OTT offering as well. Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC All right. Thank you. And can you tell us if you have any visibility into what kind of subscribers you are getting through Amazon? Are those people who already have a pay TV subscription or are those people who have broadband-only households? Any kind of color would be interesting here. Thank you very much. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz One of the things that we're seeing, is that there seem to be a fair amount of broadband and mobile, broadband-only and mobile customers who are adding that service. Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC All right. Thank you. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Joyce. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. Two questions please. With the greater investment in series production in the quarter, could you talk about the series that you're working on? I know you talked about in the past of starting to go with programming to address the Hispanic audience. And when would these shows that you're producing now come on the air? And then secondly, if you could talk a little bit more about the subscriber trends, with the growth in the Starz side, but some declines on the STARZ ENCORE side of the subs, are you seeing possibly a swap out of subscribers from the traditional distributor systems to the new Amazon and app platforms? Thank you. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz It's really impossible for us to tell whether there is a switch out from the traditional to Amazon or app. I mean, it's not – I think what I've just mentioned would lead one to think that they are incremental. But we don't have any proof of that at the moment. Well, obviously, we'll have more information as we're able to get more information from our own – from the subscribers to our own app. With regard to the originals, 2017 is going to have a lot of shows. We've got Black Sails, we've got – which will be the final season; we've got The White Princess, and The Missing 2; we have Outlander Book 3; we have Power; we have Survivor's Remorse; we're premiering the first season of American Gods, which is one of the most anticipated shows; also green-lit and going into production will be Counterpart starring J.K. Simmons, from Morten Tyldum and Justin Marks, which is a show we're very excited about from our partners in MRC. We're also – we've also green-lit The Girlfriend Experience Season Two. And I'm reading a slew of scripts that are directed to the Hispanic marketplace, where we hope to have the same inroads and uptake from that demographic group that we're seeing from African-Americans with shows like Power and Survivor's Remorse. So, we have a very robust lineup of shows with a couple of shows that are going off the air like Black Sails.

Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay. All right. Now, the sub growth on the Starz OTT stuff is great in that, it seems to be of anything faster than Showtime. But one of the things you guys had was the biggest movie ever, The Force Awakens, come on the service, promoted on Prime, at least from what I could see. Was that a meaningful thing or there's still much more important – the interest in Power and Survivor's Remorse and the biggest movie ever? Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz You would be surprised at how not a meaningful thing it was. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Wow. Okay. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Which, I think, really just goes to underscore the fact that movies are now tonnage, they're a foundation of the premium services, Netflix also and the things that are driving people to be interested in our products are the things that we are making ourselves for them. So, shows like Power, shows like Outlander, Ash vs. Evil Dead, these are shows that are targeted to specific groups with technology that is attractive to them at prices that are affordable for them in a packaging architecture that is easily accessed by them. So, the more of these we have, the more will come back, the more the people will come back and the more control we have over our own programming lineup because as we can see from the movies business, and as has been historical, we are at the mercy, may not be exactly the right word, but we are depending on the studios to make big movies. And by the time a film like Star Wars comes to the air, aside from all the people that have seen it in the theater and have seen it on-demand or EST, it is not the same. It does not have the same impact when it comes to premium. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Yeah. And just one other final thing. Did the announcement of the merger have a negative impact on any parts of your business? For instance, I know the Distribution segment was a little bit soft although Weinstein was a part of that. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz No. I think the Starz worldwide distribution team, Anchor Bay, have great long-term relationships with the end users outside the U.S., with the big-box retailers here in the U.S. We have the kind of products that they're looking for. Obviously, there's going to be more that we can do in a combined company around monetizing those rights, but really the distribution did miss. When we made the Weinstein deal, it was a deal that was designed to help us pay the overhead for the company, give us titles to include in our briefcase of things to sell, but we always knew that the things that were going to distinguish the brand and that were going to be really the high-priced items on a consistent basis, were hopefully going to be the originals. The Weinsteins have been in a lull, I'll say, when it comes to not only being able to provide us with a consistent output but with an output that has brought us a movie like a King's Speech or like... Scott D. MacDonald - Starz Hateful Eight. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Like a Hateful Eight or the other. Scott D. MacDonald - Starz Django. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Yeah, Django Unchained. So, those drive a lot of revenue, not a lot of OIBDA given the fact that we have a distribution-only deal with The Weinstein Company. And also, we have a distribution-only deal with AMC and a lot of people are watching Walking Dead on television; doesn't mean a lot of people are buying Walking Dead DVDs. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay. All right. Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Thank you, Barton. Operator And your final question comes from the line of Alan Gould with Brean Capital. Alan Gould - Brean Capital LLC Thank you. Chris, I've got three questions for you. First, I realize it's early, but can you give any comment on what the impact the AT&T/Time Warner deal might have on you guys? Second, could you tell us what sort of gating factors are remaining before between now and completing the Lionsgate deal? And third, what are your general views of licensing content, your original content after they're done their run on Starz onto the OTT platforms? Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Look, the AT&T/Time Warner is a massive deal. It's at the beginning of the process. It's going to be a long process and it's anyone's guess what happens. Having been part of one giant merger between Timer Warner and another company that started with A, these things are extremely difficult. But there's no one smarter than Jeff Bewkes. So, he will be a major factor there. We're excited about it from the point of view that we think it highlights the value of content and companies that create their own content and have the platforms to distribute their own content and Starz is right there. Even though we'll be combined with Lionsgate, we'll still be an independent company capable of partnering and making unique kind of deals to grow our company, to monetize that content. With regard to the merger itself, we can't give any specifics, but we do think we're on track to close the deal this year. And what was your last question? Alan Gould - Brean Capital LLC What's your view on licensing your original content after they're done on. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz So, I think we're going to follow the same, for the foreseeable future, we're going to follow the same paradigm that we've seen or that have been set for premium so far, which is in later, if a show is going three, four, or five seasons, as you get past season three, maybe you make an SVOD deal to release one season at a time to help monetize that, bring new people. It's somewhat like the old syndication model in television except without dumping all of the seasons at the same time. So, hopefully you're bringing new viewers and, therefore, new customers to new seasons that would be seen exclusively on Starz. And then certainly, once a show is no longer on Starz, we'd be willing to license it. But in all of those cases, we're only interested in licensing things non-exclusively so that we can always maintain these assets on the Starz platform, in the STARZ app, as part of the Starz's library for Starz subscribers to enjoy whether they're seeing it for the first time or whether they want to go back and revisit favorite shows or films that they have as well. Alan Gould - Brean Capital LLC Have you licensed Power or Survivor's Remorse yet? Scott D. MacDonald - Starz To – well... Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz It was licensed outside to U.S., to no one inside U.S. Alan Gould - Brean Capital LLC Okay. Thank you very much. Christopher P. Albrecht - Starz Thank you and thank you for your interest in Starz. Hopefully, we won't be talking again. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

My name is Ian, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Jonathan Doros, you may begin your conference. Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our call to discuss our fourth quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings results. We've posted the earnings materials and prepared remarks to our Investor Relations Events webpage. Speakers on today's call are Greg Clark, Symantec's CEO; and Nick Noviello, Executive Vice President and CFO. This is a live call that will be available for replay via webcast on our website. I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics are non-GAAP, unless otherwise stated. We provide year-over-year constant currency growth rates in our prepared remarks for revenue. During the call we may speak to growth adjusted for acquisitions metric, which includes prior period non-GAAP revenue from acquisitions adjusted for Symantec's accounting policies including quarterization. All non-GAAP revenue and expenses exclude the impact of Veritas, however the continuing operations deferred revenue on the balance sheet includes a portion of Veritas deferred revenue from Symantec and Veritas bundled contracts entered into prior to operational separation. The Veritas deferred revenue from those contracts will amortize into discontinued operations. As a result implied billings growth calculated from the change in deferred on the balance sheet will not be representative of stand-alone Symantec's performance as it will include an impact from Veritas. Please note, non-GAAP financial measures referenced during this call are reconciled to their comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website. We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides a meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance for reasons discussed below. Our management team uses those non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and annualizing future periods. We believe those non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods and to our peers and that investors benefit from understanding of the non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Today's call contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and, as such, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information. You will also find a detailed discussion about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC and, in particular, on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 30, 2016. We would like to remind everyone that we'll be hosting a Financial Analyst Day on June 8. Further details are available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Greg Clark. Go ahead Greg. Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Thank you for joining us. Fiscal 2017 was a transformative year at Symantec with substantial improvement across the entire company. Fiscal 2018 marks the second half of our execution plan to fundamentally transform Symantec's enterprise and consumer businesses addressing both revenue growth and profitability. Today, we announced our Q4 fiscal year 2017 results. And we're also raising our fiscal 2018 EPS outlook to $1.75 to $1.85. I will recap our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results, update you on our progress within Enterprise Security and Consumer Security segments, discuss our transformation and cost savings commitments, and our CFO, Nick Noviello, will provide more details on our financial results and fiscal 2018 outlook. Beginning with Q4, our results demonstrate strong and consistent execution relative to our expectations. During the quarter, we saw further evidence that our investments and commitments to innovation are distinguishing us as the leader in cyber security for the cloud generation. Let me highlight a few key areas from the quarter. Our overall Q4 business activity was strong and consistent with our expectations. And within Enterprise Security, we saw a faster than expected increase in mix towards cloud subscription and virtual appliances. We believe this product mix shift is a positive for our business both financially and strategically, is a proof that our customers are designing Symantec into their future cloud security architectures. Enterprise Security profitability has improved dramatically with Q4 fiscal year 2017 operating margins up 17 points year over year. Consumer Security revenue growth performed better than our guidance, and LifeLock came in above our revenue expectations as well. Overall, we continued to perform ahead of plan on our cost efficiencies and synergies. Total company margins were at the high end of our guidance. And as a result, we delivered EPS at the high end of our guidance, excluding LifeLock. Now turning to our Enterprise business, we are combining best of breed product innovation with unmatched scale. This is leading to significant competitive advantage and differentiates us in the market as the leading cyber security provider for enterprises. During the fourth quarter, business activity was strong. We are pleased to report Enterprise Security grew 2% organically in the quarter. The business activity of our Blue Coat products were in line with our expectations at above-market growth. And we hit a big milestone in Q4, as we have achieved feature parity between our network products delivered through an appliance and its corollary in the cloud. We now have the leading software elements across relevant deployment methods: appliances, virtual appliances, and pure cloud. During the quarter, we doubled the number of cloud proxy competitive wins versus our next largest cloud competitor. And we are pleased that we saw accelerating demand for cloud and subscription solutions. Selling more cloud solutions is a positive indicator for future success. This has an effect on end period revenue with the benefit of increased deferred revenue. The Blue Coat subscription offerings are now approaching $100 million revenue run rate, growing 67% year on year in the fourth quarter with business activity more than doubling on an annualized basis. Now on to Consumer Security results for Q4 fiscal year 2017; Consumer Security exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance on an organic basis, and LifeLock performed above revenue expectations with strong underlying growth metrics. LifeLock renewal rates increased year over year and cumulative ending members were up 8% year over year. This is an impressive result amidst the significant acquisition and integration activity. Moving to the full year fiscal 2017, the results show improving revenue performance and delivered ahead of plan on operating efficiency, while we are, at the same time, integrating our transformative acquisitions. Nick will cover the full year fiscal year 2017 details in his remarks. Now let me turn to the strategic progress we are making in Enterprise Security. Our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform is clearly resonating with customers. We believe our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform provides the security reference architecture for the future of IT environments whether on premise, software defined or in a pure cloud delivery model. The strength of our platform begins with a strong commitment to leading cyber defense intelligence. As we have commented on previously, the integration of Blue Coat and Symantec threat intelligence has created a differentiated lens into the threat landscape. An example of our artificial intelligence adding significant value with this data is now resulting in blocking an additional 3.2 million attacks every day. We expect more advancements from our artificial intelligence as we further integrate our network and endpoint data. Our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform ingests this threat intelligence and combines it with robust integrated functionality across our user, web, information, and messaging solutions. Turning to a representative customer example, recently one of the world's largest food and drug retailers with over 60,000 users embarked upon an initiative to move to the cloud and upgrade their security infrastructure. Our sales team moved the conversation with the customer from speaking about a combination of point solutions to articulating the benefits of our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform. We delivered a solution that improved the customer's security posture and reduced their expense. Given the increased Symantec footprint, this customer is now paying approximately 60% more to Symantec but reduced their overall security spend by an estimated 25% and took a major step forward in their security posture. We expect these type of win-win opportunities to be commonplace as companies are looking for integrated platforms as they struggle with technology sprawl and runaway costs due to isolated point vendors. Now let me highlight our leadership in cloud security. In order for the enterprise customer to take advantage of the cloud, security solutions must be incorporated that reduce the risks inherent in the cloud generation. All of our major solutions are now delivering in the cloud and designed for the new risks our customers are facing. For example, we have an industry-leading approach to securing cloud applications. We have combined cloud proxy, CASB, Data Loss Prevention, and multi-factor authentication into one complete offering that addresses these new risks. We believe we are the only company that has all of these major components and we'll enjoy this position for the foreseeable future. When compared to the alternatives of an internal IT shop procuring and integrating multiple solutions from point vendors, we are an obvious choice. In Q4 we saw a substantial traction with our entire cloud security portfolio. As an example of our success, during the quarter we won a large deal at a major technology services company that is undergoing a cloud transformation. The customer took the first steps in adopting this platform for their internal environment with the purchase of our cloud proxy and DLP. This was a highly competitive win and a massive endorsement to our strength in cloud security given how cloud-centric IT services organizations are today. We see many deals in the pipeline that are similar in nature. Turning to our endpoint security solution, endpoint security is a key component of our platform and its success has resulted in customers cross buying additional components of our cyber defense platform. In Q4, we saw continued success with SEP 14 from both a product and sales standpoint. SEP 14 detection rates have improved 26% compared to SEP 12. Competitive wins are increasing and SEP 14 has not witnessed a significant technical loss. For example we replaced a major competitor at a large financial services company. There were multiple drivers of the win including SEP integration with ProxySG and our superior machine learning capabilities. The competitive landscape is turning in our favor with a leading-market share endpoint vendor removed from a third party endpoint leadership quadrant as well as smaller endpoint providers experiencing some recent significant missteps. Overall we see signs of increasing win rates and expect renewal metrics to improve over the medium term. In addition, Endpoint Detection and Response, EDR, is an important part of the endpoint market that is garnering attention from customers. The next release of our converged endpoint plus EDR solution is launching soon. As we introduce this new version of converged endpoint plus EDR into our installed base, we expect to have a similar impact to the current point EDR solution vendors as SEP 14 is having on point machine learning and exploit prevention vendors. For example, during the fourth quarter we closed a nearly 180,000 endpoint win with a large IT services company that included our EDR and endpoint security. The customer was overwhelmed with the high volume of alerts across 40 countries and was seeking to consolidate their endpoint security to a single vendor. We won due to our strong technology and single agent architecture. This win involved replacing two competitors out of our customer's endpoint environment. We have made strong progress in EDR and are pleased with our first year in the market closing approximately 600 customers. We believe, given our rapid adoption, we are already a meaningful player in the EDR market one year after launch. This is an example of our competitive advantage enabled by our platform. In summary on endpoint progress, the power of our platform improves the security posture of our customers while enabling them to drive down their overall security cost per employee. The combination of cloud proxy, CASB, DLP, and multi-factor authentication enables the cloud generation. With SEP 14, we are now the leading next generation endpoint provider and will further extend our leadership with the introduction of the converged endpoint and EDR. Now onto our Consumer Security segment, the acquisition of LifeLock was a catalyst that expanded the business on to a new market category of Consumer Digital Safety. We believe digital safety increases our addressable market to an estimated $10 billion growing in the high single digits. We have expanded our value proposition by offering a comprehensive digital safety solution that delivers more value to the customer than PC malware protection alone and protects all aspects of a consumer's digital life including their information, identities, devices, homes and families. In addition, we now have a much larger demand generation budget for enhancing our brand and driving new customer acquisitions. We expect this competitive differentiation will fuel sustainable long-term growth in new customers and retention metrics. During the quarter we are already seeing signs that the strategy is working. Norton results were better than our outlook driven by renewal metrics and new products such as mobile solutions and privacy technology. We see a significant opportunity to deliver more value to our loyal customers which we will expand upon in more detail at the Financial Analyst Day. At a high level, there are multiple growth drivers that underpin our digital safety strategy. Let me outline the major components. First, leverage our larger demand generation. By combining Norton and LifeLock we have substantially increased our demand generation engine that can inform the market of our expanded value proposition. Our combined demand generation spend nearly triples compared to Norton stand-alone, and we expect it will provide greater economies of scale. For example, we recently rolled out a co-branded marketing campaign by leveraging LifeLock's existing paid TV and radio advertising spend. Second, transitioning to a digital safety offering. Another lever for growth is transitioning our loyal Norton customer base to our digital safety bundle We began our journey to digital safety by cross selling new offerings such as Wi-Fi privacy and our upcoming home IT security and next generation parental control solution, Norton Core. We have already begun the preliminary phases of cross selling Norton into the LifeLock base through a referral process. And in June, we plan to begin to cross-sell the LifeLock and Norton bundle, which we believe has potential to drive upside to our current outlook. As a reminder, identity protection customers pay 2 to 3 times more for protecting their identity than the average selling price of PC malware protection. We were purposely measured in our cross-sell launch of LifeLock into the Norton base to ensure our internal systems and processes were tightly aligned. Moreover, with approximately 50% of the Norton installed base outside the U.S., international expansion of the digital safety bundle is a large opportunity. Third, mobile security. Mobile users increased 50% year over year driven by both Android and iOS growth. In April, we signed an agreement with a large international telco to deliver Norton Mobile protection for their customer base, which is a new route to over 43 million wireless subscribers. We are also seeing an uptick in demand of mobile private VPN due to recent legislation that permits ISPs to share customers' internet activity. Finally, Norton Core, which has the potential to be a significant growth driver. Norton Core is an exciting extension to our digital safety platform. We are seeing continued strong reception from partners and industry participants. We expect the combined consumer business to reach growth adjusted for acquisitions by the first half of fiscal 2018. We plan to accomplish this while maintaining industry leading profitability, which provides us with the flexibility to continue investing in driving long term growth in our Consumer Digital Safety business. Turning to recent developments related to our website security solution. As you may be aware, in late March, Google put forth a proposal that, if implemented, would introduce major changes to the processes and operations that are standard across our industry, including our Certificate Authority business. Since that time, we've been engaged in conversations with Google, Mozilla, and other members of the CA community to seek input on our counter proposal that we believe minimizes business disruption for our customers and improves trust in Symantec's CA business. We believe we will find a mutually agreeable path forward that is in the best interest of our customers, and we expect discussions around our proposal to continue and have factored our current expectations around this headwind into our financial outlook. Now, I would like to address the transformation of the overall Symantec business and our operational commitments. We indicated there was a strong industrial logic to our transformation. Exiting fiscal 2017, we believe this industrial logic is materializing across the business. Last June, we committed to a set of cost savings and synergies. We're achieving these savings at a faster pace than originally anticipated and we are ahead of plan exiting fiscal 2017. Exiting fiscal 2017, the financial profile of Symantec has substantially improved from what would have been the picture not even a year ago. For example, Enterprise Security operating margins improved from 5% in fiscal year 2016 to 13% in fiscal year 2017 and we are forecasting exiting fiscal year 2018 with over 30% enterprise operating margins. Fiscal 2018 begins the second half of our execution plan to fundamentally transform Symantec across both revenue growth and increased profitability. As we exit fiscal year 2018, at the highest level, we expect organic revenue growth for each of our segments, and total organic revenue growth for the company in the mid-single digits with market leading operating margins, in Enterprise Security above 30% and in Consumer Security above 40%. We are entering the year with significant operational improvements in our go-to-market processes and have simplified the demand chain and programs to our partners reducing substantial complexity across the business. We have made substantial transformational changes in our Enterprise Security segment related to SKUs, price lists, partners and systems. And today, we have a very capable and proven team that can navigate integration complexity and continue to focus on disciplined operational execution. We have combined two quota carrying sales forces thus increasing our productive sales capacity. From the close of the Blue Coat transaction through the end of fiscal year 2017, we effectively maintained the equivalent of 2 sales reps per named account, with divided territories. Over the last nine months, we have worked to align our sales capacity more efficiently. We are confident that our efforts are already translating to results, however, we believe it is prudent to begin the fiscal year 2018 Q1 with modest close rate assumptions, allowing for additional sales capacity to take effect. In summary, the new Symantec has established significant competitive differentiation, which allows us the financial flexibility to maximize our investment in cyber security, which greatly benefits our customers, employees and shareholders. The industrial logic around the Symantec and Blue Coat combination is stronger than ever, and we are combining leading product innovation with unmatched scale, which in our view, is leading to significant competitive advantages. The Integrated Cyber Defense Platform is resonating with customers and the opportunities to significantly expand our wallet share are materializing. We have transformed our Consumer business from PC malware protection to Consumer Digital Safety. This brings significant competitive differentiation and we expect will fuel sustainable long-term growth. We are forecasting that our Norton customers will purchase LifeLock, hence, returning the consumer business to organic growth. We are on track to deliver long-term sustainable growth with leading profitability across both our Enterprise Security and Consumer segments. And we are on track with our expectations to exit fiscal 2018 with organic growth accelerating into the mid single digits with total non-GAAP operating margins over 35%. Now, I will turn the call over to Nick to provide more financial detail. Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp. Thank you Greg and good afternoon everyone. Today I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2017 financial results. I will give you context to our segment performance and our cost savings, synergies and the substantial integration, transformation and business process changes we are executing as we round out fiscal year 2017 and enter fiscal year 2018. And I will review with you details around our fiscal year 2018 and first quarter fiscal year 2018 financial outlook. We have also made additional details including reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures such as amortization of intangibles and stock based compensation available in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. Before I review our results, I would like to remind you that our Q4 and fiscal year 2017 financial guidance provided on February 1 did not include a contribution from the LifeLock acquisition, which subsequently closed on February 9. In our prepared remarks last quarter, we stated that we expected LifeLock to contribute just under $100 million of revenue for the stub period in our Q4, and be $0.01 dilutive to Symantec earnings per share. Let me start with an overview of our Q4 financial results. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP revenue was $1.176 billion, up 36% on a constant currency basis. For the stub period, LifeLock contributed $100 million to revenue during the quarter, which was slightly better than our expectations. Excluding LifeLock, revenue was $1.076 billion compared to our guidance of $1.070 billion to $1.090 billion. While business activity was consistent with our expectations for Q4, we saw the subscription mix within our Blue Coat products above expectations, which had an impact on end period revenue in the quarter. I will expand upon this later in more detail. Overall organic revenue performance was approximately flat, excluding revenue from the Blue Coat and LifeLock acquisitions, with better than expected results in Consumer Security, and growth in Enterprise Security. This is an improvement of 6 points compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 27%. Excluding LifeLock, our operating margin was 29%, at the high end of our guided range of 27% to 29%. Operationally, our strong non-GAAP operating margin was driven by continued execution against our cost savings initiatives and synergies. Fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.28 and included a $0.01 headwind from LifeLock as we anticipated. Excluding LifeLock, fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.29, at the high end of our $0.27 to $0.29 guidance range. GAAP earnings per share reflects two elements that were not incorporated in our prior guidance. First, our preliminary valuation of LifeLock, and the related purchase price adjustments, such as revenue and intangibles, and other items we do not include in our non-GAAP earnings. And second, stock based compensation expense, relating not only to LifeLock, but also our alignment of our performance based executive compensation with shareholder interests. Fully diluted shares outstanding increased by 5 million shares to 663 million shares relative to our guidance of 658 million shares, due to the impact from our convertible notes, driven by increased share price and the timing of our share repurchase program. Please see the dilution tables posted to our Investor Relations website where you can see the impact to diluted share count from the convertible notes at various stock prices. Finally, cash from operations during the quarter was $353 million. Now let's review our operating segment performance for Q4 in a bit more detail; first, I'll review the performance of Enterprise Security. Our Enterprise Security segment non-GAAP revenue was $689 million and grew 49% year over year. Excluding acquisitions, Enterprise Security organically grew 2%. Enterprise non-GAAP operating margin was 16%, up 17 points year over year. As Greg stated, we believe our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform will improve the security posture of our customers and considerably reduces their per user cyber security costs, while at the same time increasing our annual wallet share per employee. As we evolve our business to selling integrated solutions, it will become more challenging to delineate growth by each product line on a quarterly basis. That said, we are clearly seeing an improvement in our underlying business. Let me provide three examples of products within our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform. During the fourth quarter, endpoint security grew in the low single digits year over year. .cloud, our SaaS based email security grew over 20% year over year and total email has now inflected to growth of 7%. For the 11 months through the end of our fiscal year, revenue related to Blue Coat products is up 10% year over year. At our Financial Analyst Day, we will discuss metrics that are aligned to how we are managing the business going forward, with examples to show how we are increasing wallet share per protected user through cross buying of our platform, while enabling our customers to improve their security postures through use of our products. Now turning to Consumer Security, our Consumer Security segment non-GAAP revenue for Q4 was $487 million and grew 21% year over year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 42%. Excluding LifeLock, Consumer Security was down 3%, which improved sequentially from the third quarter and versus our guidance of down 4% to down 3%. The improved revenue performance was mainly driven by continued improvement in Norton renewal metrics and to a lesser extent a tailwind from new offerings. LifeLock contributed $100 million to revenue which was higher than our expectations for the stub period. The underlying LifeLock metrics were strong and we have included a summary in the CFO commentary for your review. Now turning to a summary of fiscal year 2017, overall, fiscal year 2017 was a year of important change for our business. As Greg indicated, we are driving significant integration, transformation and business process change across the company, and balancing financial performance as we do so. From a financial perspective, we performed well in fiscal 2017 across all metrics. On our last earnings conference call, we narrowed our fiscal year 2017 currency adjusted revenue growth to the high end of our previous range and raised our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range, despite headwinds from foreign currency and fully diluted share count. Fiscal year 2017 revenue excluding LifeLock was $4.063 billion, up 12% on a constant currency basis. Revenue was $4.163 billion including the stub period of revenue contribution from LifeLock. Organic revenue growth, excluding Blue Coat and LifeLock, was down just under 3% compared to our original fiscal year 2017 guidance of down 4% to down 1%, and our performance in fiscal year 2016, down 5%. On an organic basis, Consumer Security revenue was down 5%, within our original fiscal year 2017 guidance of down 3% to down 6%. On an organic basis, Enterprise Security revenue was down 1% compared to our original fiscal year 2017 guidance of down 2% to flat. Non-GAAP operating margin excluding LifeLock was 29%, consistent with our prior guidance. We completed the year with over $300 million of run rate cost savings and integration synergies, ahead of our plans. Including LifeLock, non-GAAP operating margin remained at 29%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.18, including a $0.01 headwind from LifeLock, which is an increase of 15% year over year and above our original guidance of $1.06 to $1.10 provided in May 2016. Cash flow from operations for the full year was negative $220 million but included $887 million in cash tax payments related to the sale of Veritas and $141 million of restructuring and separation payments. With respect to our cost savings initiatives and acquisition integration synergies, on prior calls, we discussed that our total cost savings initiatives are comprised of $400 million in net cost efficiencies on the Symantec business and $150 million in Blue Coat cost synergies to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2018. In addition, at acquisition announcement, we communicated $80 million of cost synergies for LifeLock by fiscal year 2020, $30 million of which we expect to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2018. As of the end of fiscal year 2017, we have achieved over $300 million of the $550 million in net cost efficiencies and Blue Coat synergies, which is faster than our original plan. We are also tracking well to achieve the LifeLock synergies of $30 million this year and $80 million by fiscal year 2020. Now turning to balance sheet and capital allocation, as of March 31, we had $4.3 billion in cash and short-term investments and $8.3 billion in gross debt including $1.75 billion of convertible notes. We expect to complete our $500 million accelerated share repurchase before the end of our fiscal first quarter and have $800 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization. Now let me provide you context on how we are entering fiscal year 2018. We have fundamentally transformed both our Enterprise and Consumer Security businesses and are now the largest pure-play cyber security company. Our Enterprise Security business is positioned with a robust and Integrated Cyber Defense Platform that increases the return on investment our customers realize from their security spend. The acquisition of LifeLock was a catalyst that enabled our Consumer business to expand into a new market category of Consumer Digital Safety. With respect to our financial outlook, I want to acknowledge that given the two acquisitions and all of the integration, transformation and business process changes we are executing, investors' financial models need to be updated. We are giving you as much information on this call as we can, and expect to use our Financial Analyst Day to further give you context on the drivers of the financials for each of our business segments and the overall corporation. Let me start with the full year, then provide our first quarter outlook. Further detail and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations and guidance are available in the CFO commentary. For the full year, we expect revenue to increase to $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion at guided rates, which is approximately 3% constant currency growth adjusted for acquisitions at the midpoint. We have incorporated in our guidance an expectation of a further shift to subscription in our Blue Coat network products versus fiscal year 2017, which reflects the recent increase in customers choosing our cloud offerings. This shift benefits future visibility to revenue and end year deferred revenue and cash flow. End year revenue from business moving to subscription will naturally be lower. We have also incorporated in our guidance our revenue expectations for our website security business due to the ongoing dispute with Google and the uncertainty it has created for customers. From a seasonality standpoint we expect the mix of our $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion of revenue to be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year, with about a 2 point shift from the first half, second half revenue mix we saw in the base Symantec business in fiscal year 2017. We believe this is reasonable, given the substantial transformation and business process changes we made in our Enterprise segment at the beginning of the fiscal year. In Consumer, we are launching our digital safety offerings, which are subscription offerings generated by our Norton and LifeLock teams. The combination of these actions in Enterprise and Consumer set us up extremely well to realize fully the value propositions of our transformative acquisitions. That said, the benefits to revenue will accrue later in the fiscal year, as all of the changes take root. For fiscal year 2018, we expect Enterprise Security growth adjusted for acquisitions of 3% to 5%, and Consumer Security growth adjusted for acquisitions of 1% to 3%. We expect that Consumer Security will show growth adjusted for acquisitions in the first half of the fiscal year. As Greg indicated, we expect the company to be exiting fiscal year 2018 at a revenue growth rate in the mid-single digits. We expect non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal year 2018 of 36% to 37%, up 8 to 9 points in constant currency versus fiscal year 2017. We exited fiscal year 2017 ahead of plan on our cost savings and synergy commitments, and expect to maintain our cadence in fiscal year 2018. We remain on track to exiting fiscal year 2018 with our cost savings and Blue Coat synergy programs largely complete. As it relates to the LifeLock synergies, we remain on plan to achieve the $30 million in synergies we committed to by the end of fiscal year 2018 and the $80 million by the end of fiscal year 2020. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.75 to $1.85 for fiscal year 2018, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $1.70 to $1.80, and up 52% to 61% versus fiscal year 2017 in constant currency. We expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 29.5%, up 50 basis points from fiscal year 2017 and driven by our mix of business. We expect fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 675 million, up from 645 million in fiscal year 2017 and driven by increased share price and its impact on our convertible notes and options. We have not built substantial share repurchases into our share count estimates as our focus, from a capital allocation perspective, is on debt reduction. We plan to pay down a portion of our debt outstanding in fiscal year 2018. We have repaid $810 million of pre-payable debt so far this quarter and expect to retire our $600 million bond due in June. We also continue to maintain our regular quarterly dividend. Before I turn to our first quarter outlook, I would like to discuss the progression of our fiscal 2018 outlook. In June 2016 when we laid out our fiscal year 2018 EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.80, the euro was trading at $1.13 and our underlying share count assumption was 585 million, which implied fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP net income of approximately $1 billion. Our fiscal year 2018 guidance today implies substantial non-GAAP net income improvement versus that initial estimate. At the same time, the euro has depreciated 5% causing an incremental $0.05 headwind to that guidance. Our share price has appreciated by approximately 70%, resulting in approximately 35 million shares of dilution from our convertible debt. The considerable share price appreciation also resulted in our share repurchase program retiring less shares than we had previously anticipated. And in addition, we reallocated a portion of the previously planned share repurchase for the LifeLock acquisition which we determined to be a better use of shareholder capital. Many of our existing long-term focused shareholders are well aware of these moving parts, but for those that are new to Symantec, we believe it is helpful to frame the changes over this timeframe and since this initial fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP EPS range was issued, to where we are today. Moving to our first quarter outlook, given the integration of our acquisitions, business process changes, and modification to sales coverage we put in place at the beginning of April, as well as the shift to more subscription business, we believe it is prudent to set measured first quarter guidance. We expect non-GAAP revenue for the first quarter to be up 37% to 40%, which at guided rates translates to $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect Enterprise revenues to increase 36% to 40% and Consumer revenue to increase 38% to 40%. We expect operating margins to be 27% to 29%, and expand sequentially each quarter from there. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 to $0.32 and an underlying share count of 667 million shares. We will share additional details on the outlook of each of our businesses at our Financial Analyst Day in June. So in summary, business activity and momentum with customers was strong as we exited fiscal year 2017. Financially, we saw stronger than expected subscription in our product mix, which impacted end period revenue, but was more than offset by our cost management, driving operating margins and earnings to the high end of our prior guidance. At the same time, our integration, transformation and business process work is going well and is setting us on firm footing to realize the value propositions we outlined to you related to the acquisitions in both our Enterprise and Consumer business segments. Our financial guidance for fiscal year 2018 reflects our work and the fundamental change taking place at Symantec. From a revenue perspective, we expect to see the benefits accrue later in the year, as all of the changes take root and yield results. With 8 to 9 points of operating margin growth, and 52% to 61% non-GAAP EPS growth in fiscal year 2018, we believe the company will be set on a strong trajectory of long term sustainable growth with leading profitability for the future. Thank you for your time and let me turn the call back over to Greg. Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Thank you, Nick. Jon, I'll ask you to lead the Q&A. Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp. Operator, please take our first question. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer and Company. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thank you. Good afternoon, Greg, Nick, Jon. I want to start by focusing on the endpoint side of the equation. Progress on EDR without a doubt seemed to be encouraging given some of the metrics and data you disclosed in your prepared remarks. Greg, can you talk to us about some of the market trends driving Endpoint Detection and Response? Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Yes, so I think the endpoint is a busy space at the moment, and one of the things that we're really into is delivering a converged endpoint to try to reduce some of the chaos and expense in our customers as we had described in one of the examples. And so we have I think closed the gap on any of the AI-based [stimulus] detection machine learning aspects of the endpoint and always had the best sort of detection technologies that we had. And recently, we had turned our energy onto the EDR front. EDR is a very important piece. It is really trying to get to the repair and response to malware events or cyber security events. We have entered the market last year with that and I think in our prepared remarks we talked about some substantial success in that first year and we really look forward to that converged solution coming into the release of our SEP 14 platform in the very near future. From a customer wallet point of view, there is a wallet open for EDR at the moment in the enterprise, and we do expect to take a good piece of that. And I think another big benefit for us is the effect of that capability in our product in our renewal and we do expect our renewal rates on endpoint to increase. We are also delivering other endpoint technology that is great. We have a future release coming up this year of endpoint integrated very tightly with our proxy technology that will change the game in being able to respond and detect problems. And we have a great cross sell opportunity for endpoint DLP, which is very powerful in the cloud generation for protecting enterprise data from the endpoint to the cloud. So you put all that together, we also think there is a great opportunity for us to take share as some of the big market share leaders have had some headwinds in third party analysis. And as mentioned, in our prepared remarks, it had reports come out that have sort of downgraded their capability. We expect to step into some of that share also. One of the other points I'd like to make about the remarks in our conference call is the traditional Symantec Enterprise Security business grew this quarter in Q4. And remember comments from the prior call where that was slightly negative and we had felt good about our opportunity to bring that back to growth. And that was delivered in Q4. Operator And our next question is from the line of Sarah Hindlian from Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Hi, thank you guys for taking my question. Greg, I wanted to start with you. Could you maybe expand a little bit on what you're seeing in terms of the subscription adoption in Blue Coat, and maybe obviously $100 million run rate is quite large so how is that impacting the product's revenue? And then a second question for you, Nick. We published on the Google SSL issue recently, and we attempted to pin down some impact it would have on your ability to raise EPS outlook, and then in your prepared comments you are calling this out as a factor in your raise of the fiscal year 2018 outlook. And I'm hoping you can help me also quantify if we're in the right ballpark in terms of the adverse impact we're assessing on that as well. Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Yeah, so I'll start off. I think with the Blue Coat question. So first we did see more subscription. I think there's a couple of things that are going on there. First of all, we have now achieved feature parity with the Blue Coat solution, whether it be the hardware appliance, the VAs that we deployed for software defined network solutions and also the pure cloud offering. So we want to provide our products to customers the way they want to buy them. And as we see more and more cloud adoption in the enterprise, we now offer our customers the three different versions of how to take that technology on. In the fourth quarter, we saw a more than what we had planned adoption of the cloud and subscription versions of those form factors. Very good result because that is proof that the Symantec technology is being designed into the future network architectures of some of our large enterprise customers. We think that there's going to be more of that in the future, and hence, we have on many conference calls, we have put an underscore on mix as we go forward and we do see, as the cloud generation takes off, more of that mix. We also have seen great traction with our Blue Coat subscription and Blue Coat cloud technology. That is something that is growing at a very strong clip. And as we reported in our remarks, that 67% growth rate at the sort of revenue zip code, we do expect a strong future there. So that hits the current period with tailwinds into the deferred revenue for the future. But we really also want to point out it's difficult to decipher the deferred revenue, and Nick can make comments on that later or at the Analyst Day. But I think it's really important to understand that we did see the expected levels of business in the Blue Coat products in Q4, and we saw a shift of some of the form factor with which it is purchased, which affected some of the end period revenue. Okay, so the business was in good shape. And we're happy with the outcome there. Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp. So, Sarah, it's Nick. Thanks for the question. So maybe first of all, let me just frame the general size of the business, around $350 million in that type of a range. A substantial amount of the business especially as we enter a year in, in Q1 will come off the balance sheet. So, obviously I wanted to size it, but as Greg indicated in his comments, we're having a set of conversations and discussions around our business, around the environment with Google and others. So we don't want to get into too much detail and granularity on that at this point in time because those are ongoing discussions, but we feel good about those that are happening. So, suffice it to say, I think it's important to understand the relative size of the business versus the rest of the portfolio. A substantial amount of the business comes off the balance sheet. So obviously that's a risk mitigator in terms of end quarter or quarterly revenue streams and contribution to EPS. But it's certainly something that we think about on the go forward. Operator And our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. This is Melissa Gorham calling in for Keith. I just wanted to put a finer point on the Q1 guide. So it seems like there's a number of factors that potentially could drive some conservatism. You talked about the certificate business, the shift towards subscription, but you also noted a more modest close rate assumption, just given the integration of the sales force. So I'm wondering if you could just maybe put a little bit of a finer point around those factors if you could help quantify it. And then in terms of the integration of the sales force, where are we in this process and will that kind of extend beyond Q1? Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Hey, Melissa. Thank you. Very good questions. So two things are happening and just put an underscore around the product mix that we described and also the ramp in sales. And we did talk in our prepared remarks about two things. We have put a substantial amount of work into the back office systems and what we have done in our demand chain and our channel. That has gone into effect coming out of Q4 and into the first quarter of this fiscal year. And we have spent a lot of time planning and preparing the sort of realignment of our sales force where we used to have that sales force overlap on a bunch of named accounts. We have now worked for the last nine months to align them to the market. And we are just signaling to folks that it will take a little bit of time for that newly-aligned field to get productive. Okay? And so those are two things. And I'll pass the call over – the question over to Nick to hit a couple of these as well. Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp. Yeah, Melissa, maybe just to put a point on the non-sales side for a second because Greg's obviously incredibly close to that. But I wanted to also highlight the amount of work that the enterprise team has been doing in the integration activities. And because we are touching every SKU, every disty, every channel partner, all the price lists. The team's been training the sales force since October/November timeframe. There's been a significant – and then the system side of the fence where the team here has really broken through multiple years of stuff that hasn't been integrated to make it integrated. So a lot of work has been done. We look at that as a real positive in terms of the future, in terms of traction, in terms of visibility to our business and all of those pieces. Obviously that all landed at the beginning of the quarter, and we want to be conscious of that. And want to be measured when we think about how fast an individual can pick up all this new stuff and be at 100% capacity with it. Everything feels good, and I think the team is very, very excited about all that change. But just want to be conscious of it, when we pull together the financial side of the fence for Q1. And obviously I indicated in the scripted commentary, also our thoughts around where the revenue falls this year, and it's a different mix in terms of the proportions in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. That is obviously a discussion of what's going on, on the enterprise side here, and the ramp up that we expect to have, as well as the synergies on the consumer side with the bundles on LifeLock. Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. I think that's a good point. Okay, the bundles are important. We mentioned that we are the only vendor in the market in our prepared remarks with the four major pieces of CloudStack, and others really taking what used to be four separate sort of pieces of technology and putting them together. That's an example of a bundle. And when we put it together, how that gets purchased and recognized is different than it may be historically. And I think the other piece that's really, really important is we did do the hard work for those of you who are long-term, we did go after the massive number of different kinds of distribution contracts. Thousands and thousands of SKUs, and reduced those things to a modern demand chain, modern set of distribution contracts and a much, much simplified price book for our products, and so we are going after long-term complexity take-down. And the other piece, I think, that definitely makes me feel good about things is our sales attrition is extremely low. And we come out of a fiscal year with just everybody hit all their – the usual cohort of very good folks did well, and now coming into this year, you usually get a spike in attrition. We did not have that. Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp. Okay, next question. Operator And our next question is from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC Yeah, thanks guys. Greg, Enterprise Security, I believe grew 2% organically this quarter. I was wondering if you can provide a bit more granularity on actually how much of ES is growing versus declining. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, Blue Coat obviously enters a large refresh shortly, can you provide a little bit more color on the magnitude of the refresh, and maybe how you think about incorporating that into your full-year guide? Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. So, now let me start off by passing over the growth by product question to Nick, and he can knock some of that down, and I'll come back to the last one. Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp. And Matt, you're kind of getting into some stuff that we're looking forward to showing at Financial Analyst Day. So let me just give you some high level statistics. What we're looking at, and the teams, again, on the enterprise side has done a really good job here looking at the products and where we are on the products. And frankly we can group growers and great growers and others, and when we do those types of things, we've got a substantial element of the product on the ES side that are growing already in the mid to high single digits. And that incorporates some of the elements obviously from Blue Coat, from endpoint, et cetera, which we'll show you at the Financial Analyst Day. That is also reflecting only the front end of what we think we can do in terms of the combinations of products and products working together that Greg spoke to. We also indicated that looking at products is going to be difficult go forward as we bundle, but we want to try to give you some of that perspective the best we can. And I'll point you to Financial Analyst Day for some of that material. We also acknowledge that there's elements of the portfolio that are shrinking, right? And that's a small proportion of the whole. When we break it into those types of proportions, we feel that that shrink is going to moderate over the course of the year as some of these things just become less and less important. But we do expect to show you that kind of what set of products are in what camp, if you will, to give you a perspective of what we're working with, and then how that looks going forward, and how we're going to be combining things go forward. But as I indicated in the scripted remarks, I think that us talking about specific products and numbers for specific products in any one quarter, we're going to be doing a lot less of. Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Yeah. And Matt, moving to your next question about the Blue Coat refresh, I think there's – we have I would say a very good reputation in the market with respect to the products and technologies that Blue Coat delivered to our customers, and that refresh is coming from having looked at Blue Coat before. What you have is a high end of enterprise and middle enterprise solution that's very popular in that cohort. And so that cohort is migrating to the cloud and really landing in what we call a hybrid cloud situation, where they definitely have need store on premise, hardware in some environments and other stuff they'd like to pick up just purely from the cloud. And for those who have built the virtual infrastructure like the virtualization capabilities, they want to be able to pick this stuff up in a software defined space. So as we roll into the refresh, which really happens in FY 2018, and then throughout FY 2019 in healthy numbers, nothing's happened to the size of it. We do see like we saw in Q4, we expect to see a better natural mix shift to the software defined and pure cloud choices for that, which we think are very good. If you look at a competitive displacement of that, we think we have a better stack for that technology than any other vendor, and we can give it to you how you want to buy it. And that's how we're approaching the refresh is if you want it in cloud, you want it in software defined, you want it in appliances, you tell us, we give it to you. And we think that when you look at the feature set of that set of capabilities, it is extremely differentiated. It is better than anything else on the market. So we are still planning on that going well, and that also is in our thoughts around a strong second half and also a very strong 2019. Okay? Operator And our next question is from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co. All right, thanks for taking the question. I apologize for the background noise here, but first question on the endpoint, maybe just a follow-up. Can you just give us any more color on the endpoint integration with ProxySG that you had mentioned and how that plays into the conversation with customers? And then second, can you just give also an update on your discussions with cable MSOs, or any other home router providers and how they need to pull your Norton software on top of their hardware in addition to the Norton Core offering that you're about to launch. Thanks. Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Yeah, no problem. So let me take on the Norton Core one first, and then I'll circle back to the private. So in the Norton Core discussion, we have seen from the pre-launch of the product at the CES Show around the start of January, we've seen a continuing build in substantial interest both from kind of end customers as well as cable, broadband, telecom operators and other folks that have been traditional channels for more malware oriented technology. So we think that the future is bright for Core, and we've had some very, very good business interactions with some of those providers. We don't have – we don't want to mess up any of our announcements that may happen in the future by talking about that on this call, but I would say that we still are very optimistic about Core. And because of the value proposition, and I think the growing awareness of the plethora of internet enabled devices in the home and being able to take care of that. So we like the business activity around Core, and we think as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the growth driver from that is definitely a reason for optimism. For the first part of your question is really about endpoint and Proxy. And I think that we've delivered. One thing that we talked about on the call, which is very powerful, which is the threat telemetry into our AI that comes from the integration of endpoint and our Proxy technology. And what that means is if we know about something in the web that's bad, the endpoints are aware of that and they won't even initiate those kind of connections when the user is requesting those or when malware is trying to go to those. Also, modern malware comes to you in lots of pieces. It can be taking a long time with different forms of getting there. When we detect that and we go and stitch that back together, we can vaccinate all of those avenues in the network, and thus shut down those infections, and so we really like what's happening right now in our telemetry and the AI associated with it. When we first launched it, we talked about blocking 300-and-some-thousand events per day, and that's gotten smarter over time. And is now into the 3-plus million per day. And so that is extremely encouraging. What's happening next in conjunction with what we're doing in EDR is being able to have our network technology reach back to the client when they see something that they don't understand or something that's new or something that's anomalistic, and ask what's on the other end of this? What is requesting this? What is this? And when we see kind of a Twitter tweet that didn't come from a Twitter app or a browser, we would get very interested in that, and that EDR meets ProxySG. And our security analytics technology delivers a solution that we think will seriously differentiate us in the market. We know a lot about it and we're working hard towards that goal. Additionally, we have some more work we're doing with our client multi-factor authenticator to also enlist our users when we something that's anomalistic, and actually ask them, hey, we noticed this. Are you actually copying all these files right now? And we get a yes or no out of that, and that can really also enlist a very different set of remediation and detection capability. So we are driving innovation in network meets endpoint in a huge way and we are – our engineers are super excited about what's going on. And they run into my office quite often to show me something cool, and I think we're going to excite people as we start to release those pieces of technology where the rest of our network technology meets endpoint. Operator And our next... Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp. Next question. I think we have time for one more. Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Yeah, go ahead. Operator Indeed. Our next question is from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here. Two questions if I may, first maybe for Greg. Greg, can you just talk about EDR pricing and how that might change just on a unit basis for a customer on SEP 14 adding EDR? And then the second question maybe for you, Nick, on the consumer side, a lot of talk about the LifeLock and Norton bundles. How impactful could that bundle be on your 2018 revenue guide? Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Okay. So on the pricing side of EDR, I think the market is definitely used to buying EDR right now. So there's definitely a wallet and a budget open for that. And we do expect to, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, to be able to go in and say where that becomes a Symantec Integrated Cyber Defense Platform solution, we want to be able to give our customers a lower cost of ownership for that integrated product. And so, we expect to take down – we expect that we have an opportunity to, in that share of wallet, to get more for Symantec, but also give back a good chunk to our partners and our customer base. So we do think that we are a huge disruptor to the current state of play in EDR, because we do have a massive installed base. And in our business case, we also like to incent that renewal, which is very helpful for us because we do grow from two good pieces of security real estate, that and the endpoint, that and the network, and that and the big threat analytics. So we like growing and retaining our share at the endpoint. EDR will be a driver for that. I think the other piece that's quite good, we mentioned a very large case where we won an EDR account in our prepared remarks against all of the who's who. We also entered the market just in FY 2017 with EDR, and we did get a very strong set of installs around that that were competitive. So you mentioned the pricing. I think that's still kind of TBD from a list MSRP kind of situation when coupled with the next version of SEP 14. We do expect that to be more for Symantec, less for our customer. Okay? Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp. And then maybe just a couple of points on the Norton side of the fence or I should say on the consumer side of the fence with digital safety strategy. So first of all, I think – let me come up for a second and really acknowledge what's happened over the past year. I think the results and the top line results have continued to get better, and we've been better than, and the team has driven better than expected results each quarter. With LifeLock, the actual – the GAAP results are basically flat year-on-year, and I think nobody would have expected that. Obviously I realize there's a stub period in there for LifeLock, but as we project forward into FY 2018, we have a consumer organization that is growing and is growing organically. And I think that's really important based upon a couple of things. Some of them, we're seeing already, such as the renewal metrics, the mobile solutions, the privacy technology. And some of them are on the LifeLock side of the fence in the bundles between Norton and LifeLock. And we continue to be very, very positive on that interlink. There is – the last piece I'd say is between the two, we have a substantial demand gen budget. And we are utilizing that. We are doing all of the pieces in terms of building and getting those bundles ready. Greg mentioned some timing on some of that stuff in his prepared remarks. I'm going to point you to Financial Analyst Day again because I know that Fran will be spending much more time talking about it then as well. So we are very positive on it. I think what I don't want to do is have you think that it's only the bundles that are driving the betterment in consumer. It's the work that's going on in just blocking and tackling of the basics of renewals, on new products as well. But we feel very, very good about the prospects for consumer and for organic growth in FY 2018. Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. We're forecasting organic growth in FY 2018 for consumer, and there's a lot of room for positive thoughts about how that's going to go. Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. So, I think that's it. We're out of time, overtime. And I'd just like to thank all of you for getting on the call and asking some great questions. And at this point, in the transformation of Symantec, I think we have achieved some outstanding results on the operational efficiencies and the margin optimization. And I think we are set up on an outcome for FY 2018 that we feel as management team is achievable. And we feel great about what happens coming out of FY 2018 into FY 2019, and that is something that we really look forward to the discussion at Financial Analyst Day. We'll put the coffee pot on early. It's going to be a lot of detail. There's a lot to discuss. And look forward to seeing you all in person I think in just a little less than a month on June 8. So thank you very much for your time today. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's fourth quarter earnings call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Our first question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer and Company. Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thank you. Good afternoon, Greg, Nick, Jon. I want to start by focusing on the endpoint side of the equation. Progress on EDR without a doubt seemed to be encouraging given some of the metrics and data you disclosed in your prepared remarks. Greg, can you talk to us about some of the market trends driving Endpoint Detection and Response? Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Yes, so I think the endpoint is a busy space at the moment, and one of the things that we're really into is delivering a converged endpoint to try to reduce some of the chaos and expense in our customers as we had described in one of the examples. And so we have I think closed the gap on any of the AI-based [stimulus] detection machine learning aspects of the endpoint and always had the best sort of detection technologies that we had. And recently, we had turned our energy onto the EDR front. EDR is a very important piece. It is really trying to get to the repair and response to malware events or cyber security events. We have entered the market last year with that and I think in our prepared remarks we talked about some substantial success in that first year and we really look forward to that converged solution coming into the release of our SEP 14 platform in the very near future. From a customer wallet point of view, there is a wallet open for EDR at the moment in the enterprise, and we do expect to take a good piece of that. And I think another big benefit for us is the effect of that capability in our product in our renewal and we do expect our renewal rates on endpoint to increase. We are also delivering other endpoint technology that is great. We have a future release coming up this year of endpoint integrated very tightly with our proxy technology that will change the game in being able to respond and detect problems. And we have a great cross sell opportunity for endpoint DLP, which is very powerful in the cloud generation for protecting enterprise data from the endpoint to the cloud. So you put all that together, we also think there is a great opportunity for us to take share as some of the big market share leaders have had some headwinds in third party analysis. And as mentioned, in our prepared remarks, it had reports come out that have sort of downgraded their capability. We expect to step into some of that share also. One of the other points I'd like to make about the remarks in our conference call is the traditional Symantec Enterprise Security business grew this quarter in Q4. And remember comments from the prior call where that was slightly negative and we had felt good about our opportunity to bring that back to growth. And that was delivered in Q4. Operator And our next question is from the line of Sarah Hindlian from Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Hi, thank you guys for taking my question. Greg, I wanted to start with you. Could you maybe expand a little bit on what you're seeing in terms of the subscription adoption in Blue Coat, and maybe obviously $100 million run rate is quite large so how is that impacting the product's revenue? And then a second question for you, Nick. We published on the Google SSL issue recently, and we attempted to pin down some impact it would have on your ability to raise EPS outlook, and then in your prepared comments you are calling this out as a factor in your raise of the fiscal year 2018 outlook. And I'm hoping you can help me also quantify if we're in the right ballpark in terms of the adverse impact we're assessing on that as well. Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Yeah, so I'll start off. I think with the Blue Coat question. So first we did see more subscription. I think there's a couple of things that are going on there. First of all, we have now achieved feature parity with the Blue Coat solution, whether it be the hardware appliance, the VAs that we deployed for software defined network solutions and also the pure cloud offering. So we want to provide our products to customers the way they want to buy them. And as we see more and more cloud adoption in the enterprise, we now offer our customers the three different versions of how to take that technology on. In the fourth quarter, we saw a more than what we had planned adoption of the cloud and subscription versions of those form factors. Very good result because that is proof that the Symantec technology is being designed into the future network architectures of some of our large enterprise customers. We think that there's going to be more of that in the future, and hence, we have on many conference calls, we have put an underscore on mix as we go forward and we do see, as the cloud generation takes off, more of that mix. We also have seen great traction with our Blue Coat subscription and Blue Coat cloud technology. That is something that is growing at a very strong clip. And as we reported in our remarks, that 67% growth rate at the sort of revenue zip code, we do expect a strong future there. So that hits the current period with tailwinds into the deferred revenue for the future. But we really also want to point out it's difficult to decipher the deferred revenue, and Nick can make comments on that later or at the Analyst Day. But I think it's really important to understand that we did see the expected levels of business in the Blue Coat products in Q4, and we saw a shift of some of the form factor with which it is purchased, which affected some of the end period revenue. Okay, so the business was in good shape. And we're happy with the outcome there. Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp. So, Sarah, it's Nick. Thanks for the question. So maybe first of all, let me just frame the general size of the business, around $350 million in that type of a range. A substantial amount of the business especially as we enter a year in, in Q1 will come off the balance sheet. So, obviously I wanted to size it, but as Greg indicated in his comments, we're having a set of conversations and discussions around our business, around the environment with Google and others. So we don't want to get into too much detail and granularity on that at this point in time because those are ongoing discussions, but we feel good about those that are happening. So, suffice it to say, I think it's important to understand the relative size of the business versus the rest of the portfolio. A substantial amount of the business comes off the balance sheet. So obviously that's a risk mitigator in terms of end quarter or quarterly revenue streams and contribution to EPS. But it's certainly something that we think about on the go forward. Operator And our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. This is Melissa Gorham calling in for Keith. I just wanted to put a finer point on the Q1 guide. So it seems like there's a number of factors that potentially could drive some conservatism. You talked about the certificate business, the shift towards subscription, but you also noted a more modest close rate assumption, just given the integration of the sales force. So I'm wondering if you could just maybe put a little bit of a finer point around those factors if you could help quantify it. And then in terms of the integration of the sales force, where are we in this process and will that kind of extend beyond Q1? Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Hey, Melissa. Thank you. Very good questions. So two things are happening and just put an underscore around the product mix that we described and also the ramp in sales. And we did talk in our prepared remarks about two things. We have put a substantial amount of work into the back office systems and what we have done in our demand chain and our channel. That has gone into effect coming out of Q4 and into the first quarter of this fiscal year. And we have spent a lot of time planning and preparing the sort of realignment of our sales force where we used to have that sales force overlap on a bunch of named accounts. We have now worked for the last nine months to align them to the market. And we are just signaling to folks that it will take a little bit of time for that newly-aligned field to get productive. Okay? And so those are two things. And I'll pass the call over – the question over to Nick to hit a couple of these as well. Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp. Yeah, Melissa, maybe just to put a point on the non-sales side for a second because Greg's obviously incredibly close to that. But I wanted to also highlight the amount of work that the enterprise team has been doing in the integration activities. And because we are touching every SKU, every disty, every channel partner, all the price lists. The team's been training the sales force since October/November timeframe. There's been a significant – and then the system side of the fence where the team here has really broken through multiple years of stuff that hasn't been integrated to make it integrated. So a lot of work has been done. We look at that as a real positive in terms of the future, in terms of traction, in terms of visibility to our business and all of those pieces. Obviously that all landed at the beginning of the quarter, and we want to be conscious of that. And want to be measured when we think about how fast an individual can pick up all this new stuff and be at 100% capacity with it. Everything feels good, and I think the team is very, very excited about all that change. But just want to be conscious of it, when we pull together the financial side of the fence for Q1. And obviously I indicated in the scripted commentary, also our thoughts around where the revenue falls this year, and it's a different mix in terms of the proportions in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. That is obviously a discussion of what's going on, on the enterprise side here, and the ramp up that we expect to have, as well as the synergies on the consumer side with the bundles on LifeLock. Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. I think that's a good point. Okay, the bundles are important. We mentioned that we are the only vendor in the market in our prepared remarks with the four major pieces of CloudStack, and others really taking what used to be four separate sort of pieces of technology and putting them together. That's an example of a bundle. And when we put it together, how that gets purchased and recognized is different than it may be historically. And I think the other piece that's really, really important is we did do the hard work for those of you who are long-term, we did go after the massive number of different kinds of distribution contracts. Thousands and thousands of SKUs, and reduced those things to a modern demand chain, modern set of distribution contracts and a much, much simplified price book for our products, and so we are going after long-term complexity take-down. And the other piece, I think, that definitely makes me feel good about things is our sales attrition is extremely low. And we come out of a fiscal year with just everybody hit all their – the usual cohort of very good folks did well, and now coming into this year, you usually get a spike in attrition. We did not have that. Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp. Okay, next question. Operator And our next question is from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC Yeah, thanks guys. Greg, Enterprise Security, I believe grew 2% organically this quarter. I was wondering if you can provide a bit more granularity on actually how much of ES is growing versus declining. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, Blue Coat obviously enters a large refresh shortly, can you provide a little bit more color on the magnitude of the refresh, and maybe how you think about incorporating that into your full-year guide? Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. So, now let me start off by passing over the growth by product question to Nick, and he can knock some of that down, and I'll come back to the last one. Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp. And Matt, you're kind of getting into some stuff that we're looking forward to showing at Financial Analyst Day. So let me just give you some high level statistics. What we're looking at, and the teams, again, on the enterprise side has done a really good job here looking at the products and where we are on the products. And frankly we can group growers and great growers and others, and when we do those types of things, we've got a substantial element of the product on the ES side that are growing already in the mid to high single digits. And that incorporates some of the elements obviously from Blue Coat, from endpoint, et cetera, which we'll show you at the Financial Analyst Day. That is also reflecting only the front end of what we think we can do in terms of the combinations of products and products working together that Greg spoke to. We also indicated that looking at products is going to be difficult go forward as we bundle, but we want to try to give you some of that perspective the best we can. And I'll point you to Financial Analyst Day for some of that material. We also acknowledge that there's elements of the portfolio that are shrinking, right? And that's a small proportion of the whole. When we break it into those types of proportions, we feel that that shrink is going to moderate over the course of the year as some of these things just become less and less important. But we do expect to show you that kind of what set of products are in what camp, if you will, to give you a perspective of what we're working with, and then how that looks going forward, and how we're going to be combining things go forward. But as I indicated in the scripted remarks, I think that us talking about specific products and numbers for specific products in any one quarter, we're going to be doing a lot less of. Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Yeah. And Matt, moving to your next question about the Blue Coat refresh, I think there's – we have I would say a very good reputation in the market with respect to the products and technologies that Blue Coat delivered to our customers, and that refresh is coming from having looked at Blue Coat before. What you have is a high end of enterprise and middle enterprise solution that's very popular in that cohort. And so that cohort is migrating to the cloud and really landing in what we call a hybrid cloud situation, where they definitely have need store on premise, hardware in some environments and other stuff they'd like to pick up just purely from the cloud. And for those who have built the virtual infrastructure like the virtualization capabilities, they want to be able to pick this stuff up in a software defined space. So as we roll into the refresh, which really happens in FY 2018, and then throughout FY 2019 in healthy numbers, nothing's happened to the size of it. We do see like we saw in Q4, we expect to see a better natural mix shift to the software defined and pure cloud choices for that, which we think are very good. If you look at a competitive displacement of that, we think we have a better stack for that technology than any other vendor, and we can give it to you how you want to buy it. And that's how we're approaching the refresh is if you want it in cloud, you want it in software defined, you want it in appliances, you tell us, we give it to you. And we think that when you look at the feature set of that set of capabilities, it is extremely differentiated. It is better than anything else on the market. So we are still planning on that going well, and that also is in our thoughts around a strong second half and also a very strong 2019. Okay? Operator And our next question is from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co. All right, thanks for taking the question. I apologize for the background noise here, but first question on the endpoint, maybe just a follow-up. Can you just give us any more color on the endpoint integration with ProxySG that you had mentioned and how that plays into the conversation with customers? And then second, can you just give also an update on your discussions with cable MSOs, or any other home router providers and how they need to pull your Norton software on top of their hardware in addition to the Norton Core offering that you're about to launch. Thanks. Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Yeah, no problem. So let me take on the Norton Core one first, and then I'll circle back to the private. So in the Norton Core discussion, we have seen from the pre-launch of the product at the CES Show around the start of January, we've seen a continuing build in substantial interest both from kind of end customers as well as cable, broadband, telecom operators and other folks that have been traditional channels for more malware oriented technology. So we think that the future is bright for Core, and we've had some very, very good business interactions with some of those providers. We don't have – we don't want to mess up any of our announcements that may happen in the future by talking about that on this call, but I would say that we still are very optimistic about Core. And because of the value proposition, and I think the growing awareness of the plethora of internet enabled devices in the home and being able to take care of that. So we like the business activity around Core, and we think as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the growth driver from that is definitely a reason for optimism. For the first part of your question is really about endpoint and Proxy. And I think that we've delivered. One thing that we talked about on the call, which is very powerful, which is the threat telemetry into our AI that comes from the integration of endpoint and our Proxy technology. And what that means is if we know about something in the web that's bad, the endpoints are aware of that and they won't even initiate those kind of connections when the user is requesting those or when malware is trying to go to those. Also, modern malware comes to you in lots of pieces. It can be taking a long time with different forms of getting there. When we detect that and we go and stitch that back together, we can vaccinate all of those avenues in the network, and thus shut down those infections, and so we really like what's happening right now in our telemetry and the AI associated with it. When we first launched it, we talked about blocking 300-and-some-thousand events per day, and that's gotten smarter over time. And is now into the 3-plus million per day. And so that is extremely encouraging. What's happening next in conjunction with what we're doing in EDR is being able to have our network technology reach back to the client when they see something that they don't understand or something that's new or something that's anomalistic, and ask what's on the other end of this? What is requesting this? What is this? And when we see kind of a Twitter tweet that didn't come from a Twitter app or a browser, we would get very interested in that, and that EDR meets ProxySG. And our security analytics technology delivers a solution that we think will seriously differentiate us in the market. We know a lot about it and we're working hard towards that goal. Additionally, we have some more work we're doing with our client multi-factor authenticator to also enlist our users when we something that's anomalistic, and actually ask them, hey, we noticed this. Are you actually copying all these files right now? And we get a yes or no out of that, and that can really also enlist a very different set of remediation and detection capability. So we are driving innovation in network meets endpoint in a huge way and we are – our engineers are super excited about what's going on. And they run into my office quite often to show me something cool, and I think we're going to excite people as we start to release those pieces of technology where the rest of our network technology meets endpoint. Operator And our next... Jonathan Doros - Symantec Corp. Next question. I think we have time for one more. Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Yeah, go ahead. Operator Indeed. Our next question is from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here. Two questions if I may, first maybe for Greg. Greg, can you just talk about EDR pricing and how that might change just on a unit basis for a customer on SEP 14 adding EDR? And then the second question maybe for you, Nick, on the consumer side, a lot of talk about the LifeLock and Norton bundles. How impactful could that bundle be on your 2018 revenue guide? Gregory S. Clark - Symantec Corp. Okay. So on the pricing side of EDR, I think the market is definitely used to buying EDR right now. So there's definitely a wallet and a budget open for that.

I think the other piece that's quite good, we mentioned a very large case where we won an EDR account in our prepared remarks against all of the who's who.

I think that's still kind of TBD from a list MSRP kind of situation when coupled with the next version of SEP 14. We do expect that to be more for Symantec, less for our customer. Okay? Nicholas R. Noviello - Symantec Corp. And then maybe just a couple of points on the Norton side of the fence or I should say on the consumer side of the fence with digital safety strategy. So first of all, I think – let me come up for a second and really acknowledge what's happened over the past year. I think the results and the top line results have continued to get better, and we've been better than, and the team has driven better than expected results each quarter.

Thank you for standing by and welcome to the first quarter 2017 results call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I must advise you this conference is being recorded today on Thursday, the 11th of May, 2017. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Mannix, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Mannix Thank you, Vivian, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today to discuss Teva’s first quarter 2017 financial results. On the call with us today are Dr. Sol Barer, Chairman of the Board, Dr. Yitzhak Peterburg, Interim President and CEO; Eyal Desheh, Chief Financial Officer; Dipankar Bhattacharjee, Global Generic Medicines; Dr. Rob Koremans, Global Specialty Medicines; Dr. Michael Hayden, Global R&D, Chief Scientific Officer; Hafrun Fridriksdottir, Global Generics R&D; Dr. Carlo de Notaristefani, Global Operations; and David Stark, Chief Legal Officer. We’ll start the call with opening remarks from Sol and Dr. Peterburg, followed by a presentation from Eyal. We’ll then open the call up for questions-and-answers. A copy of the slides can be found on our website at www.tevapharm.com, as well as on our Teva Investor Relations app. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These estimates reflect management’s current expectations for Teva’s performance. Actual results may vary whether as a result of exchange rate differences, market conditions or other factors. In addition, the non-GAAP figures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets, costs related to certain regulatory actions, inventory step-up, legal settlements and reserves, impairments and related tax effects. The non-GAAP data presented by Teva are used by Teva’s management and board of directors to evaluate the operational performance of the company, to compare against the company’s work plans and budgets, and ultimately, to evaluate the performance of management. Teva provides such non-GAAP data to investors as a supplement of data and not in substitution or replacement for GAAP results, because management believes such data provides useful information to investors. And with that, I will now turn the call over to our Chairman. Sol, if you would please? Sol Barer Thank you, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us today.  Before we get into the details of our first quarter 2017 results, I want to take a few minutes to discuss the board's ongoing search to identify a permanent CEO. As I've indicated previously, this is my highest priority. We are looking for a world-class individual with deep and broad pharmaceutical experience, an individual with experience dealing with global and complex companies with a strong sense of corporate responsibility and proven strategic and operational capabilities. The process is moving along very well. We have interviewed a number of excellent candidates from all over the world. We are extremely encouraged by the talent and the overall quality of the pharmaceutical executives we are meeting with. The board will continue to take the time it needs to find the best candidate, but I am pleased with the progress we have made and the speed at which we are moving. While the CEO search process continues, the work of Teva to stabilize the business and deliver for shareholders has been significant. I said it last quarter and I will say it again, as Interim CEO, Yitzhak has the full support of the board to drive forward on Teva's strategies and key priorities. Execution remains the focus. The industry is facing turbulent times, and there remain challenges in the business. But I am confident that while the board and I focus on finding the right individual to lead Teva forward, we are taking the actions we need to take today to put the company on the right footing to continue to succeed in the future. Teva is doing everything in its power to deliver on its promise to shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Yitzhak. Yitzhak Peterburg Thank you, Sol. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.  Since I took over three months ago, my focus together with the management team and with the support of the board has been to execute on our previously discussed priorities for the year, which are: extracting synergies related to the Actavis Generics transaction; driving additional efficiencies throughout the organization; supporting cash generation and paying down our debt; and delivering on our promises of the specialty pipeline and key generic launches. First let me take you through a quick review of our quarterly results. Q1 started off 2017 generally as expected and as we guided, with it being the lowest quarter of a back-end loaded year. Revenues this quarter amounted to $5.6 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP net income of $1.1 billion and a non-GAAP EPS of $1.06. However, cash flow from operations was relatively soft, amounting to $500 million, negatively impacted by multiple one-time payments that were previously disclosed, including a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. Compared to Q4 2016, which marked the first full quarter consolidation of Actavis into our overall group results, revenues declined 30%, primarily due to: impacts resulting from a devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, which totaled $400 million; losses of exclusivity in the specialty segment during Q1; and divestment in the UK related to the Actavis Generics acquisition. We were able to mitigate approximately half of the decrease in the operating profit through a reduction in operating expenses. Now let me elaborate on some of the progress and challenges we experienced with our key priorities. As it relates to our first priority, I'm pleased to report the synergies related to the Actavis Generics acquisition and additional cost reduction which the company has identified is now on track to realize cumulative net synergies and cost reduction of approximately $1.5 billion by the end of 2017. This is compared to our spend base in the full year of 2016 combined company pro forma. This is almost $200 million more than what we guided to in January and is the result of an extensive review. Our second priority was to extract additional efficiencies in our organization. This was achieved during the quarter through various cost-saving measures, including initiation of site closures in R&D, restructuring in our global operation, and additional initiatives primarily consisting of headcount reduction and expense cuts. In most instances, we have witnessed an acceleration of planned cost saving. Since the close of the Actavis Generics transaction, we have reduced our headcount by approximately 5,000 people and expect further reductions through the end of 2017. Moving to our third priority of supporting cash generation and pay down $5 billion of debt in 2017, we are pleased that we reduced our gross debt by $1.2 billion, from $35.8 billion at year-end 2016 to $34.6 billion at the end of the first quarter. As discussed at a high level in January, part of the funds that we assume will help pay down the $5 billion are expected to come from divestiture proceeds.  Since taking over in February, I've worked extensively with the board and management team to identify the relevant non-core assets to be divested. Teva has elected to pursue the sale of its global Women’s Health business, and we have engaged Morgan Stanley to serve as our financial advisor. In addition, we have elected to sell our Oncology and Pain business in Europe, where Bank of America will serve as our financial advisor. We expect the sale process for both businesses to commence in the coming weeks with the distribution of marketing materials to interested buyers. We believe we will be able to complete this transaction by the end of the year subject to evaluation of pricing proposals and board approvals. We believe that the proceeds from the sale of both businesses as well as additional asset sales will be significantly in excess of our previously identified target of $1 billion. Our first priority, delivering on the promise of the specialty pipeline and key generic launches, during the quarter we received eight approvals in our specialty business, including AirDuo RespiClick and ArmonAir RespiClick in the U.S. and five in our growth markets.  Furthermore, AUSTEDO, or SD-809 for Huntington’s disease, was approved in the U.S. on April 3 and was launched less than two weeks later, with revenues expected beginning in July. It is still very early in the launch, but the initial data we have from a small data set is encouraging. AUSTEDO for tardive dyskinesia was granted Priority Review by the FDA and provided a PDUFA date of August 30. Assuming we are successful in obtaining final approval, that would put us in a position for launch in September. We are also quickly approaching a very important readout for our anti-CGRP, fremanezumab, with pivotal Phase 3 results for both chronic and episodic migraine expected for next month. As we all know, there are always risks when it comes to R&D, and we were reminded of that just a week ago when we announced that the CONCERTO trial of laquinimod in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis did not meet its primary endpoint. While we are disappointed for MS patients around the world, we have no further plans to pursue laquinimod in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Turning to generics, it has been two full quarters since the completion of our acquisition of Actavis Generics. The acquisition has provided us with many benefits, especially much stronger and broader R&D capabilities, which we believe are the engine for any successful generic business. This is essential in today’s world when we are operating across such an evolving competitive landscape and ongoing consolidation across our customer base. We are very confident that the global business we have built will allow Teva to thrive in the long-term future as a leader in the generic industry. Our generic business is not immune to the challenges other companies in our industry are currently facing with increased competition and consolidation. This is reflected in the most recent analysis we completed that looks at net price erosion in our U.S.-based business, which came in at 7% versus the approximately 5% that we communicated previously. The two biggest contributing factors to this change are the ongoing consolidation of our key customers, and the increase in generic drug approval by the FDA, which has created additional competition. The situation in Venezuela continues to deteriorate, which has led to greater instability that could negatively impact our business in the country, including our ability to produce products. This could have an impact on our projections, which include approximately $0.11 of earnings generated by Venezuela over the last three quarters of 2017. In 2016, we adjusted the exchange rate twice and in February 2017, we further updated the exchange rate to its current rate of 380 bolivars per dollar. Just to put it in perspective, in Q1 2017, revenues of generic and OTC medicine in Venezuela amounted to $21 million, compared to $238 million in Q1 2016 and more than $435 million in Q4 2016. As we stated in our press release of this morning, we are reaffirming our 2017 outlook. We are committing to [indiscernible], and therefore we wanted to provide more clarity into our business and the moving parts of our projections, specifically regarding the challenges in the U.S. Generics market and Venezuela. We will continue to keep you informed throughout the year as our team works extremely hard to execute on all of our promises and priorities for 2017. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words about Eyal Desheh, our CFO, whose planned departure we announced a few weeks ago. Eyal has contributed significantly to Teva growth and success throughout his tenure.  I am pleased to announce that Michael McClellan will serve as an Interim CFO effective July 1. Prior to joining Teva, Mike was the U.S. CFO at Sanofi, where his career spanned over 20 years in roles of increasing responsibility in global finance and healthcare. For the last two years, Mike has served as a CFO of our Global Specialty Medicines division. I’m confident he will be an excellent addition to our team. Eyal and Mike will work closely together to ensure a smooth transition. As we have stated previously, we expect our new CEO to have a significant role in identifying a permanent successor. Thank you, and I now turn the call over to Eyal to provide more insight into the numbers. Eyal Desheh Thank you very much, Yitzhak. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone.  Before I dive into the Q1 numbers, let me say a few personal words. As you read in our press release this morning and heard from Yitzhak just now, I will retire from my CFO role in Teva on June 30 this year. So, this is the last quarter I report as the CFO of this amazing company. I shared my views with all of you for 37 quarters in a row, and I hope that I’ve served you well, enabling all of you to better understand Teva and its developing business model. I worked with Teva for over 16 years in two periods, I worked with outstanding people and together we faced challenges and successes. I’m ready and looking forward to the next chapter in my professional career, which will commence soon, and there is no question that I will miss Teva, the excitement, and I will miss the interaction with all of you. I’m sure that I will cross path with many of you going forward. With Mike taking over as Interim CFO, I’m convinced that Teva finance is in very good hands. Mike is an experienced finance executive and will be a great leader to the excellent finance team we have in Teva and we’ll do that during this transition period. So, good luck to you, Mike. Now let’s take a few minutes to review the results of the first quarter of 2017. As always, I will take you through both GAAP and non-GAAP results. Our highlights for the quarter include revenues of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $1.06 on a non-GAAP basis, and $0.57 on a full GAAP basis. Our GAAP results were impacted by several items in the quarter and I’ll take you through the list of exclusion in a few slides. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, we’re up in revenues, operating income and EBITDA as a result of the inorganic move we made, including both the Actavis Generics acquisition and the joint venture with Takeda in Japan. As this is our second full quarter with Actavis, I will take you through also to a comparison with Q4 2016 in a few slides. Our cash flow from operations this quarter was unusually low as we had a number of large irregular items, and I will share the details shortly. We did receive approximately $700 million in January for the divestment of portion of the Actavis business in the UK and Ireland, but this is not part of our cash flow from operation. However, we use it to pay down debt. Non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter amounted to $0.5 billion. The largest line item is amortization, reflecting the run rate of the combined company. We had relatively high restructuring expenses, which are related to the efficiency measures we are taking throughout the company, both related to our integration with Actavis and to the additional measures being taken. We also excluded $52 million, which are related to the decrease in the British pound, which affected the value of the assets sold in the UK and Ireland, which were already divested. We adjusted exchange rate I used for Venezuela bolivar twice during 2016 as you already heard from Yitzhak and once again, in February 2017, to 380 bolivars per dollar, this is a blended rate. This has a negative impact of $270 million on revenues and $67 million on operating income as compared to Q1 in 2016. So there was no contribution for Venezuela to our earnings per share this quarter, zero. In light of the economic condition in Venezuela, we excluded the quarterly changes in revenue as operating profit in any discussion of currency effect, as you can see in the table. Other than the bolivar, foreign-exchange impact on our results in the quarter was relatively minor. As to EBITDA, Q1 EBITDA was $1.8 billion and EBITDA for the last four quarter totaled $7.5 billion. Cash flow. Cash flow from operation in the quarter was $0.5 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2016, reflecting several unusual payments made during the quarter. These were FCPA settlement with the SEC and DOJ for more than $0.5 billion, $110 million related to ciprofloxacin settlement and $250 million for the final settlement of our forward starting interest rate swap and treasury lock agreement that mature during the first half of 2017, but with settlement paid in first quarter of 2017. Process from divestiture related to Actavis Generics of $700 million or a bit more in Q1 2017 are not included in this chart. Looking at the rest of the year, just as our revenues and earnings are back-end loaded, we expect the same pattern for our cash flow from operation. We also are planning on a significant recovery in the second half of the year from Allergan as a true-up to our working capital. Cash management remains a top priority for the company and the finance team. Liquidity. At the end of Q1 2017, with total debt, excluding minority shares of $34.6 billion, our debt to EBITDA stood at 4.63 times and the net debt-to-EBITDA, which is used for complying with the bank debt covenant stood at 4.49 times, way below the threshold requirement. Compared with the first quarter of 2016, you can see the growth of our generic business both in the U.S. and globally. Copaxone revenues declined slightly and our other specialty products declined mostly as a result of the loss of exclusivity for Nuvigil and Azilect. However, this decline was offset by a payment of $75 million related to the Ninlaro deal, which is included in this quarter. You can also see the impact of the Venezuela devaluation, which reduced revenue by over $200 million year over year. Looking at where we made our sales, the U.S. continues to be the largest market with 56% of revenue. European revenues accounted for 27% of total, and our rest of the world markets are 17%, down from 19% of total last year. Following the inorganic moves of the past year, generics now accounts for 54% of total revenues with Copaxone down to 17%. Other revenues are up significantly following the acquisition of Anda, which contributed almost $300 million for the quarter to our top line. The increase in our operating profit was driven mainly by our generic business following the closing of the Actavis transaction. Our specialty business contributed less following the loss of exclusivity of Nuvigil and Azilect as well as the lower profit coming from Copaxone this quarter. All the moving parts resulted in a similar level of profit, though from somewhat different sources. Generics is now 42% of our operating profit without G&A, while Copaxone is down to 40% of total. The profitability of our U.S. Generics business was very stable this quarter, but there were some movements in other parts of the business. The lower gross profit compared to Q4 is driven by the devaluation in Venezuela, which reduced revenues by about $400 million from Q4. In addition, compared to Q4, operating profit was impacted by the divestment of certain of the UK and Ireland assets that were included in Q4 and was very nice profitability. And this was divested, as mentioned, in January this year; and in addition, by somewhat lower revenues in Japan. Copaxone, Copaxone performance is in line, with ex-U.S. sales maintaining a level of approximately $190 million. This reflects the penetration of Copaxone 40-milligram globally and now also outside of U.S, which is over 70% of the units in Europe. In the U.S., the quarter was relatively soft from lower volume of Copaxone 20-milligram, partially offset by a price increase of 7.9% in January 2017 for both 20-milligram and 40-milligram versions. Now I’d like to take you through two additional slides, bridging Q4 2016 and Q1. This is the first time we can look at two sequential quarters of the new Teva, which are comparable. On revenues, you can see the U.S. Generic business was stable compared to Q4, a bit higher, while ex-U.S. we saw lower generic revenues in Japan and in Europe following the divestiture of the UK and Irish business in January. In specialty, we saw lower revenues of Copaxone as well as the impact of loss of exclusivity of Azilect and Nuvigil also compared to Q4. We also had lower payments received in connection with Ninlaro, which were $75 million this quarter and $50 million in Q4. Obviously, the biggest piece is the Venezuela devaluation, which reduced revenues compared to Q4 by $400 million. Our operating income from Q4 to Q1 declined by 70%. While gross profit margin of our U.S. Generic business remained stable, overall gross profit and gross margin was impacted by the Venezuela devaluation, our business in Japan, and the divestment in the UK. Lower Ninlaro income was also a contributor to lower profit and profitability. On the other hand, you can see our efficiency initiative, which reduced our operating expenses across the board and mitigated some of the decline in the gross profit, and we expect this trend to continue throughout the year. On our balance sheet compared to December 31, 2016, our balance sheet amounted to total assets of $91.3 billion and total equity of $34 billion. Let me discuss the share count, as we have made a change. It doesn’t have an impact, it’s fully offset this quarter, but I want to clarify that. The number of shares this quarter on both GAAP and non-GAAP is 1.017 billion shares, and it’s non-GAAP and GAAP, which is exactly the same. This number is equal to the 1.076 billion shares, so let me explain how. As of December 31, 2016, the number of shares on a non-GAAP basis was 1.076 billion. This did not change. However, this quarter, the effect of the MCPS, which is a mandatory convertible share, was anti-dilutive. So we did not add back $66 million of special dividend to MCPS holders. We didn’t add it back to the net income attributable to ordinary shareholders, nor did we increase the number of shares by 59.4 million shares. This was no income on our earnings per share, which would have remained $1.06 in either treatment, as these two entries offset each other. And last, dividend, our board approved a dividend of $0.34 per share for the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, Teva’s board approves dividend payments every quarter after considering the financial condition of the company. Thank you all for listening to us this morning, and I would now like to open the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Gregg Gilbert. Please ask your question. Gregg Gilbert Hi. I’ll ask one multipart question up front. First for Sol, what have you learned so far from the CEO search and what candidates see as pros and cons? Second, are the Women’s Health and European Oncology/Pain businesses the only businesses for which you’re exploring options? And last, generics in the U.S., are you still as confident as you were before in the flow and size of new product sales from launches in 2017? And can you provide any specific color on some of those key launches? Thanks. Sol Barer So this is Sol Barer, I’ll take the first question in terms of the CEO search. I have to say that we are looking, as everyone knows, for the best person to lead Teva. And we’re looking around the world for this individual who has strong pharmaceutical experience, is a leader, understands the complex situations, has a great deal of integrity, corporate responsibility, et cetera. And the one thing that I’m surprised about, to be very honest about it, is the quality of people that we are talking with. The senior leaders, the ones with experience, I’m very happy with. So again, this takes some time, but I’m very encouraged in terms of who we are talking to. Gregg Gilbert Great. Yitzhak Peterburg So regarding – hi, Gregg, it’s Yitzhak. Gregg Gilbert Hi. Yitzhak Peterburg So regarding your second question, those are the main, exactly as we said, including some other assets. Some of them are only financial assets and real estate assets, and very small other assets. I don’t think we need to go through it. The main two assets we identified really undergoing as we speak. And as I said, we hope to finalize it during this year. On the third question about generic, I ask Dipankar if you can comment. Thank you. Dipankar Bhattacharjee Yes. Good morning, Gregg. Regarding the U.S. new product launches, as we described before, we are targeting more than 80 different product opportunities that are expected to yield between 40 and 50 launches this year. When we look at the breakdown of all these opportunities, the products where we have a high level of confidence in our ability to launch them this year due to a clear position from legal, regulatory, and operational readiness, these are expected to generate approximately $500 million. Our ability to generate additional sales beyond the $500 million is the degree of success we achieve from the basket where there is a higher level of risk related to legal, regulatory, and operational readiness, as well as the competitive environment. It is the breadth and the depth of our generics pipeline that provides us with these numerous opportunities, or as we have said in the past, more shots at goal every year. And regarding the timing of launches, as you know, most of our 2017 launches are in the second half of the year. Gregg Gilbert Thanks. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin. Please ask your question. Jami Rubin Thank you. Just a couple. Sol, just back to the CEO search. I think I asked this question before, I don’t know that I got any answer, but would you be willing to waive the requirement for a CEO to live in Israel? And the second question is you said that $1 billion of the $5 billion of debt repayment this year will come from the divestitures. Would incremental asset sale proceeds beyond the $1 billion accelerate debt repayment, or will there be other uses of proceeds? And just my final question, Eyal, to you, just – I didn’t completely understand the explanation of the drivers of gross margin deterioration this quarter. Can you explain that again? Thanks very much. Sol Barer Okay. So this is Sol Barer. I’ll answer the first question with respect to the CEO. As I indicated, Jami, we are looking around the world for the absolute best candidate for Teva. We are committed, once we find that candidate, to bring that candidate to Teva and we will do what it takes to make that happen. Okay, to be very clear about that. Jami Rubin Okay, thanks. Eyal Desheh Okay. So first of all, you asked about acceleration. Yes, we would like to pay down debt faster and de-lever the balance sheet. Regarding drivers of gross margin, compared to Q1 last year, this is a different company. We have the Anda business which comes – it’s a distribution business, naturally with a much lower margin than our other businesses, both the generic and the specialty. And we have divested the UK piece. That has a small impact, but it came with very nice profitability. And of course we’ve talked a lot about the impact of Venezuela which basically – the profit completely disappeared and there is zero profit on $21 million of sales in the results of Q1. So the impact of all these drivers has reduced the gross margin to where we are today. It could improve a little bit later on this year with new launches of generic products, but this is the area, it could be a bit better. Jami Rubin Can you just – a quick follow up. We thought you had said about $900 million in new product sales this year. Did you bring that down? I just want to make sure I heard that right. And I guess to what extent has pricing pressure in the business paid or had an impact on your gross margins? Sol Barer Dipankar, new product sale. Dipankar Bhattacharjee Yeah. Our new product sales, we had even in earlier conversation spoke about 80 different product opportunities. That basket still remains the same. Jami Rubin Did you give us a total number? I may have misheard you, but I thought you had given us a total number of $900 million, just want to square that with what you’re saying today? Dipankar Bhattacharjee No, I don’t believe so. Eyal Desheh No, it was not $900 million. Jami Rubin Okay, thanks. Eyal Desheh The second one, Jami, on the pricing pressure, it did not have an impact on our gross margin. I think we said in the prepared remarks, the gross profit margin of our U.S. business or U.S. Generic business remains exactly the same, it’s around 55% or a bit higher and did not suffer – was not impacted by pricing pressure in generics in Q1. Jami Rubin Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Finkelstein. Please ask your question. Andrew Finkelstein Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First off, just in fourth quarter, there were some one-time income from a deal with Takeda in Japan, just curious if there were any proceeds from transactions like that in the current quarter? And then if you could talk at all just about what you’re seeing from the FDA in terms of improving the predictability of reviews for complex generics since there’s a number of them that are a potentially meaningful swing factor in your second half results? Yitzhak Peterburg So in Q4, we included $150 million of sales from Ninlaro product to Takeda. This quarter, we grew to $75 million from the same source. Andrew Finkelstein But no other transactions like that? Yitzhak Peterburg Yeah. Eyal Desheh No. Yitzhak Peterburg No? Hafrun Fridriksdottir Hi, good morning. This is Hafrun speaking. So with regards to working with FDA and seeing some improvement in the time lines there especially for complex generics, we are clearly seeing much more activity from FDA than we saw in the past. And we had been working very closely with them on some of the complex generics, which we have filed over the last few years. So clearly, we’re seeing improvements there. Andrew Finkelstein Okay, thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao. Please ask your question. Morgan Williams Hi, this is Morgan Williams on for Doug. So I was just hoping, I have a few questions. Number one, number of competitors said that the consolidation in the customer base is beneficial to a large manufacturer of generics. Are you seeing the same dynamics? Just asking for some more color around your commentary on generic performance this quarter. And then secondly, I was just hoping you can maybe provide a little bit more background on the AUSTEDO launch strategy and more on your rationale for pricing the product at a discount to competitors? Dipankar Bhattacharjee Yes. So first, let me take the question that you raised on customer consolidation. So while customer consolidation does raise some pressure on some of our generics manufacturers, we also see opportunities to increase our strategic partnership with our key customers. So our unique global reach, our broad portfolio, and our deep R&D capability to bring a pipeline of new products will create strategic value for both us as well as our customers. Eyal Desheh And on the question on AUSTEDO, so you heard from Yitzhak, we’re really very pleased with the initial feedback from the market. There is a very good reaction from both patients, physicians and also payers. As you also know, we are developing this product and are awaiting an approval in tardive dyskinesia. So we’ve priced it to really meet with both ends of the spectrum in Huntington’s and in tardive dyskinesia. And we really believe that with this we have an incredibly good value for all stakeholders and initial feedback really confirms this. Michael Hayden Also just to add one, Michael here, why this is being so well received by both patients as well as physicians is the impact of this drug. Chorea really incapacitates these patients. This has major effect on chorea, also impacts swallowing and improves nutrition. And these are well recognized as major impact, without the side effects that you see with tetrabenazine. So overall, an excellent safety and efficacy profile for this product. Morgan Williams Okay, thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Amsellem. Please ask your question. David Amsellem Thanks. So just first on divestitures. Just expanding on some of the earlier questions. So what’s the rationale for keeping the U.S. Oncology business, but just divesting the European Oncology business only bearing in mind that you don’t really have a pipeline in oncology? So that’s number one. And then second, anything new to say on the EpiPen generic and what are your expectations there? Thank you. Rob Koremans Hi. This is Rob. Happy to talk about the U.S. Oncology business. It’s a very important business for us. Bendeka is really doing extremely well with almost a 98% conversion and doing extremely well there. We have an important deal with Celltrion where we will be launching in 2018 and 2019 two biosimilars, so this really is a very important business and it fits perfectly with us. For Europe, what we see is it’s different. We have a different portfolio in Europe than in the U.S. and we just don’t have enough of the pipeline to be able to feed neither the oncology products itself and it’s also the pain products in there and we believe that someone else could be a better owner, and it would definitely help to decrease our dips there. So we’ve taken the decision to try and divest this, but the onco business for us, with the opportunity for the Celltrion products, is really important going forward. Hafrun Fridriksdottir So comment on EpiPen. So this probably remains to be a top priority for Teva. And this is one of the product which we are working very closely with the FDA on. We still see a meaningful opportunity for a true AB-rated generic here. And as a reminder, we have a settlement agreement with Mylan, which allow us to launch upon approval of our ANDA. The outlook for this product has not changed from prior statements, so we are targeting an early launch in early 2018. David Amsellem Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal. Please ask your question. Ronny Gal Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. Actually, I’m going to try to sneak in three. The first one is about cost-reduction. Eyal, how should we expect the operating line to progress during the year? You had a one-time benefit on SG&A this quarter, but if we kind of think about quarters two, three or four, should we just from the outside seek ongoing reduction on those operating lines or should they be in absolute numbers, roughly flat.  Second, the issue of selling respiratory, you seem to have a little bit of air to breathe here with Advair through generics being delayed. This looks like it’s a contractual sale to the PBMs or the big buyers. Can you tell us where you stand on this? And essentially, when should we begin to see contribution for this product, is it this year or only in the 2018 contracts? And last, to Sol, I guess, as a representative of the board, some of the discussion we’re having here on the investment side is whether dividend should be suspended for a couple of years to bring down the debt level. And obviously you guys had to struggle with this question as well. Is this something that you will consider under any circumstances? Or is this something that you’ve essentially rejected in an absolute sense? Eyal Desheh Hi, Ronny. Good morning. So on cost reduction, we’re progressing very well, a little better than already pretty ambitious plans. So we are seeing the results. The company has reduced head count by almost 5,000 employees since we closed the transaction with Actavis on August 2, and about 1,700 from the beginning of this year and the impact of that will be seen later on this year. It never happens on Q1 when people leave. We are also reducing expenses in the areas which are not headcount or cost of labor related, more efficiencies of cost of goods sold.  So all this is going to be seen as the plan progresses throughout the year and will improve our operating margin. We said it and I’ll repeat it again. This is not a linear year. The second half is expected also to benefit from more launches of our new program mostly coming from the U.S. Generic, and the combination of both will improve the margin. Sol Barer This is Sol. I’m sorry, go ahead. Hafrun Fridriksdottir On your second question, we’ve actually started being active in the market just recently with the sales forces. Key would be, as you indicated, the payers, and to really get on the right formulary access will take some time. The recent news, today’s news on – or actually yesterday’s news on Hikma will help. I think also payers to see that what we have is a very attractive offering, but we will only start to see real sales early quarter three for AirDuo RespiClick. And it’s an experiment we’re doing. I think it’s a good new innovative strategy, but it will not have an immediate ramp up as we need to really make sure that we get formulary access. Ronny Gal Sorry, go ahead. Sol Barer In terms of the dividend, as indicated, our policy hasn’t changed and as Eyal has mentioned, every quarter we as a board evaluate paying the dividend. And obviously, this quarter we have said that we will pay the dividend. I can’t speculate under any circumstances what would happen. I think it should suffice at this point that our policies are the same and that we have met and we have paid a dividend, and in the future every quarter we will do the same. Ronny Gal Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat. Please ask your question. Umer Raffat Hi, thank you so much for taking my questions. I have a few today, if I may. First, Dipankar, on generics, so you’re tracking at guidance-like numbers, but at a lower margin. So I want to understand how you’re thinking about the strategy in generics. Is it a revenue number you’re working towards or an operating profit number? On specialty maybe for Michael, Michael, are you expecting the quarterly CGRP to work? And if so, can you deliver it in a way which doesn’t involve three separate injections every three months? And then finally, for Eyal and Michael, I noticed your slide says your net debt-to-EBITDA this quarter was 4.49x, and I also recall that your covenant requires you to be at 4.25x, so I just wanted to reconcile those two. And finally, I also want to push back a bit on counting Ninlaro as revenues. Thank you. Dipankar Bhattacharjee Thanks, Umer. Regarding the generics question that you asked, we do look at a combination of both revenues and our margins and not one or the other. Regarding the revenues, it’s obviously a combination of what we see happening in our base business in the U.S., our new product launches that our strong R&D capabilities bring. And also we look at a combination of how our business moves within the U.S. and non-U.S. because from a revenue standpoint, you do have to recall and remember that about 55% of our generics revenue comes from outside the U.S. In terms of what we would expect and how we would track for the rest of the year, we would expect the current levels of price erosion that we have spoken about will remain for the rest of the year. It is embedded in our forecast. And our new product launch revenues, as I mentioned earlier in one of the questions, is we continue to look at that basket and we continue to look at the 40 to 50 launch opportunities that we have. Michael Hayden Thank you, Umer, for the question on fremanezumab. We’re obviously optimistic about quarterly injection. We’re the only company that actually is looking at both monthly and quarterly. And the reason we’re having some optimism is the long half-life of this particular product that we’ve seen before with very low immunogenicity. So we’re exploring this. We expect to have the results of this before the end of June, and we will be able to see whether a quarterly dose injected just quarterly would be sufficient to have the impact.  We also note that our efficacy in the Phase 2 was the best in the class. And so that also, together with the long half-life and low immunogenicity, gives us some optimism. But data will be available for us to really assess this in the very near future. Eyal Desheh Umer, regarding the covenants, the requirement right now is 5.25x, so at 4.49x we are way below that. By year end, it will go to 4.25x, and we see no problems or issue to comply with that. Next question? Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger. Please ask your question. David Risinger Yes, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone, and congrats, Eyal, and best of luck to you. I have a couple of questions.  Eyal Desheh Thank you. David Risinger First, with respect to the $200 million in additional cost savings this year, is that a full year benefit to 2017 guidance? Second, with respect to the new product launches in 2017, I wasn’t quite clear on that. Could you restate what amount of new product launch revenue you expect in 2017 in the U.S. and globally? And then finally, with respect to the CGRP, Michael, could you just update us on the Phase 3 readout timing and the timing of filing in the U.S. and EU? Thank you. Eyal Desheh Thank you, David, for your kind words. The additional $200 million in cost savings are included in our guidance. They’re not in addition to the guidance. We reiterated the guidance, we reiterated the range. This will help us to be within the range in face of some challenges that Yitzhak has mentioned in his introduction, so we can just take that and add it. Michael Hayden Thanks for the question, David. With regard to results, as I said, we’re expecting the results of CGRP for both chronic and episodic migraine before the end of June. We plan to file for the FDA before the end of 2017, so this is a little earlier than we had stated previously. This reflects the fact that the trial is ending a little early because of the very rapid recruitment that occurred both for chronic as well as for episodic. Just to remind you, of course, also, this program also is using – this is using CGRP antagonist as add-on therapy, so we’re getting a lot of the real-world scenario evidence, which will provide a very unique piece of information that will yield great value to doctors and this will be important. And so we’re expecting to be, depending on when Amgen files second in episodic and potentially first for chronic, depending on Amgen submission dates. David Risinger And you’ll release your press release in June, the data? Michael Hayden The moment we have top-line results, this will be press released before the end of June. David Risinger Okay, thank you. Dipankar Bhattacharjee I’ll take the question on the new product launch revenues for generics. And I will repeat what I had said earlier is that the number that I said was specific to our U.S. new product launches and we continue to look at our basket of 80 different product opportunities. They should yield between what we expect as 40 to 50 launches, products where we have a high certainty because of clearance on legal, regulatory, and our operational readiness. Will we expect to bring approximately $500 million of revenue? We do have a higher risk basket, which has higher risks around legal and regulatory and our ability to go beyond the $500 million and to the extent we can, will depend on how we overcome these regulatory and legal and operational readiness barrier. But these are revenues and new product launches that are specific to the U.S. We also have a substantial business outside of the U.S. which also has new product revenues which I did not allude to. But they will add to the $500 million that we have. David Risinger Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham. Please ask your question. Liav Abraham Good morning. Just a couple of questions here. Firstly, for Eyal, given the cash flow in the first quarter, I know you did make comments on the trajectory of cash flow throughout the remainder of the year. But can you just confirm that you are also reaffirming your cash flow guidance for the year of $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion? Secondly, and apologies for flogging a dead horse here. I know the question has been asked a few times, but my understanding is that in the past you guided to $850 million of new product launches in the U.S. Are you no longer guiding to that number? Is it $500 million plus the option for an additional $350 million more? I just want to make sure on that. And again, apologies, I know, it’s been asked. And then lastly, just a follow on question, your covenants. There continues to be concern from investors on meeting your covenants over – and the covenant progression over the next couple of years. Would you consider renegotiating these in order to provide yourselves and perhaps the investment community with some more confidence and breathing room. Thank you. Eyal Desheh Yeah. So maybe I’ll take the first and the third question, and then Dipankar would address the second one. So, yes, we are reaffirming the cash flow guidance. And as I mentioned on the call, Q1 has a very unusual large number of one-time cash related events that we don’t expect to repeat later on this year. But I also said and I repeat that, that the year is not linear on business performance and cash flow alike and the second half will be stronger than the first. Regarding our covenants, we see no need to renegotiate or negotiate the covenants. We believe that we’ll meet them in the near and the long term. Liav Abraham And apologies from my end, just on the second question I asked on the generics. I think you guided to $750 million in the U.S. earlier at Q4 earnings, not $850 million. So I just wanted to clarify that. Dipankar Bhattacharjee Yeah. So thank you Liav. So again, I will reiterate what I have said and how it relates to the number that you mentioned is that, that in the basket of products that we have, the ones that we have a very high certainty of launching because of clearances that we have from a legal and IP standpoint in the U.S. amounts to $500 million, right. Beyond that there are a number of opportunities that we continue to look at, okay, which has higher risks around legal and regulatory barriers, and our ability to get closer to the number that you’re speaking about is the degree of success that we have in overcoming those. Yitzhak Peterburg And I want to make sure that we never said $850 million. Liav Abraham Correct. I said $750 million. I corrected myself, apologies for that. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan. Please ask your question. Vamil Divan Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one on the pipeline and then one back on the financials. You mentioned laquinimod and the disappointing data there for RRMS, but you’re continuing still on PPMS and also Huntington’s. I’m just curious of any updated thoughts in those two indications and your expectations are now lower for the products succeeding there? And then I just got a couple of emails here, so I just want to clarify also. You mentioned the added synergies you think you’ll get from Actavis this year and presumably that’s a boost to your full year outlook. What is sort of the offsets that’s kind of keeping your full year outlook the same? Is it more of the FX in Venezuela, is there other factors, is it the margins? What’s sort of leading to the outlook to remaining the same despite that added synergies? Thanks. Michael Hayden Thank you, Vamil, Michael here. Just to give a quick update on laquinimod. Of course, we were disappointed with the failure to achieve the primary endpoint which just confirm disease progression. But we were interested in the secondary results, which showed a 40% decrease in brain atrophy, a 28% decrease in time-to-first relapse, and also a 25% decrease in relapse rate. So this confirmed the neuroprotective effect of laquinimod and as such, the study on progressive MS, which is a disease much more progressive to brain atrophy, we’re expecting those results in the third quarter. And the Huntington’s study, which is ongoing, will continue to a readout next year. The reason we’re continuing is that certainly we’ve seen the neuroprotective effect, there’s data from other studies, we understand the mechanism and these studies are in full progress, fully recruited, and so this will be continued to the endpoint. Of course, progressive MS, I think we have lower expectations based on the results in relapsing-remitting. Operator Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Chris Schott. Please ask your question. Chris Schott Great. Thanks very much for the question. Just one coming back on generic gross margins. I think the earlier comments you said that we could think about some modest improvements from these Q1 levels as the year progressed. Can you elaborate a little bit about longer-term trends on margins? Where do you see generic gross margins moving longer term given some of the adjustments we had with the Venezuela business, et cetera? My second question was on the three businesses that you’re looking to divest. Can you just help us a little bit in terms of the size and the profitability of those business? I know you break out the Women’s Health sales. Can you give us the sales on the EU Oncology and Pain franchises? And how do we think about margins for those businesses, I guess should we think about margins in line with your overall specialty franchise, should we think about just what could happen with the P&L as those potentially go away? Thanks so much. Eyal Desheh Hi, Chris. So gross margin on generic, we expect that to go back to the level that we’ve seen in the past few quarter, 48%, 49% later on this year. This is based on both higher-margin products that we intend to sell, launching new product that always come with higher margin and of course, cost-reduction improvement from the other side, both of them are going to improve. Gross margin and operating profit margin that we expected will be around 29%, 30% for the year to complement the higher gross margin that we will experience later on. Chris Schott And just a quick follow-up, 29% to 30%, is that a good run rate going forward, or can you give us a little bit of thoughts about just as we think about the longer-term progression of generics, is that a good run rate, or should that continue to improve over time? Eyal Desheh Yeah. I don’t want to talk to the much longer term, but when we’re talking about 2017, these are the run rate that we assume. Chris Schott Thank you. Rob Koremans And Chris, this is Rob. On your question to the Women’s Health business, it’s about $516 million in revenues and has a very good and healthy contribution. And the same is true for the Onco Pain in Europe. That’s about $360 million in revenues in 2016 and again, very, very contribution margin. So should be very attractive assets to divest and notably on the Women’s Health. This is a business that doesn’t strongly depend on R&D impact and it’s very sustainable products and I think a new buyer will really also benefit from them. Chris Schott Thank you. Yitzhak Peterburg Okay. So I want to thank all of you for your participation. See you most probably in the next quarter. Good luck everybody. Good morning. Operator Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Gregg Gilbert. Please ask your question. Gregg Gilbert Hi. I’ll ask one multipart question up front. First for Sol, what have you learned so far from the CEO search and what candidates see as pros and cons? Second, are the Women’s Health and European Oncology/Pain businesses the only businesses for which you’re exploring options? And last, generics in the U.S., are you still as confident as you were before in the flow and size of new product sales from launches in 2017? And can you provide any specific color on some of those key launches? Thanks. Sol Barer So this is Sol Barer, I’ll take the first question in terms of the CEO search. I have to say that we are looking, as everyone knows, for the best person to lead Teva. And we’re looking around the world for this individual who has strong pharmaceutical experience, is a leader, understands the complex situations, has a great deal of integrity, corporate responsibility, et cetera. And the one thing that I’m surprised about, to be very honest about it, is the quality of people that we are talking with. The senior leaders, the ones with experience, I’m very happy with. So again, this takes some time, but I’m very encouraged in terms of who we are talking to. Gregg Gilbert Great. Yitzhak Peterburg So regarding – hi, Gregg, it’s Yitzhak. Gregg Gilbert Hi. Yitzhak Peterburg So regarding your second question, those are the main, exactly as we said, including some other assets. Some of them are only financial assets and real estate assets, and very small other assets. I don’t think we need to go through it. The main two assets we identified really undergoing as we speak. And as I said, we hope to finalize it during this year. On the third question about generic, I ask Dipankar if you can comment. Thank you. Dipankar Bhattacharjee Yes. Good morning, Gregg. Regarding the U.S. new product launches, as we described before, we are targeting more than 80 different product opportunities that are expected to yield between 40 and 50 launches this year. When we look at the breakdown of all these opportunities, the products where we have a high level of confidence in our ability to launch them this year due to a clear position from legal, regulatory, and operational readiness, these are expected to generate approximately $500 million. Our ability to generate additional sales beyond the $500 million is the degree of success we achieve from the basket where there is a higher level of risk related to legal, regulatory, and operational readiness, as well as the competitive environment. It is the breadth and the depth of our generics pipeline that provides us with these numerous opportunities, or as we have said in the past, more shots at goal every year. And regarding the timing of launches, as you know, most of our 2017 launches are in the second half of the year. Gregg Gilbert Thanks. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin. Please ask your question. Jami Rubin Thank you. Just a couple. Sol, just back to the CEO search. I think I asked this question before, I don’t know that I got any answer, but would you be willing to waive the requirement for a CEO to live in Israel? And the second question is you said that $1 billion of the $5 billion of debt repayment this year will come from the divestitures. Would incremental asset sale proceeds beyond the $1 billion accelerate debt repayment, or will there be other uses of proceeds? And just my final question, Eyal, to you, just – I didn’t completely understand the explanation of the drivers of gross margin deterioration this quarter. Can you explain that again? Thanks very much. Sol Barer Okay. So this is Sol Barer. I’ll answer the first question with respect to the CEO. As I indicated, Jami, we are looking around the world for the absolute best candidate for Teva. We are committed, once we find that candidate, to bring that candidate to Teva and we will do what it takes to make that happen. Okay, to be very clear about that. Jami Rubin Okay, thanks. Eyal Desheh Okay. So first of all, you asked about acceleration. Yes, we would like to pay down debt faster and de-lever the balance sheet. Regarding drivers of gross margin, compared to Q1 last year, this is a different company. We have the Anda business which comes – it’s a distribution business, naturally with a much lower margin than our other businesses, both the generic and the specialty. And we have divested the UK piece. That has a small impact, but it came with very nice profitability. And of course we’ve talked a lot about the impact of Venezuela which basically – the profit completely disappeared and there is zero profit on $21 million of sales in the results of Q1. So the impact of all these drivers has reduced the gross margin to where we are today. It could improve a little bit later on this year with new launches of generic products, but this is the area, it could be a bit better. Jami Rubin Can you just – a quick follow up. We thought you had said about $900 million in new product sales this year. Did you bring that down? I just want to make sure I heard that right. And I guess to what extent has pricing pressure in the business paid or had an impact on your gross margins? Sol Barer Dipankar, new product sale. Dipankar Bhattacharjee Yeah. Our new product sales, we had even in earlier conversation spoke about 80 different product opportunities. That basket still remains the same. Jami Rubin Did you give us a total number? I may have misheard you, but I thought you had given us a total number of $900 million, just want to square that with what you’re saying today? Dipankar Bhattacharjee No, I don’t believe so. Eyal Desheh No, it was not $900 million. Jami Rubin Okay, thanks. Eyal Desheh The second one, Jami, on the pricing pressure, it did not have an impact on our gross margin. I think we said in the prepared remarks, the gross profit margin of our U.S. business or U.S. Generic business remains exactly the same, it’s around 55% or a bit higher and did not suffer – was not impacted by pricing pressure in generics in Q1. Jami Rubin Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Finkelstein. Please ask your question. Andrew Finkelstein Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First off, just in fourth quarter, there were some one-time income from a deal with Takeda in Japan, just curious if there were any proceeds from transactions like that in the current quarter? And then if you could talk at all just about what you’re seeing from the FDA in terms of improving the predictability of reviews for complex generics since there’s a number of them that are a potentially meaningful swing factor in your second half results? Yitzhak Peterburg So in Q4, we included $150 million of sales from Ninlaro product to Takeda. This quarter, we grew to $75 million from the same source. Andrew Finkelstein But no other transactions like that? Yitzhak Peterburg Yeah. Eyal Desheh No. Yitzhak Peterburg No? Hafrun Fridriksdottir Hi, good morning. This is Hafrun speaking. So with regards to working with FDA and seeing some improvement in the time lines there especially for complex generics, we are clearly seeing much more activity from FDA than we saw in the past. And we had been working very closely with them on some of the complex generics, which we have filed over the last few years. So clearly, we’re seeing improvements there. Andrew Finkelstein Okay, thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao. Please ask your question. Morgan Williams Hi, this is Morgan Williams on for Doug. So I was just hoping, I have a few questions. Number one, number of competitors said that the consolidation in the customer base is beneficial to a large manufacturer of generics. Are you seeing the same dynamics? Just asking for some more color around your commentary on generic performance this quarter. And then secondly, I was just hoping you can maybe provide a little bit more background on the AUSTEDO launch strategy and more on your rationale for pricing the product at a discount to competitors? Dipankar Bhattacharjee Yes. So first, let me take the question that you raised on customer consolidation. So while customer consolidation does raise some pressure on some of our generics manufacturers, we also see opportunities to increase our strategic partnership with our key customers. So our unique global reach, our broad portfolio, and our deep R&D capability to bring a pipeline of new products will create strategic value for both us as well as our customers. Eyal Desheh And on the question on AUSTEDO, so you heard from Yitzhak, we’re really very pleased with the initial feedback from the market. There is a very good reaction from both patients, physicians and also payers. As you also know, we are developing this product and are awaiting an approval in tardive dyskinesia. So we’ve priced it to really meet with both ends of the spectrum in Huntington’s and in tardive dyskinesia. And we really believe that with this we have an incredibly good value for all stakeholders and initial feedback really confirms this. Michael Hayden Also just to add one, Michael here, why this is being so well received by both patients as well as physicians is the impact of this drug. Chorea really incapacitates these patients. This has major effect on chorea, also impacts swallowing and improves nutrition. And these are well recognized as major impact, without the side effects that you see with tetrabenazine. So overall, an excellent safety and efficacy profile for this product. Morgan Williams Okay, thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Amsellem. Please ask your question. David Amsellem Thanks. So just first on divestitures. Just expanding on some of the earlier questions. So what’s the rationale for keeping the U.S. Oncology business, but just divesting the European Oncology business only bearing in mind that you don’t really have a pipeline in oncology? So that’s number one. And then second, anything new to say on the EpiPen generic and what are your expectations there? Thank you. Rob Koremans Hi. This is Rob. Happy to talk about the U.S. Oncology business. It’s a very important business for us. Bendeka is really doing extremely well with almost a 98% conversion and doing extremely well there. We have an important deal with Celltrion where we will be launching in 2018 and 2019 two biosimilars, so this really is a very important business and it fits perfectly with us. For Europe, what we see is it’s different. We have a different portfolio in Europe than in the U.S. and we just don’t have enough of the pipeline to be able to feed neither the oncology products itself and it’s also the pain products in there and we believe that someone else could be a better owner, and it would definitely help to decrease our dips there. So we’ve taken the decision to try and divest this, but the onco business for us, with the opportunity for the Celltrion products, is really important going forward. Hafrun Fridriksdottir So comment on EpiPen. So this probably remains to be a top priority for Teva. And this is one of the product which we are working very closely with the FDA on. We still see a meaningful opportunity for a true AB-rated generic here. And as a reminder, we have a settlement agreement with Mylan, which allow us to launch upon approval of our ANDA. The outlook for this product has not changed from prior statements, so we are targeting an early launch in early 2018. David Amsellem Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal. Please ask your question. Ronny Gal Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. Actually, I’m going to try to sneak in three. The first one is about cost-reduction. Eyal, how should we expect the operating line to progress during the year? You had a one-time benefit on SG&A this quarter, but if we kind of think about quarters two, three or four, should we just from the outside seek ongoing reduction on those operating lines or should they be in absolute numbers, roughly flat.  Second, the issue of selling respiratory, you seem to have a little bit of air to breathe here with Advair through generics being delayed. This looks like it’s a contractual sale to the PBMs or the big buyers. Can you tell us where you stand on this? And essentially, when should we begin to see contribution for this product, is it this year or only in the 2018 contracts? And last, to Sol, I guess, as a representative of the board, some of the discussion we’re having here on the investment side is whether dividend should be suspended for a couple of years to bring down the debt level. And obviously you guys had to struggle with this question as well. Is this something that you will consider under any circumstances? Or is this something that you’ve essentially rejected in an absolute sense? Eyal Desheh Hi, Ronny. Good morning. So on cost reduction, we’re progressing very well, a little better than already pretty ambitious plans. So we are seeing the results. The company has reduced head count by almost 5,000 employees since we closed the transaction with Actavis on August 2, and about 1,700 from the beginning of this year and the impact of that will be seen later on this year. It never happens on Q1 when people leave. We are also reducing expenses in the areas which are not headcount or cost of labor related, more efficiencies of cost of goods sold.  So all this is going to be seen as the plan progresses throughout the year and will improve our operating margin. We said it and I’ll repeat it again. This is not a linear year. The second half is expected also to benefit from more launches of our new program mostly coming from the U.S. Generic, and the combination of both will improve the margin. Sol Barer This is Sol. I’m sorry, go ahead. Hafrun Fridriksdottir On your second question, we’ve actually started being active in the market just recently with the sales forces. Key would be, as you indicated, the payers, and to really get on the right formulary access will take some time. The recent news, today’s news on – or actually yesterday’s news on Hikma will help. I think also payers to see that what we have is a very attractive offering, but we will only start to see real sales early quarter three for AirDuo RespiClick. And it’s an experiment we’re doing. I think it’s a good new innovative strategy, but it will not have an immediate ramp up as we need to really make sure that we get formulary access. Ronny Gal Sorry, go ahead. Sol Barer In terms of the dividend, as indicated, our policy hasn’t changed and as Eyal has mentioned, every quarter we as a board evaluate paying the dividend. And obviously, this quarter we have said that we will pay the dividend. I can’t speculate under any circumstances what would happen. I think it should suffice at this point that our policies are the same and that we have met and we have paid a dividend, and in the future every quarter we will do the same. Ronny Gal Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat. Please ask your question. Umer Raffat Hi, thank you so much for taking my questions. I have a few today, if I may. First, Dipankar, on generics, so you’re tracking at guidance-like numbers, but at a lower margin. So I want to understand how you’re thinking about the strategy in generics. Is it a revenue number you’re working towards or an operating profit number? On specialty maybe for Michael, Michael, are you expecting the quarterly CGRP to work? And if so, can you deliver it in a way which doesn’t involve three separate injections every three months? And then finally, for Eyal and Michael, I noticed your slide says your net debt-to-EBITDA this quarter was 4.49x, and I also recall that your covenant requires you to be at 4.25x, so I just wanted to reconcile those two. And finally, I also want to push back a bit on counting Ninlaro as revenues. Thank you. Dipankar Bhattacharjee Thanks, Umer. Regarding the generics question that you asked, we do look at a combination of both revenues and our margins and not one or the other. Regarding the revenues, it’s obviously a combination of what we see happening in our base business in the U.S., our new product launches that our strong R&D capabilities bring. And also we look at a combination of how our business moves within the U.S. and non-U.S. because from a revenue standpoint, you do have to recall and remember that about 55% of our generics revenue comes from outside the U.S. In terms of what we would expect and how we would track for the rest of the year, we would expect the current levels of price erosion that we have spoken about will remain for the rest of the year. It is embedded in our forecast. And our new product launch revenues, as I mentioned earlier in one of the questions, is we continue to look at that basket and we continue to look at the 40 to 50 launch opportunities that we have. Michael Hayden Thank you, Umer, for the question on fremanezumab. We’re obviously optimistic about quarterly injection. We’re the only company that actually is looking at both monthly and quarterly. And the reason we’re having some optimism is the long half-life of this particular product that we’ve seen before with very low immunogenicity. So we’re exploring this. We expect to have the results of this before the end of June, and we will be able to see whether a quarterly dose injected just quarterly would be sufficient to have the impact.  We also note that our efficacy in the Phase 2 was the best in the class. And so that also, together with the long half-life and low immunogenicity, gives us some optimism. But data will be available for us to really assess this in the very near future. Eyal Desheh Umer, regarding the covenants, the requirement right now is 5.25x, so at 4.49x we are way below that. By year end, it will go to 4.25x, and we see no problems or issue to comply with that. Next question? Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger. Please ask your question. David Risinger Yes, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone, and congrats, Eyal, and best of luck to you. I have a couple of questions.  Eyal Desheh Thank you. David Risinger First, with respect to the $200 million in additional cost savings this year, is that a full year benefit to 2017 guidance? Second, with respect to the new product launches in 2017, I wasn’t quite clear on that. Could you restate what amount of new product launch revenue you expect in 2017 in the U.S. and globally? And then finally, with respect to the CGRP, Michael, could you just update us on the Phase 3 readout timing and the timing of filing in the U.S. and EU? Thank you. Eyal Desheh Thank you, David, for your kind words. The additional $200 million in cost savings are included in our guidance. They’re not in addition to the guidance. We reiterated the guidance, we reiterated the range. This will help us to be within the range in face of some challenges that Yitzhak has mentioned in his introduction, so we can just take that and add it. Michael Hayden Thanks for the question, David. With regard to results, as I said, we’re expecting the results of CGRP for both chronic and episodic migraine before the end of June. We plan to file for the FDA before the end of 2017, so this is a little earlier than we had stated previously. This reflects the fact that the trial is ending a little early because of the very rapid recruitment that occurred both for chronic as well as for episodic. Just to remind you, of course, also, this program also is using – this is using CGRP antagonist as add-on therapy, so we’re getting a lot of the real-world scenario evidence, which will provide a very unique piece of information that will yield great value to doctors and this will be important. And so we’re expecting to be, depending on when Amgen files second in episodic and potentially first for chronic, depending on Amgen submission dates. David Risinger And you’ll release your press release in June, the data? Michael Hayden The moment we have top-line results, this will be press released before the end of June. David Risinger Okay, thank you. Dipankar Bhattacharjee I’ll take the question on the new product launch revenues for generics. And I will repeat what I had said earlier is that the number that I said was specific to our U.S. new product launches and we continue to look at our basket of 80 different product opportunities. They should yield between what we expect as 40 to 50 launches, products where we have a high certainty because of clearance on legal, regulatory, and our operational readiness. Will we expect to bring approximately $500 million of revenue? We do have a higher risk basket, which has higher risks around legal and regulatory and our ability to go beyond the $500 million and to the extent we can, will depend on how we overcome these regulatory and legal and operational readiness barrier. But these are revenues and new product launches that are specific to the U.S. We also have a substantial business outside of the U.S. which also has new product revenues which I did not allude to. But they will add to the $500 million that we have. David Risinger Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham. Please ask your question. Liav Abraham Good morning. Just a couple of questions here. Firstly, for Eyal, given the cash flow in the first quarter, I know you did make comments on the trajectory of cash flow throughout the remainder of the year. But can you just confirm that you are also reaffirming your cash flow guidance for the year of $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion? Secondly, and apologies for flogging a dead horse here. I know the question has been asked a few times, but my understanding is that in the past you guided to $850 million of new product launches in the U.S. Are you no longer guiding to that number? Is it $500 million plus the option for an additional $350 million more? I just want to make sure on that. And again, apologies, I know, it’s been asked. And then lastly, just a follow on question, your covenants. There continues to be concern from investors on meeting your covenants over – and the covenant progression over the next couple of years. Would you consider renegotiating these in order to provide yourselves and perhaps the investment community with some more confidence and breathing room. Thank you. Eyal Desheh Yeah. So maybe I’ll take the first and the third question, and then Dipankar would address the second one. So, yes, we are reaffirming the cash flow guidance. And as I mentioned on the call, Q1 has a very unusual large number of one-time cash related events that we don’t expect to repeat later on this year. But I also said and I repeat that, that the year is not linear on business performance and cash flow alike and the second half will be stronger than the first. Regarding our covenants, we see no need to renegotiate or negotiate the covenants. We believe that we’ll meet them in the near and the long term. Liav Abraham And apologies from my end, just on the second question I asked on the generics. I think you guided to $750 million in the U.S. earlier at Q4 earnings, not $850 million. So I just wanted to clarify that. Dipankar Bhattacharjee Yeah. So thank you Liav. So again, I will reiterate what I have said and how it relates to the number that you mentioned is that, that in the basket of products that we have, the ones that we have a very high certainty of launching because of clearances that we have from a legal and IP standpoint in the U.S. amounts to $500 million, right. Beyond that there are a number of opportunities that we continue to look at, okay, which has higher risks around legal and regulatory barriers, and our ability to get closer to the number that you’re speaking about is the degree of success that we have in overcoming those. Yitzhak Peterburg And I want to make sure that we never said $850 million. Liav Abraham Correct. I said $750 million. I corrected myself, apologies for that. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan. Please ask your question. Vamil Divan Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one on the pipeline and then one back on the financials. You mentioned laquinimod and the disappointing data there for RRMS, but you’re continuing still on PPMS and also Huntington’s. I’m just curious of any updated thoughts in those two indications and your expectations are now lower for the products succeeding there? And then I just got a couple of emails here, so I just want to clarify also. You mentioned the added synergies you think you’ll get from Actavis this year and presumably that’s a boost to your full year outlook. What is sort of the offsets that’s kind of keeping your full year outlook the same? Is it more of the FX in Venezuela, is there other factors, is it the margins? What’s sort of leading to the outlook to remaining the same despite that added synergies? Thanks. Michael Hayden Thank you, Vamil, Michael here. Just to give a quick update on laquinimod. Of course, we were disappointed with the failure to achieve the primary endpoint which just confirm disease progression. But we were interested in the secondary results, which showed a 40% decrease in brain atrophy, a 28% decrease in time-to-first relapse, and also a 25% decrease in relapse rate. So this confirmed the neuroprotective effect of laquinimod and as such, the study on progressive MS, which is a disease much more progressive to brain atrophy, we’re expecting those results in the third quarter. And the Huntington’s study, which is ongoing, will continue to a readout next year. The reason we’re continuing is that certainly we’ve seen the neuroprotective effect, there’s data from other studies, we understand the mechanism and these studies are in full progress, fully recruited, and so this will be continued to the endpoint. Of course, progressive MS, I think we have lower expectations based on the results in relapsing-remitting. Operator Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Chris Schott. Please ask your question. Chris Schott Great. Thanks very much for the question. Just one coming back on generic gross margins. I think the earlier comments you said that we could think about some modest improvements from these Q1 levels as the year progressed. Can you elaborate a little bit about longer-term trends on margins? Where do you see generic gross margins moving longer term given some of the adjustments we had with the Venezuela business, et cetera? My second question was on the three businesses that you’re looking to divest. Can you just help us a little bit in terms of the size and the profitability of those business? I know you break out the Women’s Health sales. Can you give us the sales on the EU Oncology and Pain franchises? And how do we think about margins for those businesses, I guess should we think about margins in line with your overall specialty franchise, should we think about just what could happen with the P&L as those potentially go away? Thanks so much. Eyal Desheh Hi, Chris. So gross margin on generic, we expect that to go back to the level that we’ve seen in the past few quarter, 48%, 49% later on this year. This is based on both higher-margin products that we intend to sell, launching new product that always come with higher margin and of course, cost-reduction improvement from the other side, both of them are going to improve. Gross margin and operating profit margin that we expected will be around 29%, 30% for the year to complement the higher gross margin that we will experience later on. Chris Schott And just a quick follow-up, 29% to 30%, is that a good run rate going forward, or can you give us a little bit of thoughts about just as we think about the longer-term progression of generics, is that a good run rate, or should that continue to improve over time? Eyal Desheh Yeah. I don’t want to talk to the much longer term, but when we’re talking about 2017, these are the run rate that we assume. Chris Schott Thank you. Rob Koremans And Chris, this is Rob. On your question to the Women’s Health business, it’s about $516 million in revenues and has a very good and healthy contribution. And the same is true for the Onco Pain in Europe. That’s about $360 million in revenues in 2016 and again, very, very contribution margin. So should be very attractive assets to divest and notably on the Women’s Health. This is a business that doesn’t strongly depend on R&D impact and it’s very sustainable products and I think a new buyer will really also benefit from them. Chris Schott Thank you. Yitzhak Peterburg Okay. So I want to thank all of you for your participation. See you most probably in the next quarter. Good luck everybody. Good morning. Operator Thank you.

Daniel P. Kelly Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Tellabs' investor call. Today, I'll discuss our activities to make Tellabs more competitive. In a tough industry, we are taking action to make Tellabs a profitable, growing company. We are executing our strategy as we work to create new avenues of revenue growth. Our second quarter revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance range at $212 million. Revenue outside North America was 42% of second quarter revenue compared with 52% in the year-ago quarter. Compared with the first quarter, Tellabs' second quarter results improved. Tellabs increased non-GAAP gross margins from 34.8% in 1Q to 38% in 2Q. We reduced non-GAAP operating expenses dramatically from $95 million to $81 million. And we're on our way to a non-GAAP quarterly operating expense in the mid-$70 million range in the third quarter. In the second quarter, we produced a non-GAAP result of $0.00 per share. Tellabs had strong optical data and services bookings in the second quarter and we finished the quarter with a book-to-bill ratio above 1. In a few minutes, Larry Rieger will share detailed second quarter results and third quarter guidance with you. We named Larry acting CFO a few weeks ago. He brings 40-plus years of experience to Tellabs from Crowe Horwath and Arthur Andersen. Larry has worked closely with Tellabs over the past 10 years, he already knows the company and the finance team. He has hit the ground running here at Tellabs. Now turning to the business. In our Optical segment, Tellabs achieved our highest ever second quarter revenue from the Tellabs 7100 and 7300 products. We recognize revenue from 4 new Optical customers in North America, and in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the second quarter. We deliver a highly integrated compact and metro-optimized Optical Transport Solution. That's how Tellabs provides customers with the ability to cost effectively and flexibly meet growing traffic demand in metro and regional transport networks. Industry analyst, Infonetics, ranks Tellabs as the #1 vendor for metro-regional Packet Optical Transport Solutions. The 100 gig metro optical market is real and growing. During the quarter, we saw a ramp up in demand and shipments of our 100 gig modules around the world. Tellabs enables customers to seamlessly and simultaneously manage 10 gig, 40 gig and 100 gig wavelengths on a single platform. We've shipped 100 gig modules to customers such as CenturyLink, headquartered in the U.S., and Vtesse in the U.K. Both have deployed 100 gig and live networks to provide high-bandwidth business services. Looking to the second half, we expect to gain further customer traction as we roll out our 100 gig module, Optical Transport network or OTN switching, and integrated Ethernet capabilities. In the Access segment, we are shipping a new product, the Tellabs 100 series of mini ONTs or Optical Network Terminals. Our mini ONTs make it easier to install Optical LAN in cubicles and in offices. Tellabs now offers the world's smallest ONT with power over Ethernet. We announced a new enterprise customer for Tellabs Optical LAN, Deltek. We signed up a new distributor, CFC, a unit of WESCO, which booked its first Optical LAN orders in July. We are working to expand our ecosystem of distributors and value-added resellers who handled the Tellabs Optical LAN solution. In the Data segment, during the second quarter, we won 4 new customers for Tellabs Mobile Backhaul solution. We are helping customers migrate to IP radio Access networks that deliver LTE services. Looking to the medium term, we're developing solutions to support customer's needs for small cell backhaul. Earlier this year, we demonstrated easier ways for customers to deploy small cells through self organizing networks or SON. Mobile operators need an efficient solution to reduce operating expenses as they deploy small cells by the thousands. We are innovating with Software-defined networking technology or SDN to improve the economics of Mobile Backhaul networks. We're currently working on several active customer engagements with lab evaluations this year. We recognize that this industry inflection point provides Tellabs the opportunity to offer differentiated SDN applications that span the Optical and data layers, compounding the benefits for customers. Customer stand the benefit through higher bandwidth utilization, reduced capital spending by eliminating overengineered lengths and higher satisfaction among users. Based on customers input, we plan to incorporate SDN functionality into the Tellabs 8000 Intelligent Network Manager and into Tellabs 8600 and Tellabs 7100 products, early in 2014. During the second quarter, Tellabs signed a multiproduct, multiyear agreement with Telstra for the Australian Department of Defence project. This project encompasses Tellabs' data, Optical and Optical LAN products, as well as our professional services. That's just one of many reasons I'm encouraged as we look to Tellabs' future. To sum it up, we're working hard to revitalize Tellabs. We are focused on executing our strategy, creating path to revenue growth, controlling expenses and generating cash. These are the steps ahead on our road to profitability and growth. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tellabs' acting CFO, Larry Rieger, to discuss Tellabs' second quarter results and third quarter outlook. Larry? Lawrence A. Rieger Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. First off, let me say I'm excited to be a part of Tellabs. Over the years, I found working with Tellabs to be stimulating and rewarding, and I expect working for Tellabs will be equally stimulating and rewarding. A few words about my philosophy. I believe the key role of the finance function is to provide good information for decision-making, whether we provide information to decision-makers within the business, our customers or stakeholders like you. As we move ahead, I look forward to getting to know Tellabs' owners and the broader financial community. Now, let's take a look at the second quarter numbers on a sequential basis. Revenue in the second quarter was $212 million, up from $209 million in the first quarter. Higher revenue in the Optical and Data segments more than offset lower revenue in Access. On a GAAP basis, net loss was $8 million in Q2 compared with $56 million in Q1. As you may recall, the first quarter results included $35 million in restructuring charges. GAAP net loss in the second quarter was $0.02 per share compared with $0.16 per share net loss in the first quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring related charges and equity related expenses, net loss in the second quarter was $900,000 or $0.00 per share. Geographically, revenue from customers in North America was $123 million in the second quarter of this year, consistent with the first quarter. North American customers accounted for 58% of the total revenue in the second quarter, and 59% in the first quarter. 2Q revenue from customers outside North America was $89 million, up from $87 million in Q1, increased revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Latin American Caribbean region, more than offset lower revenue in Asia-Pac on a sequential basis. Customers outside North America accounted for 42% of the revenue in the second quarter, and 41% in the first quarter. Let's take a look at the segment data. Optical revenue was $113 million in 2Q, up 21% from $93 million in Q1. The increase in segment revenue was primarily driven by Tellabs 7100 Optical Transport Systems. In 2Q, Optical segment profit primarily driven by higher overall level of revenue was $25 million, nearly double the $13 million we recorded in Q1. Revenue for the Data segment was $36 million, up 9% from the $33 million in Q1. We saw higher revenue from Tellabs' 8100 Managed Access Systems and Tellabs 8600 and 8800 smart routers. Data segment loss in the second quarter was reduced to $3 million compared with a segment loss of $15 million in Q1. The improvement here was driven primarily by lower research and development expenses and lower manufacturing cost. Revenue in the Access segment was $19 million in the second quarter and $39 million in the prior quarter. The change here was driven primarily by lower revenue from Tellabs 1600 single-family ONTs. Access segment profit, which was primarily driven by lower level of revenue and lower gross margins, was $1 million in Q2 compared with $8 million in Q1. Services revenue was $44 million in Q2, consistent with the prior quarter. Services profit improved to $14.8 million in Q2, up from $14.6 million in the prior quarter. Turning to gross margin. Non-GAAP gross margin was 38% in Q2, up 3.2 points from the 34.8% in the prior quarter. Gross margin is highly dependent on product and customer mix, and the improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by improved product mix and lower manufacturing cost. Looking at operating expenses. Non-GAAP OpEx came in at $81 million in 2Q, down 14% from $95 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $42 million in 2Q, down 20% from $52 million in the first quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $40 million, down 7% from $43 million in the first quarter. Other income on a non-GAAP basis was an expense of $1 million in Q2, down from income of $2 million in Q1. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 32% resulted in 0 tax expense. Looking at the balance sheet. Inventory turns were 4.3 in 2Q compared with 4.5 in the first quarter. At the end of the second quarter, inventory was $114 million, compared with $113 million, level that we recorded at the end of the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $5 million in 2Q compared with $3 million in the first quarter. Our overall cash and investment balance at the end of the second quarter totaled $542 million. During the quarter, we used $13 million for previously announced restructurings, $5 million for capital expenses, $5 million for stock repurchases, and $7 million for other changes. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of a common stock at a cost of $4.6 million. The actual number of shares outstanding at the end of 2Q was about $356 million. Of our total cash and investment balance, $126 million was held by subsidiaries outside the United States at the end of the second quarter. Employment at the end of 2Q stood at approximately 2,175 people compared with 2,200 at the end of the prior quarter. The book-to-bill ratio was above 1 on a quarterly basis. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2013. We're looking at our booking trends, our backlog, and we're mindful of the current market conditions and the uncertainty in Europe and the rest of the world, we expect 3Q revenue to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million. We expect 3Q non-GAAP gross margin to be about 37%, plus or minus 1 point or 2, depending on mix. We also expect non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter to be down from the second quarter, in the mid-$70 million range. In addition, we expect non-GAAP tax rate to be about 32%. Now, operator, let's open the floor for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Genovese with MKM Partners. Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division I really just have one question. With the bookings solid, the book-to-bill above 1, your bookings picking up in Data and Optical. Guidance, basically, looks flat quarter-over-quarter. Is this conservatives and is this because the bookings are longer term in nature and you expect them come to revenues multi-quarter? Can you just talk about the kind of better business tone versus the flat guidance and [indiscernible] that issue that will be great. Daniel P. Kelly Okay, thanks, Michael. This is Dan. I think the short answer to your question is that, it was a very strong bookings quarter. Certainly, Optical and Data, and your answer -- or my answer was buried in your question. Some of those bookings do go beyond 1 quarter. Michael Genovese - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division Can you talk about actually just as a follow-up talk about that a little bit more. I mean, probably some of them -- some of the bookings you probably do have good visibility, third quarter revenues. On the high end of this bookings, I mean, are these all within a year? Could some of them slip beyond 1 year? Or basically, are they all within 12 months where you get revenues or is there some beyond that? That will be helpful. Daniel P. Kelly Sure. No problem, Michael. The answer to that question is the bookings and the time horizons as they're all different. Some of them are within 1 quarter. Some of them are within 1 year. And in some cases, they will stretch beyond the year, in the case of, where you might have a project that's a couple years long. So those bookings could stretch even beyond that. That's probably more of the exception, I would say they're usually within a quarter or a few quarters. But in particular, some big projects over the last year or so, actually do stretch over 1 year, between 1 to 2 years. Operator Your next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division I just wanted to get you to maybe talk a little bit more about these new Optical customers you got. I mean, how big are they? Did they -- how much did they contribute to the quarter and the growth, just qualitatively, I know you probably can't quantify that, but it will be great if you did quantify it. And then also, can you talk to us about anything different in terms of the 7100, 7300 deployment that you're seeing? Is this mostly core networks? Are you seeing people moving out to the metro? Can you talk us a little bit through what's going on in Optical generally? Daniel P. Kelly Okay, Rod. Let me give some color on a couple of different areas there. It stars some of the dynamics in the Optical area. We did add a few, 4 new customers in the Optical space. Obviously, we don't give detail around those 4 customers. But as you know, from winning these projects to deploying these projects, they do stretch over multiple years. And we have projects that started business we won 10 years ago that we're still selling transponders to. So it does take time, you have to go through certainly lab testing, field trials, et cetera. So when you win 4 customers in 1 quarter, the effect isn't immediate. It's really getting to the lab, getting through the operational support systems and rolling out the product. Some of the dynamics that we saw on the Optical space in the second -- actually first and second quarter, was strong demand in North America in the Optical space. And I know a lot of you guys have pointed that out, as well when you look at CapEx from the big carriers in North America. We see a lot of that driven by the video demand and video build out, as well as wireless traffic being carried over these networks. So that certainly 1 dynamic that we see, and I don't think that's going to go away. The other dynamic is, as we announced couple of our 100 gig customers, and again, where we really focus is not in the long-haul summary, we focus in the metro-regional space with the Tellabs 7100. And with the 7300, the ability to aggregate Ethernet traffic all the way out to the edge. So we're seeing 100 gig, obviously first in the long-haul networks, migrating in the demand there, in the metro-regional networks. And in my words a few minutes ago, CenturyLink, the task, a couple of our 100 gig customers, and we have many others and so I think we're just at the beginning of what is a very real beginning of 100 gig rollout in the metro-regional space. Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Okay. And then, Dan, could you -- one thing you guys said on the Access side of the business, the Optical LAN, it feels like the enterprise campus is really moving to Wi-Fi. And I'm surprised that you guys talking too much about Optical LAN. Can you expand on that a little bit, like what were the application before that? Are these specialized applications, just kind of how big is that market really? Daniel P. Kelly Right. So the size of the market, there's different ways to slice it and no analyst has really come out to give their slice of it. But if you actually look at the enterprise LAN market, it's obviously very, very big. Our focus is on subsegment of that. We don't address the entire market. But since it's such a large market, we do see some interesting opportunities there in the enterprise, we did announce new customer, Deltek in the second quarter. We've also added distributor CFC, part of WESCO. And we're doing more to build out that ecosystem because we do believe in the application. And we get that question a lot about Wi-Fi. And Wi-Fi from the endpoint makes sense, but you can still use the Optical LAN technology on a campus environment to provide a very low cost, high availability, high-bandwidth solution that can then be the backbone for campuses that do have Wi-Fi on the endpoint. So we do see that application as well. We also continue to see opportunities including what we announced earlier this morning, the Australian opportunity, the Department of Defence with Telstra, where we can bundle the Optical LAN with our BDM, ROADM technology into very high bandwidth campus environment. So we also see synergies across that as well. Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Okay. And then -- I just wanted to ask you on Access, I know you made some comments on your prepared remarks. But, I mean, that number -- pretty tough number in Access, is there anything to make you think that things are stabilizing there or likely to improve over the next couple of quarters, or? Daniel P. Kelly Yes, good question. The big downdraft in the second quarter around Access was due to the 1600 deal ONTs and they were much stronger in the first quarter than in the second quarter. But we do see signs of positive signs on the horizon for the 1600 revenue as we look farther out in time. Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division But can you elaborate on what those signs are? Daniel P. Kelly Not really. Operator Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division A handful of things I wanted to touch on. First one was, if you could talk a little bit about the drivers for the upside to gross margin in your June quarter, I presume it's somewhat mixed. But if you could drill down on that a little bit? Daniel P. Kelly Sure, Simon. Happy to do that. The big factor -- there was 2 factors, 1 bigger than the other. The one was, that I mentioned earlier when Rod asked this question was, the downdraft on the 1600. As you know, in ONT, in general, would be lower than corporate average margin. So when that volume drops, that helps us. As well as the strong optical revenue in the second quarter with a better mix around transponders, which have slightly better margin than the common equipment. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Great. Yes, I know and that's what I suspected, was the transponder mix actually. And that was really setting up for my next question is, what portion of your Optical segment sales are 100G today, and how do you see that trending overall? Daniel P. Kelly Yes, so Simon, we don't break out the 100 gig as a subsegment of our Optical segment. Where we're at and what we've announced is new customers rolling out and offering 100 gig services. We have customers in Latin America, we have customers in the EMEA region, and certainly in North America, which is probably leading the demand curve a little faster than some of the other markets. We see that continuing. I think we're at the beginning of what will be a multiyear rollout of 100 gig technology with -- on the Tellabs 7100. And as you know, our platform can support 10, 40 and 100 gig, we've done a lot of engineering work on top of that. So I think we're at the very beginning of what will be a multiyear rollout of 100 gig. We're also investing in and working on 400 gig technology, as well as our next generation, 7100 shelf, which will provide capabilities well beyond into the far future there to support 100 gig and beyond services off that shelf, that can operate within our current 7100 infrastructure. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division So when you were thinking about your guidance for the September quarter, it looks like you're expecting similar to maybe slightly lower gross margin. I'm assuming that what's implied in that forecast might be a little bit of recovery in your Access business, but generally flat sequential terms by segment. It's -- or similar mix, is that fair? Daniel P. Kelly Yes, I think it's probably customer mix comes into play as well, Simon. There, when I looked Q2 to Q3, obviously we try to do everything we can to give you accurate guidance. But also work very hard pushing down OpEx and working hard to increase gross margins, as well as we move throughout the quarter. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division And then just maybe one last one, and I'd like to frame this in really a longer term strategic question. But looking at the international sales on a year-over-year basis, down over 40%. You had a tremendous growth rate, I guess, in 2012 or so on international and now looks like you're facing pretty tough comparisons. What are you doing in terms of trying to turn your year-over-years around other than getting easier comparisons? How are you going to get growth back in the international market? Daniel P. Kelly Right. So a lot of that downdraft, in fact, I would say, you'd probably have to go back to 2011, Simon, because we're certainly seeing the downdraft in the Europe, Western Europe in particular, in the back half of the year. And as we discussed on previous calls that, that did hurt us, there was a downdraft. And a lot of our Europe revenue is with our Data products. It's not that we were losing market share, a lot of it was based on our customer spend in that area. And the downdraft, I would say, began 1 year ago and continues. So what are we doing about it? We're focusing on winning new business like we have in Australia, we're working hard on adding Optical customers in Europe, Middle East and Africa, adding partnerships. We announced a partnership in Italy last quarter as well for our Optical products. So we're not resting. We're moving forward. We're continuing to develop future packages for our customers to upgrade their networks on our data networks, adding and expanding our ecosystem around our Optical business in those markets. And we've also had some challenges in Latin America from a regulation perspective in Mexico, but we're working hard to turn that around and we do see some positive signs on the horizon in Mexico and Latin America. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Great. Appreciate it. And any color you can give us on 10% customers in the quarter? Lawrence A. Rieger Yes, this is Larry, Simon. And we had a 2 10% customers in the quarter. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division North America, international, where were they? Lawrence A. Rieger Sorry, for competitive reasons, we can't talk about that. Operator Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division I wanted to come back to the strength you saw in the Optical segment. Are you able to determine how much of that is based on market share gains for you guys? For example, like expanding your own footprint versus shipping the 100 gig transponders to your installed base? Daniel P. Kelly Yes, Simona, most of that, the strength that we saw in the first half of the year in Optical, we did add some new customers in the first half of the year. But most of that strength in Optical is in North America with existing customers continuing to expand, adding additional capabilities, bandwidth. Our system scales very nicely and cost-effectively for our customers. We try to -- we've architected the product to help our customers better match their investment versus the capabilities, to try to minimize some of those step functions. So a lot of it is just the growth in bandwidth and we're seeing the beginnings of the 100 gig. So the bigger factor would be the growth in systems and transponders, and then a subset of that would be the beginnings of what we think will be a multiyear trend towards rolling out 100 gig capabilities. Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Great. And then staying with Optical for 1 more question. Some of your smaller up and coming competitors like Scion [ph] and BTI [ph] are deploying some of these converged Packet Optical platforms in Web 2.0 types of customers as well. Are your products suitable for that customer base? And if so, are there any efforts underway to address it? Daniel P. Kelly So I believe our product is very flexible and has many of the capabilities that can address some of those markets and some of those capabilities. I'll tell you that, in many cases, our end customers use the 7100 to offer services to those end customers that would be deploying Web 2.0 type capabilities. We're continuing to develop and are always looking at new opportunities and new customers while we strengthen and expand with existing customers. Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay. And then you highlight that the small cell backhaul opportunity. When should we see that ramp both in terms of your product coming to market, but then also the broader market adoption of small cells? Daniel P. Kelly Okay. So the product availability will be early next year. We have been doing a lot of testing and we are competing at this point in a handful of our peers for our small cell backhaul solution. So what we provide is the intelligence and the capabilities, the network management solution that really can help our customers pull together that small cell solution. So they're certainly, early adopters that are pushing that technology now. I think we're still in the very early stages there. But we hope to see some customer traction and activity in 2014 with our 8602 small cell backhaul solution. Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Great. And then just last question. R&D, the cut there seems to have been pretty significant and deeper than the SG&A cuts. What areas are you cutting back in and how confident are you that you're not cutting into the bone at this point? Daniel P. Kelly Sure. So Simona, as we announced back in January, a lot of those R&D cuts were focused around the 9200 earlier in the year, which is part of our data portfolio and segment. As we announced in January, we're actually increasing some of the R&D spend in the Optical and a small amount in the Access area to help address the Optical LAN solution. So the short answer is, most of those cuts have been in our data segment as we focused and we're starting to look at investments beyond the current hedge router portfolio while we bring out additional feature packages. But the short answer is most of it was in the data segment. Operator Your next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS. Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division I guess my first question was just on the overall OpEx trend as well. Looks like you hit your guidance of mid-$70 million. I was just wondering from here, should we expect any further cuts or just stability in OpEx going forward? Daniel P. Kelly So Amitabh, we don't really guide beyond the current quarter. We're always looking for opportunities to take out OpEx without cutting to the bone, as Simona mentioned. We're only looking -- we only give guidance one quarter out but we're certainly looking beyond that. Larry and our finance team do a great job scouring every expense in the company and we're going to continue to do that, whether that's facility consolidation, subleasing space where we have it, we're very careful on CapEx. If you look year-over-year, from the first half of the year, how we're very careful on our CapEx spend. So I guess, Larry and his team leave no stone unturned there. I don't know if you want to give anymore color to the OpEx issue. Lawrence A. Rieger Well, I think that certainly, we brought it down from $80 million, and we expect it to be in the mid-$70 millions in the next quarter. We are watching it very closely. We spend a lot of time focused on it. I've been here 3 weeks, and I probably not made a lot of friends, as it relates to the operating expenses so far, but that's the way it's going to be. Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division And then Larry, I was wondering any help you can give us in terms of that cash flow outlook for next quarter, it looks like again we lost a bunch of cash from operations in this quarter. Lawrence A. Rieger Yes, I think that we've not guided on cash flow. And that's been the approach we've taken for competitive reasons. And so I really can't guide on that. Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Okay. Hey Dan, just a couple for you on the product side. On the Access side, I was just wondering what is your appetite in commitment to this segment? We're starting to hear what feels like a bit of a resurgence in broadband Access spending. A lot of noise around gigabit, opportunity surfacing. So I'm just wondering, particularly in the fiber-access business, are you happy just servicing your existing customer base or you're also pretty open to go after new opportunities? Daniel P. Kelly So we obviously want to take care of our current customers and do everything we can to help expand those networks and increase capabilities with our existing, I'd call more traditional broadband access customers. But the focus there has shifted over the past year or so. Focused more on the Optical LAN, building the ecosystem with people like CSC and others. So that's where we see an opportunity where we are really to market, we have a great solution and we have customers who we've got really good feedback from. So I would say our focus in the Access area, we are committed to the space, but with the focus with the Optical LAN application. Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Okay. I just have a couple more. On 100 gig, any update you can give us in terms of the competitive environment and pricing? Daniel P. Kelly Well, in the Optical space, as you all know, it's a very competitive market. And it always has been and will continue to be. And you have to be able to step up and compete in that competitive market, which we've done for many years and we're going to continue to do. So I would say pricing is always an issue and the way to play that game is, obviously you have to have an overall architecture in your solution that's cost effective. As I mentioned earlier, where you can really match your customers, investments and expenses with a very scalable solution, which we do have when we look at our nano shelf, our USS shelf and then we have a next generation shelf, that all operate under one software system. Having a very scalable solution there. So when we're going to this art[ph] piece, we're competing on everything. Whether it's future roadmap, whether it's pricing, whether it's network management as well. But the key also is you have to continue to invest and innovate. And if I look at some of our 10 gig transponders, which we've been selling for many, many years, you have to continually invest, driving all the cost out of there. Because it's a competitive market, customers expect costs to go down. And if you actually look at 10 gig trends, they've been very aggressive. And we've been able to stay ahead of that curve by continually cost reducing our transponder technology. Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division And just final one. On OTN switching, I think last quarter you talked about doing some lab tests. Just wanted to get an update in terms of, are you deploying product? What are you seeing in terms of the appetite in the market place for OTN switching combined on transport systems? Daniel P. Kelly Yes, so it's absolutely requirement for many parts of the market. We do have capabilities today and we're expanding our capabilities for OTN switching. And we have tested those capabilities with customers. Operator Your next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division I wanted to ask you about back to the 100 gig discussion. So was some of the strength that you experienced in the Optical business function of your delivery of 100 gig modules? Or was it just simply more broad based operators chasing balance growth? Daniel P. Kelly George, it's definitely the latter. It's broadband growth for video, wireless backhaul, for just general enterprise customer bandwidth. But the 100 gig is very important and we do have a great solution and it is being deployed by several of our customers. Now, we see that trend. We're at the very beginning of the 100 gig rollout in metro-regional networks and we expect that to continue for many years. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division When do you think the economics of 100 gig will start to really make sense in metro environment? Daniel P. Kelly I think that's starting now. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division I get the impression it would take still some time for many carriers with economics to be become interesting. You think that's turning right now? I mean, is this an inflection point you see in the metro that near term or? Daniel P. Kelly So it's starting now, but there are some carriers that will make that decision farther down the line. And will continue to innovate and cost reduce the 100 gig technology, working with suppliers to drive all the cost. And then it will prove in faster for other customers as we go down that curve. And I do expect that if you look at the 100 gig curve over time, that's dropped dramatically. Given the technology around the 100 gig, it's very early. But I do expect over time that we'll see a fairly aggressive cost curve, driven by OEM equipment, people like Tellabs, as well as our component suppliers driving out and innovating with new technology. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division And then, just as a bigger picture question. So when you sort of sit back and think about the business, I think someone else mentioned this earlier when you guys are obviously burning some cash here, you're open to drive towards breakeven in terms of profitability. You've got some more cost, it sounds like it's going to come out of the bit model in Q3. But relative to the set of opportunities you're chasing right now, Optical, Data, the Optical LAN stuff, do you think you have the right cost structure? Is there still some more cost structure that you need to take out to make the economics for the business make sense longer term? And what's the model you see going forward? And what kind of the decisions are you guys making in terms of driving interesting economics here? Daniel P. Kelly Yes. So obviously, profitability is very important. And we're not happy with the lack of that in the first half of the year, and we're working very hard on many fronts. One, obviously is on OpEx but it's not just cutting OpEx, it's also making sure that every dollar you spend from an R&D and a sales perspective is well spent. And that's why when we look at -- when we look out over the next few years, we're making decisions now on our portfolio and where we're spending our money, how we see our portfolio evolving. I talked a little bit about the Optical but we also see the data portfolio evolving as well. We're starting to invest in some of the SDN technologies and we have some proof of concepts with several very important customers later this year that we're pretty excited about. So I think we're always going to be driving down OpEx. Profitability is very important to our shareholders. That's what they expect, and that's what we have to deliver. While we're being very careful on every dollar we do spend, that it does have a return for our shareholders. Operator At this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks. Daniel P. Kelly Well, thank you, everyone. We've talked about a lot of things today but it all boils down to this. We're working hard to revitalize Tellabs, we're executing our strategy, creating paths to revenue growth and controlling expenses. These are the next steps on Tellab's road to profitability and growth. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call today and we'll see you in 90 days. Operator Thank you. This concludes the conference.

It stars some of the dynamics in the Optical area. We did add a few, 4 new customers in the Optical space. Obviously, we don't give detail around those 4 customers. But as you know, from winning these projects to deploying these projects, they do stretch over multiple years. And we have projects that started business we won 10 years ago that we're still selling transponders to. So it does take time, you have to go through certainly lab testing, field trials, et cetera. So when you win 4 customers in 1 quarter, the effect isn't immediate. It's really getting to the lab, getting through the operational support systems and rolling out the product. Some of the dynamics that we saw on the Optical space in the second -- actually first and second quarter, was strong demand in North America in the Optical space. And I know a lot of you guys have pointed that out, as well when you look at CapEx from the big carriers in North America. We see a lot of that driven by the video demand and video build out, as well as wireless traffic being carried over these networks. So that certainly 1 dynamic that we see, and I don't think that's going to go away. The other dynamic is, as we announced couple of our 100 gig customers, and again, where we really focus is not in the long-haul summary, we focus in the metro-regional space with the Tellabs 7100. And with the 7300, the ability to aggregate Ethernet traffic all the way out to the edge. So we're seeing 100 gig, obviously first in the long-haul networks, migrating in the demand there, in the metro-regional networks. And in my words a few minutes ago, CenturyLink, the task, a couple of our 100 gig customers, and we have many others and so I think we're just at the beginning of what is a very real beginning of 100 gig rollout in the metro-regional space. Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Okay. And then, Dan, could you -- one thing you guys said on the Access side of the business, the Optical LAN, it feels like the enterprise campus is really moving to Wi-Fi. And I'm surprised that you guys talking too much about Optical LAN. Can you expand on that a little bit, like what were the application before that? Are these specialized applications, just kind of how big is that market really? Daniel P. Kelly Right. So the size of the market, there's different ways to slice it and no analyst has really come out to give their slice of it. But if you actually look at the enterprise LAN market, it's obviously very, very big. Our focus is on subsegment of that. We don't address the entire market. But since it's such a large market, we do see some interesting opportunities there in the enterprise, we did announce new customer, Deltek in the second quarter. We've also added distributor CFC, part of WESCO. And we're doing more to build out that ecosystem because we do believe in the application. And we get that question a lot about Wi-Fi. And Wi-Fi from the endpoint makes sense, but you can still use the Optical LAN technology on a campus environment to provide a very low cost, high availability, high-bandwidth solution that can then be the backbone for campuses that do have Wi-Fi on the endpoint. So we do see that application as well. We also continue to see opportunities including what we announced earlier this morning, the Australian opportunity, the Department of Defence with Telstra, where we can bundle the Optical LAN with our BDM, ROADM technology into very high bandwidth campus environment. So we also see synergies across that as well. Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Okay. And then -- I just wanted to ask you on Access, I know you made some comments on your prepared remarks. But, I mean, that number -- pretty tough number in Access, is there anything to make you think that things are stabilizing there or likely to improve over the next couple of quarters, or? Daniel P. Kelly Yes, good question. The big downdraft in the second quarter around Access was due to the 1600 deal ONTs and they were much stronger in the first quarter than in the second quarter. But we do see signs of positive signs on the horizon for the 1600 revenue as we look farther out in time. Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division But can you elaborate on what those signs are? Daniel P. Kelly Not really. Operator Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division A handful of things I wanted to touch on. First one was, if you could talk a little bit about the drivers for the upside to gross margin in your June quarter, I presume it's somewhat mixed. But if you could drill down on that a little bit? Daniel P. Kelly Sure, Simon. Happy to do that. The big factor -- there was 2 factors, 1 bigger than the other. The one was, that I mentioned earlier when Rod asked this question was, the downdraft on the 1600. As you know, in ONT, in general, would be lower than corporate average margin. So when that volume drops, that helps us. As well as the strong optical revenue in the second quarter with a better mix around transponders, which have slightly better margin than the common equipment. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Great. Yes, I know and that's what I suspected, was the transponder mix actually. And that was really setting up for my next question is, what portion of your Optical segment sales are 100G today, and how do you see that trending overall? Daniel P. Kelly Yes, so Simon, we don't break out the 100 gig as a subsegment of our Optical segment. Where we're at and what we've announced is new customers rolling out and offering 100 gig services. We have customers in Latin America, we have customers in the EMEA region, and certainly in North America, which is probably leading the demand curve a little faster than some of the other markets. We see that continuing. I think we're at the beginning of what will be a multiyear rollout of 100 gig technology with -- on the Tellabs 7100. And as you know, our platform can support 10, 40 and 100 gig, we've done a lot of engineering work on top of that. So I think we're at the very beginning of what will be a multiyear rollout of 100 gig. We're also investing in and working on 400 gig technology, as well as our next generation, 7100 shelf, which will provide capabilities well beyond into the far future there to support 100 gig and beyond services off that shelf, that can operate within our current 7100 infrastructure. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division So when you were thinking about your guidance for the September quarter, it looks like you're expecting similar to maybe slightly lower gross margin. I'm assuming that what's implied in that forecast might be a little bit of recovery in your Access business, but generally flat sequential terms by segment. It's -- or similar mix, is that fair? Daniel P. Kelly Yes, I think it's probably customer mix comes into play as well, Simon. There, when I looked Q2 to Q3, obviously we try to do everything we can to give you accurate guidance. But also work very hard pushing down OpEx and working hard to increase gross margins, as well as we move throughout the quarter. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division And then just maybe one last one, and I'd like to frame this in really a longer term strategic question. But looking at the international sales on a year-over-year basis, down over 40%. You had a tremendous growth rate, I guess, in 2012 or so on international and now looks like you're facing pretty tough comparisons. What are you doing in terms of trying to turn your year-over-years around other than getting easier comparisons? How are you going to get growth back in the international market? Daniel P. Kelly Right. So a lot of that downdraft, in fact, I would say, you'd probably have to go back to 2011, Simon, because we're certainly seeing the downdraft in the Europe, Western Europe in particular, in the back half of the year. And as we discussed on previous calls that, that did hurt us, there was a downdraft. And a lot of our Europe revenue is with our Data products. It's not that we were losing market share, a lot of it was based on our customer spend in that area. And the downdraft, I would say, began 1 year ago and continues. So what are we doing about it? We're focusing on winning new business like we have in Australia, we're working hard on adding Optical customers in Europe, Middle East and Africa, adding partnerships. We announced a partnership in Italy last quarter as well for our Optical products. So we're not resting. We're moving forward. We're continuing to develop future packages for our customers to upgrade their networks on our data networks, adding and expanding our ecosystem around our Optical business in those markets. And we've also had some challenges in Latin America from a regulation perspective in Mexico, but we're working hard to turn that around and we do see some positive signs on the horizon in Mexico and Latin America. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Great. Appreciate it. And any color you can give us on 10% customers in the quarter? Lawrence A. Rieger Yes, this is Larry, Simon. And we had a 2 10% customers in the quarter. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division North America, international, where were they? Lawrence A. Rieger Sorry, for competitive reasons, we can't talk about that. Operator Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division I wanted to come back to the strength you saw in the Optical segment. Are you able to determine how much of that is based on market share gains for you guys? For example, like expanding your own footprint versus shipping the 100 gig transponders to your installed base? Daniel P. Kelly Yes, Simona, most of that, the strength that we saw in the first half of the year in Optical, we did add some new customers in the first half of the year. But most of that strength in Optical is in North America with existing customers continuing to expand, adding additional capabilities, bandwidth. Our system scales very nicely and cost-effectively for our customers. We try to -- we've architected the product to help our customers better match their investment versus the capabilities, to try to minimize some of those step functions. So a lot of it is just the growth in bandwidth and we're seeing the beginnings of the 100 gig. So the bigger factor would be the growth in systems and transponders, and then a subset of that would be the beginnings of what we think will be a multiyear trend towards rolling out 100 gig capabilities. Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Great. And then staying with Optical for 1 more question. Some of your smaller up and coming competitors like Scion [ph] and BTI [ph] are deploying some of these converged Packet Optical platforms in Web 2.0 types of customers as well. Are your products suitable for that customer base? And if so, are there any efforts underway to address it? Daniel P. Kelly So I believe our product is very flexible and has many of the capabilities that can address some of those markets and some of those capabilities. I'll tell you that, in many cases, our end customers use the 7100 to offer services to those end customers that would be deploying Web 2.0 type capabilities. We're continuing to develop and are always looking at new opportunities and new customers while we strengthen and expand with existing customers. Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay. And then you highlight that the small cell backhaul opportunity. When should we see that ramp both in terms of your product coming to market, but then also the broader market adoption of small cells? Daniel P. Kelly Okay. So the product availability will be early next year. We have been doing a lot of testing and we are competing at this point in a handful of our peers for our small cell backhaul solution. So what we provide is the intelligence and the capabilities, the network management solution that really can help our customers pull together that small cell solution. So they're certainly, early adopters that are pushing that technology now. I think we're still in the very early stages there. But we hope to see some customer traction and activity in 2014 with our 8602 small cell backhaul solution. Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Great. And then just last question. R&D, the cut there seems to have been pretty significant and deeper than the SG&A cuts. What areas are you cutting back in and how confident are you that you're not cutting into the bone at this point? Daniel P. Kelly Sure. So Simona, as we announced back in January, a lot of those R&D cuts were focused around the 9200 earlier in the year, which is part of our data portfolio and segment. As we announced in January, we're actually increasing some of the R&D spend in the Optical and a small amount in the Access area to help address the Optical LAN solution. So the short answer is, most of those cuts have been in our data segment as we focused and we're starting to look at investments beyond the current hedge router portfolio while we bring out additional feature packages. But the short answer is most of it was in the data segment. Operator Your next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS. Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division I guess my first question was just on the overall OpEx trend as well. Looks like you hit your guidance of mid-$70 million. I was just wondering from here, should we expect any further cuts or just stability in OpEx going forward? Daniel P. Kelly So Amitabh, we don't really guide beyond the current quarter. We're always looking for opportunities to take out OpEx without cutting to the bone, as Simona mentioned. We're only looking -- we only give guidance one quarter out but we're certainly looking beyond that. Larry and our finance team do a great job scouring every expense in the company and we're going to continue to do that, whether that's facility consolidation, subleasing space where we have it, we're very careful on CapEx. If you look year-over-year, from the first half of the year, how we're very careful on our CapEx spend. So I guess, Larry and his team leave no stone unturned there. I don't know if you want to give anymore color to the OpEx issue. Lawrence A. Rieger Well, I think that certainly, we brought it down from $80 million, and we expect it to be in the mid-$70 millions in the next quarter. We are watching it very closely. We spend a lot of time focused on it. I've been here 3 weeks, and I probably not made a lot of friends, as it relates to the operating expenses so far, but that's the way it's going to be. Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division And then Larry, I was wondering any help you can give us in terms of that cash flow outlook for next quarter, it looks like again we lost a bunch of cash from operations in this quarter. Lawrence A. Rieger Yes, I think that we've not guided on cash flow. And that's been the approach we've taken for competitive reasons. And so I really can't guide on that. Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Okay. Hey Dan, just a couple for you on the product side. On the Access side, I was just wondering what is your appetite in commitment to this segment? We're starting to hear what feels like a bit of a resurgence in broadband Access spending. A lot of noise around gigabit, opportunity surfacing. So I'm just wondering, particularly in the fiber-access business, are you happy just servicing your existing customer base or you're also pretty open to go after new opportunities? Daniel P. Kelly So we obviously want to take care of our current customers and do everything we can to help expand those networks and increase capabilities with our existing, I'd call more traditional broadband access customers. But the focus there has shifted over the past year or so. Focused more on the Optical LAN, building the ecosystem with people like CSC and others. So that's where we see an opportunity where we are really to market, we have a great solution and we have customers who we've got really good feedback from. So I would say our focus in the Access area, we are committed to the space, but with the focus with the Optical LAN application. Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Okay. I just have a couple more. On 100 gig, any update you can give us in terms of the competitive environment and pricing? Daniel P. Kelly Well, in the Optical space, as you all know, it's a very competitive market. And it always has been and will continue to be. And you have to be able to step up and compete in that competitive market, which we've done for many years and we're going to continue to do. So I would say pricing is always an issue and the way to play that game is, obviously you have to have an overall architecture in your solution that's cost effective. As I mentioned earlier, where you can really match your customers, investments and expenses with a very scalable solution, which we do have when we look at our nano shelf, our USS shelf and then we have a next generation shelf, that all operate under one software system. Having a very scalable solution there. So when we're going to this art[ph] piece, we're competing on everything. Whether it's future roadmap, whether it's pricing, whether it's network management as well. But the key also is you have to continue to invest and innovate. And if I look at some of our 10 gig transponders, which we've been selling for many, many years, you have to continually invest, driving all the cost out of there. Because it's a competitive market, customers expect costs to go down. And if you actually look at 10 gig trends, they've been very aggressive. And we've been able to stay ahead of that curve by continually cost reducing our transponder technology. Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division And just final one. On OTN switching, I think last quarter you talked about doing some lab tests. Just wanted to get an update in terms of, are you deploying product? What are you seeing in terms of the appetite in the market place for OTN switching combined on transport systems? Daniel P. Kelly Yes, so it's absolutely requirement for many parts of the market. We do have capabilities today and we're expanding our capabilities for OTN switching. And we have tested those capabilities with customers. Operator Your next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division I wanted to ask you about back to the 100 gig discussion. So was some of the strength that you experienced in the Optical business function of your delivery of 100 gig modules? Or was it just simply more broad based operators chasing balance growth? Daniel P. Kelly George, it's definitely the latter. It's broadband growth for video, wireless backhaul, for just general enterprise customer bandwidth. But the 100 gig is very important and we do have a great solution and it is being deployed by several of our customers. Now, we see that trend. We're at the very beginning of the 100 gig rollout in metro-regional networks and we expect that to continue for many years. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division When do you think the economics of 100 gig will start to really make sense in metro environment? Daniel P. Kelly I think that's starting now. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division I get the impression it would take still some time for many carriers with economics to be become interesting. You think that's turning right now? I mean, is this an inflection point you see in the metro that near term or? Daniel P. Kelly So it's starting now, but there are some carriers that will make that decision farther down the line. And will continue to innovate and cost reduce the 100 gig technology, working with suppliers to drive all the cost. And then it will prove in faster for other customers as we go down that curve. And I do expect that if you look at the 100 gig curve over time, that's dropped dramatically. Given the technology around the 100 gig, it's very early. But I do expect over time that we'll see a fairly aggressive cost curve, driven by OEM equipment, people like Tellabs, as well as our component suppliers driving out and innovating with new technology. George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division And then, just as a bigger picture question. So when you sort of sit back and think about the business, I think someone else mentioned this earlier when you guys are obviously burning some cash here, you're open to drive towards breakeven in terms of profitability. You've got some more cost, it sounds like it's going to come out of the bit model in Q3. But relative to the set of opportunities you're chasing right now, Optical, Data, the Optical LAN stuff, do you think you have the right cost structure? Is there still some more cost structure that you need to take out to make the economics for the business make sense longer term? And what's the model you see going forward? And what kind of the decisions are you guys making in terms of driving interesting economics here? Daniel P. Kelly Yes. So obviously, profitability is very important. And we're not happy with the lack of that in the first half of the year, and we're working very hard on many fronts. One, obviously is on OpEx but it's not just cutting OpEx, it's also making sure that every dollar you spend from an R&D and a sales perspective is well spent. And that's why when we look at -- when we look out over the next few years, we're making decisions now on our portfolio and where we're spending our money, how we see our portfolio evolving. I talked a little bit about the Optical but we also see the data portfolio evolving as well. We're starting to invest in some of the SDN technologies and we have some proof of concepts with several very important customers later this year that we're pretty excited about. So I think we're always going to be driving down OpEx. Profitability is very important to our shareholders. That's what they expect, and that's what we have to deliver. While we're being very careful on every dollar we do spend, that it does have a return for our shareholders. Operator At this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks. Daniel P. Kelly Well, thank you, everyone. We've talked about a lot of things today but it all boils down to this. We're working hard to revitalize Tellabs, we're executing our strategy, creating paths to revenue growth and controlling expenses. These are the next steps on Tellab's road to profitability and growth. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call today and we'll see you in 90 days. Operator Thank you. This concludes the conference.

Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Operator Good morning and welcome to the TripAdvisor\'s First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\'s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to TripAdvisor\'s Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Will Lyons. Please go ahead. Will Lyons - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Steve Kaufer, our CEO, and Ernst Teunissen, our CFO. Last night, after market close, we distributed and filed our Q1 earnings release. We filed our 10-Q, and we made available our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website, located at ir.tripadvisor.com. In the release, you will find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. Also, our IR site contains a supplemental file information document, which includes certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call as well as other performance metrics. Instead of reading our prepared remarks on this call, Steve will jump into a couple of thoughts, and then we\'ll jump right into Q&A. Before we begin, I\'d like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent the company\'s view as of today, May 10, 2017. TripAdvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Please refer to our earnings release and our filings with the SEC for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. And, with that, I\'ll pass the call over to Steve. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thank you, Will, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Hopefully, you\'ve had a chance to read our prepared remarks that we published last night after market close. I\'ll summarize by saying 2017 is off to a productive start. In Hotels, we\'re rapidly aligning products, supply and marketing, as we drive towards long-term growth and profitability. In a few weeks, we will rollout our streamlined hotel shopping experience and, soon thereafter, we\'ll launch our new brand advertising campaign, leveraging our strong global brand to build user awareness at TripAdvisor as a great place to find the lowest prices when you are ready to book. In Non-Hotels, our continued strong demand growth and supply investments are really starting to pay off. And while focus remains on top-line growth, this segment is already beginning to exhibit attractive profit potential. We are addressing large growth opportunities ahead and making great progress building end-to-end products that travelers love, a bigger and better platform for advertisers and a bigger and better business over the long term. Ernst? Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We saw strong growth recovery, as the first quarter consolidated total revenue growth improved to 6% year-over-year, or 7% in constant currency. This revenue growth also improved from our fourth quarter results, driven by improvements in our TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction business. We are encouraged by the significant recovery we saw in this click-based and transaction revenue growth over the past few quarters and the continued strong growth of our Non-Hotel segment. Notably, we reiterate our revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook, now inclusive of our brand advertising investment. We are able to maintain this outlook by re-allocating some less-efficient online marketing dollars, as well as expected profit favorability in our Non-Hotel segment towards our brand advertising. With that, we\'ll now open the call for your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks guys. Nice job on the quarter. Steve, I guess, the first question is just can we get a little more color on what\'s driving the improvement in revenue per shopper in the U.S. market? Is it coverage? Is it better competition in the auction? Any color there would be helpful. And then, can you also talk about overall engagement? As you\'ve been making these changes to the mobile experience and as you see hotel shopper growth pick back up, what\'s happening with engagement, meaning is session frequency or visits per hotel shopper also going up? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Sure. So with regard to our revenue per shopper growth in the U.S., the biggest factor is certainly going to be the lapping of instant book. We have made a big bet in that category, built a really nice product. But it did have some dilutive effects. So now, we\'re at a really good spot where we have turned the team towards the regular optimization efforts that we normally go through and we\'re seeing results. Simultaneously as we indicated, we are working on our new shopping experience. And any time that we focus on delivering a better overall experience, we would look to one of the measurements being an increased revenue per shopper. When it comes to mobile, we\'ve certainly seen meaningful growth aligned with the industry as users tip over to be using mobile apps and web. And we\'ve seen, on our own side, an improved revenue per session from users using our mobile app. I don\'t have specific numbers I can share in terms of increased engagement to your specific question, but suffice to say, more and more users, more and more of the time, are using our apps for, not only hotel shopping, but the full trip. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc. Great. If I can ask one more follow-up for Ernst on the Non-Hotel segment, so you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you expect positive EBITDA for 2017. So can you talk about like where that margin might be exiting 2017 and remind us again what the longer-term margin profile for Non-Hotel looks like? Thank you. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yeah. We\'ve always described this as a multi-year process, in which we would initially invest in the Non-Hotel segment and then gradually turn it to profitability, as we saw more scale in the business. We\'ve been focused on building scale. This is the year where we\'re seeing some of that building scale come to fruition in terms of leverage on the bottom line. And, as we say, we expect this Non-Hotel segment in aggregate to be EBITDA positive, which we think is a great mid-point in our journey. As we go forward, we expect our margins in the longer run to be robust and attractive. We\'re not managing to a particular margin. We continue to see this business as a growth and investment business. But this year, we are going to see that profitability come through and a little faster than we even thought three months ago. The first quarter has seen very robust results on the top-line versus our expectations, but also on the bottom-line versus our expectation. We\'re seeing some efficiencies come through in this business. So, positive EBITDA for the year and a strong outlook for the future. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. To add just a tiny bit of additional color to that, we\'re pleased to note that in our attractions business, specifically the TripAdvisor as the demand channel, is growing faster than we had anticipated. And that was, of course, one of the big pieces of synergy that we were looking for when picking up the Viator business and all of that supply, how do we better monetize all of the demand that\'s already sitting on TripAdvisor? And so on the TripPlatform, the demand continues to grow quite quickly, and we\'re able to merchandise it better, having all the great Viator supply at our fingertips. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two also around the marketing theme. In decommissioning inefficient spend and redeploying that money into brand advertising, I\'m curious what you think that does for a return on your marketing dollars long term for the business. That will be number one. And number two, as you do sort of decommission inefficient spend and redeploy it into brand, anything we should be aware of in the quarter-to-quarter cadence of marketing that might buck some of the usual seasonality trends of marketing. Thanks so much for the color. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thank you, Eric. In terms of the long-term efficiency profile of our paid-marketing spend, we expect from TV to create much more lifetime value of users that we acquire and influence from TV than we are going to be able to get with online marketing. And so with our online marketing, we have managed to, pretty short-term, roughly breakeven as a channel, the ongoing benefit is more limited and difficult to prove. With TV, with a real shift of brand perception as TripAdvisor from a place just to use for planning, to use for planning plus price comparison and booking, we can get much more lasting impact on our user group. And therefore, over time, that should actually benefit our marketing efficiency profile. In terms of the seasonality of marketing spend cadence, not so much. I mean the marketing will still be aligned very much to the seasonality of the business, which doesn\'t change by doing advertising. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you. I had two questions somewhat related, it kind of has to do with the near-term risks. You\'re going to be reallocating a pretty significant amount of your online marketing spend, how confident are you that you kind of have your head around the negative impact that that\'s going to have to the top-line, at least in the near term? And then you will be changing your UI, it sounds like as well, how confident are you around modeling the short-term potential negative impacts? And I guess, the question there will be, also what do you see as some of the near-term potential negative impacts from the UI change? Thanks. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Okay. This is Ernst. I\'ll take the first question on the marketing, and Steve will take the product question. It is true that if we reallocate marketing dollars from online to TV is you get a positive impact in revenue on TV and potentially a negative impact on online. We have done quite a bit of work over the last three months in studying the different markets that we\'re going to go in with TV, studying our historical patterns of impact of TV that we have found. And although there is some volatility around the results there, we feel good about the projections that we are making and good about reiterating this double-digit growth this year on our transaction-based business for TripAdvisor. Steve you got... Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes. And with regard to the user interface, we are fortunate that this is the type of change that\'s mostly internal to TripAdvisor. It\'s not requiring a lot of assistance or behavior change on the part of our clients. So, we\'re in control over the testing methodology, the roll-out. You can see some of the changes already on the site, some of the changes already on the app, basically depending, if you get lucky enough to see it. But all of that goes into our testing and how we are able to gain confidence that is in fact revenue neutral or revenue positive, as we move to roll-out. I\'m not saying we wouldn\'t roll out completely if we were up or down by a little bit, but we do have a lot of capabilities and are experiencing this day-to-day in tuning and tweaking the design so that it delivers on not only a better experience, but the revenue expectations that we have in our plan. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thanks. In the script, you guys mentioned that absolute U.S. revenue per hotel shopper has fully recovered to levels to prior to instant book launch. It looked like by our math that the desktop rev per shopper still about 20% off the highs. Is the delta just international, and is that following a similar path to the U.S. in terms of improvement? And then just following up on some of the TV questions, it\'s always a challenge to change user behavior. And you guys have been working at it on the IP side. I guess what is it about the new campaign and/or the new page that makes you feel more confident you can really get users to come back closer to time of purchase? Is there anything just from the tests you\'ve seen in the new page design that gives you that incremental confidence? Thanks. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Lloyd, I\'ll take the first one, and Steve will take the second. The comment about RPS being back to 2014 levels, pertain to the U.S. and so we have seen that in the U.S. Internationally, we have not yet seen that. And so that was a clarification I want to make on that point. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. And in terms of TV changing behavior, there are many examples out there where a brand in a category comes up with, you could call it, line extension if you want. So, we all think back to Amazon that started at books and now did books and music, and books, music and of course, now they do everything, and they were able to do that because they have positioned themselves as a shopping site. Well, TripAdvisor is a travel site. You come to plan your trip. So, we have the credibility to be able to play in a number of different aspects in that travel planning, but we wouldn\'t be able to sell you a pair of shoes, that\'s kind of not what people associate TripAdvisor. So we come from a strength, reviews, as Amazon had come from a strength, books, but it\'s well within what users are using the site for to extend it to something else, and in our case, moving into that price comparison. So, we have a large portion of our current audience and have, for the past decade, come to TripAdvisor, read reviews and move into our price comparison engine and then click off to our partners or use instant book to book. So that\'s an already established behavior pattern for a large portion of our users. Our challenge isn\'t, hey, is that even possible? Will users do that sort of thing? They do. It\'s a huge business for us. The question is, can a TV campaign accelerate the move of the people who don\'t currently use us for that to join sort of the crowd that does. And a lot of people, when we ask will say, well, yes, I use it for reviews. I didn\'t know that you have price comparison. And, of course, I hear that and I think, how could you miss that on our site? Oh my goodness, it\'s plastered all over the place. But you have to accept what users are telling you. When we go on TV and we talk very clearly about price comparison, find the lowest price, help save you some money as a traveler. And we repeat that on the TV ad numerous times, we hope to educate that individual that the site that they already know and love can now be used for this new part of the hotel shopping experience, which they are already on TripAdvisor for. So we don\'t view it as a big leap or a big change. And when we looked at our last TV campaign, it was focused less around the benefit of comparing prices and more teaching about teaching users specifically that they can now book on TripAdvisor. So we\'ve tweaked that message. We\'ll be back out to the marketplace at a heavier weight with a more streamlined user experience that\'s focused around that hotel shopping. Think of it as less distractions on the page, more point how can we help you save some money in your shopping experience, how can we give you the best value for the hotel that you\'re looking for, not just the highest rated, but the best rated in your price point, those sorts of things. And we\'re giving ourselves time to make that message sink in through things like TV and our other online campaigns. So, I view our past TV as very instructive useful lessons to get us to where we are now, but we have a very compelling plan to achieve these objectives that we have in front of us now. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Makes sense. Thanks a lot, Steve. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Please proceed. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you very much. Steve, I know in the past you\'ve often referred to TripAdvisor as being indifferent between meta and instant booking. With the new hotel shopping experience rolling out, could you just characterize what if anything has changed within there? And then, secondly, one for Ernst. On click-based transaction revenue, you mentioned that international growth rates are still significantly lagging due to the constant currency. You obviously had a very strong quarter with the U.S. How should we think about the cadence of improvement in that international growth rate? And is there any reason that that should improve at a different rate than the U.S.? Thank you. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Great. Justin, I\'ll take the first part. So we look at meta and IB as two different methods to allow the user to find and book the hotel that they want. They are on our site. They\'re getting the best value that they can in the sort. They\'re looking at the photos, reading the reviews, building the confidence that they are getting the right spot, the right hotel. Now, the next thing the consumer absolutely needs is to get the best deal on that hotel. And so part of the new shopping experience helps pull people down that funnel of putting in your dates and actually getting to see our prices, and noting that we\'ve scoured the web and found you a great price. The thing that\'s not new in this quarter or in this redesign is where instant book fits into that mix, because we have been talking for several quarters about instant booking earning its position in our hotel shopping experience so that we put it in front of users when we think they are most likely to use it, either for price, because instant book might have the best price or convenience, particularly on the phone, if it\'s something you\'ve used before. So, we want to build that great shopping experience. Instant booking is a clear tool that help us do that and is a way that we can get better pricing in front of our consumers and make it more convenient, especially on the phone. But as we look forward in 2017-2018, if instant book, if as some people come to think, well, instant book is not as prominent as it once was, and that\'s because our customers are telling us they are indifferent as to whether they are choosing to use it versus something else, and that\'s okay with us, hence the comment on indifferent. We want to do what\'s best for our travelers, and we believe instant book plays a key role in that, though not as big a role as we had anticipated a couple of years ago. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. And then, Justin, your question about the click-based revenue and the international component of that. So, the U.S. is roughly half of our revenues and the other half is outside of the U.S. The UK is our largest market, but it\'s a long tail of many, many markets internationally. Part of the differential in growth rates is attributable to timing in IB and lapping of IB, but that\'s not the full story. Currency is one of the factors, if you compare, for instance, the pound, the UK being our largest non-U.S. market a year ago versus today. And then the mobile shift has tended to happen faster outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. And then there are many market-by-market differences. But generally, the overall market, the robustness of our auction, the level of competition is more favorable in the U.S. than in many places outside of the U.S. And so our anticipation is that the U.S. will remain the pace car in terms of growth in the foreseeable future that we believe that in the long-term, international markets can be robust growers for us. Two, that the pattern of growth recovery is likely to be a little slower than we\'ve seen in the U.S. and therefore, lag the U.S. more than just the lagging of the IB roll-out. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Got it. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hey. Good morning. I have two questions please. First, how much of the ability to maintain your EBITDA guidance for the year is a result of the reallocation of marketing funds versus the better profitability in the Non-Hotel segment? I\'d assume it\'s nearly all the reallocation of marketing dollars. But, first of all, is that correct? And then, second, I guess, following the previous question, assuming IB continues to be less of a focus, how do you envision navigating the challenge of the handoff problem for mobile that IB was meant to help or is that handoff, for instance, maybe just not a significant of an issue as you previously perceived it to be as you see the mobile mix grow? Thanks. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thank you, Mike. We\'re not breaking down in more detail where the EBITDA favorability comes from to offset the TV unfavorability. But we called out these two factors for a reason. They are both meaningful contributors to that. And so it\'s not only one or the other, we called these two out because they are both relevant. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. And with respect to instant book on the phone, if you look back, I keep talking about building the great shopping experience for hotel shoppers on the phone. And there is a click-off model that works quite well for us and others. But there\'s certainly a wonderful convenience of being able to essentially buy it with a single click, as sites like Amazon have shown. We don\'t see a reason why we won\'t be able to get there in the Hotel space. And to do that, you need something that kind of looks like instant book or something pretty close. So, if we fast-forward to the time when instant book really does have the best pricing available on the web, it\'s kind of matched the lowest price from anywhere, there is going to be in our prediction a set of travelers who love the TripAdvisor hotel shopping experience, have put in their credit cards and have now formed a habit, where they are a frequent repeat user of our app, because it\'s just simpler and you always get the lowest price. We\'re not forcing that on people, to be clear right now, but we see that as a wonderful endgame as the world moves to mobile. And if you\'re using us for price comparison, there isn\'t an obvious benefit of clicking out versus continuing your purchase on our site, unless someone else gives you the better price. And that\'s the challenge for the instant book team is always making sure that piece of the product has the best price. When we do that, we\'ll earn more than our fair share, more convenience. Where we don\'t, our business funnel says, will help the customer save the dollar by clicking them off to whoever does have the lowest price. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Can you provide any more color on the recently announced Grubhub deal? How broadly will it be rolled out on TripAdvisor? How will it be promoted? And how should we think about the revenue opportunity longer term? Thank you. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Sure. So as you know, we have a massive number of restaurants on the site globally. And folks, when they are looking for that place to eat, sometimes want to make a reservation, if it\'s a restaurant that takes reservations electronically, often want to read the reviews, look at the photos and sometimes want to do take-out, order the food delivery. Grubhub is a great partner. It covers many cities, certainly not all cities in the world, and presuming that works well for us, you\'d expect to see additional food delivery platforms coming online. I\'d caution against viewing that as a move-the-needle revenue opportunity for us as our traffic certainly tends to be a reasonable mix of tourists and locals, and tourists are going to be less likely to use a food delivery service, but based upon the scale of our restaurant space, it\'s kind of yet another product in the mix. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Please proceed. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC Hi. Thanks a lot. Could you give us any color on what you were seeing in April, especially with the Easter timing comp? And then on that, you also advised against extrapolating Q1 RPS growth into Q2. Can you give any more color on why you\'re more cautious on that? Thanks. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes. Thanks, Kevin. In our prepared remarks, we didn\'t call out any specific comments about April, but we did comment more broadly about extrapolation from Q1 into Q2 as you point out. And we caution against extrapolating some of the graphs that we put into our prepared remarks into Q2. Q1, as we said in the prepared remarks as well, was a quarter where the year-on-year comps for our paid marketing investment were relatively favorable. So we saw an ability to significantly grow our paid revenue line in Q1, which may not translate directly into Q2. And I\'ll make the point more generally, as some of these graphs that we put in, RPS and shoppers, if you look at the last few quarters, you could be tempted just to draw a straight line through some of those curves, and I just want to make sure of that. Although we have reiterated our expectation that we\'ll have double-digit growth in the click-based line this year and we feel very good about where we are and we feel good about our outlook there, the quarter-to-quarter progression may be not as smooth as some of the graphs have shown so far. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC Okay. Thanks, Ernst. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Please proceed. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks for taking my question. On capital allocation, you continue to churn out a decent amount of free cash flow and had a second consecutive quarter of decent buyback activity. Can you share how you\'re managing buybacks versus acquisitions versus investing for growth just given your comments around the long-term outlook for the business and where the stock is currently trading, would it make sense to be even more aggressive around the buybacks? Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thanks for the question, Jed. Indeed, we put $150 million to work in Q1 for share repurchases at an average price of $42.49. And I also want to underline what you said in your opening statement is that we are indeed generating significant cash flows just from operations. As we think about allocation, the areas of where we could invest outside of the business, outside the operations of the business is M&A, as evidenced in the last few years, in acquisitions that we\'ve made like Viator, like the TheFork, LaFourchette, last year we made a number of smaller investments but a number of investments there as well. And we\'ll continue to look at opportunities that may present itself in the M&A space. And then there\'s share repurchase as an opportunity as well. And as you say, we clearly, in 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017, have seen an opportunity to buy back some of our shares. The program is reviewed by the board from time to time. In January, the board approved refreshing the $250 million allocation that we had for share repurchases. And we have a 10b5 program in place with different triggers that we don\'t want to go into detail but they resulted in that purchase in Q1 and from time to time will allow us to benefit from periods where we believe our share price is attractive as an acquisition of ourselves, of our own stock. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. Can you guys help us understand how much of the recovery and a return to the pre-IB monetization levels that you\'re seeing in the U.S. is coming from optimizing on instant book versus shifting back to meta? And then also just wanted to follow up on mobile. Can you just talk about what the mobile to desktop monetization gap is here currently and your comments on extrapolating the same rationale, Ernst, that you mentioned a few minutes ago? Thanks. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes. So the U.S., I think it\'s a little bit difficult to untangle after so many years of how much of the RPS is this or the other. I do want to comment is we\'ve made continuous improvements on our revenue per shopper on desktop and in mobile. And in the U.S., we have been able to do that, and we\'ve been making continuous improvements on instant booking. We said a few quarters ago already that in the U.S. Instant booking was no longer dilutive to the overall offering, and we\'ve been improving both meta and IB since then. So I think it\'s a combination of factors, but it\'s just a sign that after fully incorporating instant booking in the U.S. now we\'re now better off than we were in 2014 and continue to show impressive growth to our revenue per shopper. In terms of the desktop monetization gap, we\'ve said in the past, if mobile monetizes roughly at one-third of desktop and those trends change a little quarter-over-quarter but not dramatically. We saw a quarter in the first quarter where there was revenue per shopper improvement on mobile. We had about 35% growth of our phone revenues and about 25% growth on the shopper line. And so we\'re very pleased with that, and we continue to sort of plug away making sure that we make that gap as small as we can. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thank you, Ernst. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. And then in terms of your last questions about the Q2, yeah, again, with mobile as with the general comments I was making quarter to quarter, there may be some volatility in revenue per shopper or in monetization of mobile, but the long-term trend is pretty stable. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Daniel Powell - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi. Thanks. This is Daniel Powell on for Heath. Just a couple quick ones from us. First, on the traffic growth and comments you\'ve made around paid acquisition, just curious if you could give any comments on what you\'re actually seeing in organic search and how much of that is coloring your decision to lean more into paid acquisition. And then on the Non-Hotel side, I just want to make sure we\'re interpreting your comments there correctly about it approaching 2016 growth levels, maybe suggesting an acceleration in the back half of the year against some tougher comps. Is that driven by seasonality mostly or is there something else that\'s changed in the business? Thanks. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thanks, Daniel, for the question. This is Steve. So I wouldn\'t say there is anything particularly different in our organic search trends. Google continues to take more space on search result pages on all devices for their own products and for other paid ads. There is nothing new in that statement. I\'ve been saying something like it for several years now. When we look at our overall marketing mix, we have more and more sort of brand traffic, we have paid traffic, we have organic traffic, we have our CRM program, and our focus at this point is on building what we call that branded direct traffic focused with a offline TV campaign in order to build more brand-direct, build more loyalty to Trip when a user is in mind for shopping. So I wouldn\'t say that shift is not a result of any specific organic search trend, but it is a change for us and we view a pretty meaningful one in terms of building the business for the long-term on a large component of brand-direct channels. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. In terms of the Non-Hotel, it is indeed a very seasonal business and even the growth is somewhat seasonal. Last year in the first quarter, we posted from memory I believe 14% growth for Non-Hotel, which was substantially lower than the rest of the year. And indeed, we said in our prepared remarks that we expect for the full year Non-Hotel growth will be approaching the levels that we had for the full year of last year. So implied in that indeed is that we expect growth to be better in the rest of the year than the first quarter. Other than underlying some of the seasonality we\'ve seen in vacation rentals, for instance, a continued shift to a free-to-list model, which means we get paid on booking, which tends to happen in the summer rather than at the time of – at done stay, sorry, rather than at the time of booking. And then there\'s some currency issues in there again on Vacation Rentals but also our Attractions business are, for a large part, pound driven and, of course, we had Brexit in the adjustment to the pound happening in the second quarter of last year. So, all in all, a number of factors why we believe Q1 should be a lower point compared to the full year in terms of Non-Hotel growth. Daniel Powell - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Nat Schindler with Bank of America. Please proceed. Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yes, hi, Ernst, just wanted to go over in little more detail on the guidance and/or your profit outlook comments. You said you can maintain profit outlook comments, but at this point, your profit outlook comments are simply flat to down. So that, quite frankly, an infinite range. So if I look at ROI as negative on the brand campaign, I know you\'re switching out some inefficient marketing dollars to pay for that but there would be some revenue lift from that brand campaign as well. How much are you really thinking this hits on the negative line or are you saying that this has no impact from where you were thinking last quarter? Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes, Nat. Thanks for that question. We said last quarter, we said flat to down and you are right, that we didn\'t specify what down really could imply. What we really wanted to signal in this quarter is that that outlook has not changed because of TV and that effectively, the negative impact on EBITDA we expect from TV. You said it\'s ROI negative, we believe it\'s ROI negative in the near term. In the long term, we think it\'s very much ROI positive, but we\'ll have a near-term drag on EBITDA, just the TV campaign itself, which is offset by these two drivers that I talked about, partly by reallocating some of our online spend. So we\'ve looked at our total portfolio of advertising spend and said TV doesn\'t necessarily have to be just a bolt-on. We have looked at what does that mean for our online, and we have been allocating some expendables on the margin less efficient than the average and allocated that towards TV. And then as we highlighted, we have upgraded our outlook on profitability of our Non-Hotel segment. And those two factors together for 2017 happen to be roughly equivalent to the EBITDA loss that we expect from the TV campaign. So taken together do not have a meaningful impact on where we thought the business would be three months ago without this brand advertising campaign. And, therefore, we are reiterating the same guidance flat to down that we did a quarter ago. Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. And just one secondary question on this, because this is happening fairly late in the year, I\'m assuming that the $70 million to $80 million is smaller than you would do next year and the years after. And you mentioned a few years. This campaign will continue for at least a few years. Can you give us any color on what you think a normalized year on this campaign will be? And then just on another corollary to this brand campaign, you pulled back after the 2014 and 2015 campaigns. You pulled back on those campaigns because they didn\'t work as well as you hoped. What makes you think that this time TV will work better? Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes. So your observation is correct is that the $70 million to $80 million in 2017 is starting well into the year, of course. And, as such, as we look in following years, the investment will be over a full year rather than just over what is going to be roughly a little bit more than half a year in 2017. So that\'s a good observation. The additional point is that we are starting with the U.S. and a handful of other markets, not yet with a global campaign. U.S. plus a handful of markets will be a very meaningful representation of our total revenues in these markets, of course, but not yet a global campaign, we may add other markets as we go forward. It\'s a little early for us to be more specific about what our expectation is for spend in 2018. We\'re obviously going to have more information under our belt in the next few months as we are actually rolling out advertising in these markets and in due time, we\'ll revisit that question of what the size would be for 2018. Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thank you. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. And with respect to the brand campaigns that we had in 2014 and 2015, it\'s not that they were failures. They just didn\'t quite achieve all of the objectives that we had wanted at the time. So we\'re actually taking a number of the learnings from those campaigns and applying them. One of the learnings was, hey, we don\'t want to just say that you can book on TripAdvisor. We want to drive home the price – the point that you\'re going to find the best price on TripAdvisor. And that\'s more of a value orientation in the message. And then, of course, the product needs to deliver that lowest-price front and center, and a couple of years ago, it didn\'t. The hero price on a particular page was not necessarily the cheapest and so we have added more supply into our store, and we\'ve changed our algorithm, so that we\'re showing you better deals and we\'re showing you better prices all the time. So the product is delivering more of what our current advertising will be talking about. So you take those components, plus the learnings, and that gives us confidence that this ad campaign just literally based upon what we did learn from last time, will work for us. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Good morning, Steve and Ernst. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize if it\'s already been asked, but how should we generally think about the privatization of meta versus instant book when you launch the new user interface in the coming months? Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes. This is Steve. You shouldn\'t think of those as necessarily connected. We\'ve been adjusting the placement of instant book over the past several quarters. It\'s floating more, or it\'s earning its right based upon what consumers want to do. And that aspect doesn\'t change as we roll out this new interface. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC And just a quick follow-up, in terms of the TV ad campaign. Is the intent to drive more awareness of the overall TripAdvisor brand or is it to drive awareness of meta versus instant book? Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Neither. We have tremendous aided brand awareness in most countries. We\'re looking to drive unaided awareness of TripAdvisor as a booking site. And so many people know us just as reviews and when they think they want to read reviews, they come to TripAdvisor. We want to make sure that when they\'re thinking about, "Hey, I want to get a good deal on this hotel that I want to stay at," that they come to TripAdvisor for that purpose. So, again, unaided booking awareness or unaided awareness as TripAdvisor is a booking site would be the key goal of that campaign. And the campaign is completely agnostic to instant book versus meta. It\'s about shopping, it\'s about booking the hotel. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. Thanks a lot. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Okay. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of James Lee with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed. Unknown Speaker Great. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Steve, can you maybe talk about some of the new targeting technology that you introduced for hotel search? For example, from a couple of industry conferences we attended, a few agency talked about your firm offering like CRM targeting and retargeting using pixels. And just curious how those technologies are performing versus your existing ones. And are you also testing maybe other technology like look-alike marketing as well on your platform? Thanks. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. So I\'m going to answer the question as kind of what are the targeting technologies that we offer our CPC and CPM clients to best target the traffic that they want that\'s on our site. And so, for CPM, we have many years of dividing up audiences, luxury audiences. There is a type of a look-alike product that our sales force has been using quite successfully. When it comes to the CPC, we do offer things like retargeting pixels on our clients\' sites so that they can bid differentially on traffic that\'s been on their site that is now on TripAdvisor, presuming that\'s a more attractive customer for them. They can bid up and that\'s capabilities that we\'ve offered for several quarters now. Unknown Speaker Are you seeing a very meaningful lift versus other targeting technology? Talking to some of your peers, especially on online marketing, when they start using CRM targeting, especially when it comes to search, they saw a pretty decent lift. I\'m just wondering from your process of working with clients, how you are seeing that impact? Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes, many of our clients have adopted many of the different things that we offer. You have to put it a little bit in perspective because we\'re familiar with retargeting capabilities as TripAdvisor advertises on other sites. And we tend to want to buy traffic to our site that has travel intent versus buying a car or a house or something. The folks that are looking to buy traffic on our site, all of our traffic is already prequalified as travel traffic. So it\'s already past the major hurdle. Now we\'re looking to new ones or our clients are looking to nuance it or our clients are looking to nuance it with their retargeting pixels or their Lookalike Audiences. So, yes, it\'s valuable, but not necessarily which is why we offer and why a lot of clients use it, and you can kind of infer some of that goodness in our CPC numbers from the number of bookings that we drive for our clients, but it\'s not the same order of magnitude that a Facebook or a Google might be able to offer to their audiences. Unknown Speaker Steve, can I also ask you a question regarding mobile monetization, some of your peers have been successfully using cross device attribution because they have a lot of log-in ID. So they can use mobile to assess credit for desktop attribution for conversion. Are you doing the same thing right now internally? Just curious where you are in that process? Have you done any test at all? And have you seen any success using cross-device attribution on your platform? Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. I\'d say, we like many other companies, where a majority of our revenue is not from logged-in users do have a really tough time tracking that mobile attribution, that it frankly drives us a bit crazy because we qualify millions of travelers every day on our phone, on our app and website, and then send them over to our clients, and then those users come back the next day and book on desktop on our client sites, and of course, we can\'t track it, our clients can\'t track it. So we don\'t get the credit that we deserve. That\'s part of that big monetization leak that we keep referring to and that one day instant book will help us address on the phone. But, no, I can\'t point to any tremendous data or successes in terms of cross-device attribution that we\'ve been able to share with our clients. So still a work in progress for us. Unknown Speaker Thanks, Steve. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Okay. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to go back to the marketing, again, apologies. You mentioned in the prepared remarks a handful of markets overseas. Can you just give us a little more color? Are you going to go in with a similar stance in terms of wait levels in weeks or is the international rollout more on a test basis? And any color you can give a sense of the coverage of your major international markets and whether the market list would be likely to expand appreciably next year or even later this year? Thank you. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Sure. So the handful of markets we\'ll sort of talk about the same message at a wait level that\'s appropriate for that market; i.e., not a small test but a meaningful spend so that we can see results and optimize. It would be perfectly reasonable to read into our comments that as we move on TV in 2018 since we\'re a global company, there\'s no logical argument that we would limit it to just the handful of markets that we\'re in TV now. You might instead read into, well, we couldn\'t tackle all markets in the very beginning. There\'s simply a bandwidth question that\'s involved. So we think we\'re making a very meaningful move here, limited by our ability to execute and the desire to learn as much as we can, as quickly as we can in order to optimize for next year. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you, Steve. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Yeah, thank you very much. Steve, in the past, I think you\'ve said that you think instant book is a better experience for mobile monetization. Do you still hold that view or do you think that it could be either instant book or meta? And then I had a follow-up question on the Non-Hotel side. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. So, when the instant book product has a parity price, then my personal opinion is it\'s a better product because it\'s fewer clicks to get what you want done. Where instant book has a worse price for whatever reason, we\'re not pushing it on you, because we\'re not asking you to spend more money for the privilege of using this path. And then rubber meets the road or the question is most relevant when you have a parity price with other providers, at which point, look, some users we fully expect to be loyal to a different booking site, they thank TripAdvisor for finding them the best price. That best price might be on Booking.com, and they click over to Booking.com, and they\'re happy with that experience, and we\'re fine with that. We got paid on the click and we helped drive the booking. Other folks, because they\'re in the habit of booking on TripAdvisor, using our instant book with our stored credit card, will prefer the TripAdvisor option because it\'s literally fewer clicks to actually finish that booking. No need to switch. So our wealth of product capabilities here allows us to tailor the experience to what we think that individual traveler is looking for. And we think that\'s a great option. So instant book on the phone when it has the better price, is clearly a better experience than meta because it saved money. When it\'s the worst price, you\'re probably not going to see it a whole lot. And when it\'s at price parity, the user gets to decide, if you will, and we make our suggestion in terms of order based upon what we think the user wants to see. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. That\'s great. And then quickly on the Non-Hotel side, especially, on attractions, I think as previously said, you think of this as a three to five year sort of a investment opportunity, where you actually want to focus on growing the business. And I think we are in year three in 2017, and you\'re already looking at margins kind of turning positive. Do you think that this business is ready to see some margin expansion from here on? How should we think about it? Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes, observation correct, Naved, is we have described it as a three to five-year journey, and we are in year three and we\'re seeing profits come through this year. We have invested significant amounts of dollars in 2015 and 2016 in growing our supply. But importantly, as Steve noted earlier, in making all this bookable supply also available on the TripAdvisor site where we have most leverage in terms of exposing it to the largest number of users. And we\'re now seeing that flywheel of supply, getting supply on, then making it available to all of these TripAdvisor users start to work, and so this is the first year where we, in aggregate, are profitable for this Non-Hotel segment which is a great trend, and we believe in the long-term, will make this segment not just a growing but a very profitable segment. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Ernst. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So now it\'s my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Steve Kaufer, Chief Executive Officer for closing comments and remarks. Sir? Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. The first quarter 2017 was a great starting point to the year. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but we are making progress on all of our initiatives as we build the best user experience in travel. I want to thank our employees around the globe for their continued hard work, and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thanks. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today\'s conference. This does concludes the program, you may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.

Our first question will come from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks guys. Nice job on the quarter. Steve, I guess, the first question is just can we get a little more color on what\'s driving the improvement in revenue per shopper in the U.S. market? Is it coverage? Is it better competition in the auction? Any color there would be helpful. And then, can you also talk about overall engagement? As you\'ve been making these changes to the mobile experience and as you see hotel shopper growth pick back up, what\'s happening with engagement, meaning is session frequency or visits per hotel shopper also going up? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Sure. So with regard to our revenue per shopper growth in the U.S., the biggest factor is certainly going to be the lapping of instant book. We have made a big bet in that category, built a really nice product. But it did have some dilutive effects. So now, we\'re at a really good spot where we have turned the team towards the regular optimization efforts that we normally go through and we\'re seeing results. Simultaneously as we indicated, we are working on our new shopping experience. And any time that we focus on delivering a better overall experience, we would look to one of the measurements being an increased revenue per shopper. When it comes to mobile, we\'ve certainly seen meaningful growth aligned with the industry as users tip over to be using mobile apps and web. And we\'ve seen, on our own side, an improved revenue per session from users using our mobile app. I don\'t have specific numbers I can share in terms of increased engagement to your specific question, but suffice to say, more and more users, more and more of the time, are using our apps for, not only hotel shopping, but the full trip. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc. Great. If I can ask one more follow-up for Ernst on the Non-Hotel segment, so you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you expect positive EBITDA for 2017. So can you talk about like where that margin might be exiting 2017 and remind us again what the longer-term margin profile for Non-Hotel looks like? Thank you. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yeah. We\'ve always described this as a multi-year process, in which we would initially invest in the Non-Hotel segment and then gradually turn it to profitability, as we saw more scale in the business. We\'ve been focused on building scale. This is the year where we\'re seeing some of that building scale come to fruition in terms of leverage on the bottom line. And, as we say, we expect this Non-Hotel segment in aggregate to be EBITDA positive, which we think is a great mid-point in our journey. As we go forward, we expect our margins in the longer run to be robust and attractive. We\'re not managing to a particular margin. We continue to see this business as a growth and investment business. But this year, we are going to see that profitability come through and a little faster than we even thought three months ago. The first quarter has seen very robust results on the top-line versus our expectations, but also on the bottom-line versus our expectation. We\'re seeing some efficiencies come through in this business. So, positive EBITDA for the year and a strong outlook for the future. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. To add just a tiny bit of additional color to that, we\'re pleased to note that in our attractions business, specifically the TripAdvisor as the demand channel, is growing faster than we had anticipated. And that was, of course, one of the big pieces of synergy that we were looking for when picking up the Viator business and all of that supply, how do we better monetize all of the demand that\'s already sitting on TripAdvisor? And so on the TripPlatform, the demand continues to grow quite quickly, and we\'re able to merchandise it better, having all the great Viator supply at our fingertips. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two also around the marketing theme. In decommissioning inefficient spend and redeploying that money into brand advertising, I\'m curious what you think that does for a return on your marketing dollars long term for the business. That will be number one. And number two, as you do sort of decommission inefficient spend and redeploy it into brand, anything we should be aware of in the quarter-to-quarter cadence of marketing that might buck some of the usual seasonality trends of marketing. Thanks so much for the color. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thank you, Eric. In terms of the long-term efficiency profile of our paid-marketing spend, we expect from TV to create much more lifetime value of users that we acquire and influence from TV than we are going to be able to get with online marketing. And so with our online marketing, we have managed to, pretty short-term, roughly breakeven as a channel, the ongoing benefit is more limited and difficult to prove. With TV, with a real shift of brand perception as TripAdvisor from a place just to use for planning, to use for planning plus price comparison and booking, we can get much more lasting impact on our user group. And therefore, over time, that should actually benefit our marketing efficiency profile. In terms of the seasonality of marketing spend cadence, not so much. I mean the marketing will still be aligned very much to the seasonality of the business, which doesn\'t change by doing advertising. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you. I had two questions somewhat related, it kind of has to do with the near-term risks. You\'re going to be reallocating a pretty significant amount of your online marketing spend, how confident are you that you kind of have your head around the negative impact that that\'s going to have to the top-line, at least in the near term? And then you will be changing your UI, it sounds like as well, how confident are you around modeling the short-term potential negative impacts? And I guess, the question there will be, also what do you see as some of the near-term potential negative impacts from the UI change? Thanks. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Okay. This is Ernst. I\'ll take the first question on the marketing, and Steve will take the product question. It is true that if we reallocate marketing dollars from online to TV is you get a positive impact in revenue on TV and potentially a negative impact on online. We have done quite a bit of work over the last three months in studying the different markets that we\'re going to go in with TV, studying our historical patterns of impact of TV that we have found. And although there is some volatility around the results there, we feel good about the projections that we are making and good about reiterating this double-digit growth this year on our transaction-based business for TripAdvisor. Steve you got... Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes. And with regard to the user interface, we are fortunate that this is the type of change that\'s mostly internal to TripAdvisor. It\'s not requiring a lot of assistance or behavior change on the part of our clients. So, we\'re in control over the testing methodology, the roll-out. You can see some of the changes already on the site, some of the changes already on the app, basically depending, if you get lucky enough to see it. But all of that goes into our testing and how we are able to gain confidence that is in fact revenue neutral or revenue positive, as we move to roll-out. I\'m not saying we wouldn\'t roll out completely if we were up or down by a little bit, but we do have a lot of capabilities and are experiencing this day-to-day in tuning and tweaking the design so that it delivers on not only a better experience, but the revenue expectations that we have in our plan. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thanks. In the script, you guys mentioned that absolute U.S. revenue per hotel shopper has fully recovered to levels to prior to instant book launch. It looked like by our math that the desktop rev per shopper still about 20% off the highs. Is the delta just international, and is that following a similar path to the U.S. in terms of improvement? And then just following up on some of the TV questions, it\'s always a challenge to change user behavior. And you guys have been working at it on the IP side. I guess what is it about the new campaign and/or the new page that makes you feel more confident you can really get users to come back closer to time of purchase? Is there anything just from the tests you\'ve seen in the new page design that gives you that incremental confidence? Thanks. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Lloyd, I\'ll take the first one, and Steve will take the second. The comment about RPS being back to 2014 levels, pertain to the U.S. and so we have seen that in the U.S. Internationally, we have not yet seen that. And so that was a clarification I want to make on that point. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. And in terms of TV changing behavior, there are many examples out there where a brand in a category comes up with, you could call it, line extension if you want. So, we all think back to Amazon that started at books and now did books and music, and books, music and of course, now they do everything, and they were able to do that because they have positioned themselves as a shopping site. Well, TripAdvisor is a travel site. You come to plan your trip. So, we have the credibility to be able to play in a number of different aspects in that travel planning, but we wouldn\'t be able to sell you a pair of shoes, that\'s kind of not what people associate TripAdvisor. So we come from a strength, reviews, as Amazon had come from a strength, books, but it\'s well within what users are using the site for to extend it to something else, and in our case, moving into that price comparison. So, we have a large portion of our current audience and have, for the past decade, come to TripAdvisor, read reviews and move into our price comparison engine and then click off to our partners or use instant book to book. So that\'s an already established behavior pattern for a large portion of our users. Our challenge isn\'t, hey, is that even possible? Will users do that sort of thing? They do. It\'s a huge business for us. The question is, can a TV campaign accelerate the move of the people who don\'t currently use us for that to join sort of the crowd that does. And a lot of people, when we ask will say, well, yes, I use it for reviews. I didn\'t know that you have price comparison. And, of course, I hear that and I think, how could you miss that on our site? Oh my goodness, it\'s plastered all over the place. But you have to accept what users are telling you. When we go on TV and we talk very clearly about price comparison, find the lowest price, help save you some money as a traveler. And we repeat that on the TV ad numerous times, we hope to educate that individual that the site that they already know and love can now be used for this new part of the hotel shopping experience, which they are already on TripAdvisor for. So we don\'t view it as a big leap or a big change. And when we looked at our last TV campaign, it was focused less around the benefit of comparing prices and more teaching about teaching users specifically that they can now book on TripAdvisor. So we\'ve tweaked that message. We\'ll be back out to the marketplace at a heavier weight with a more streamlined user experience that\'s focused around that hotel shopping. Think of it as less distractions on the page, more point how can we help you save some money in your shopping experience, how can we give you the best value for the hotel that you\'re looking for, not just the highest rated, but the best rated in your price point, those sorts of things. And we\'re giving ourselves time to make that message sink in through things like TV and our other online campaigns. So, I view our past TV as very instructive useful lessons to get us to where we are now, but we have a very compelling plan to achieve these objectives that we have in front of us now. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Makes sense. Thanks a lot, Steve. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Please proceed. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you very much. Steve, I know in the past you\'ve often referred to TripAdvisor as being indifferent between meta and instant booking. With the new hotel shopping experience rolling out, could you just characterize what if anything has changed within there? And then, secondly, one for Ernst. On click-based transaction revenue, you mentioned that international growth rates are still significantly lagging due to the constant currency. You obviously had a very strong quarter with the U.S. How should we think about the cadence of improvement in that international growth rate? And is there any reason that that should improve at a different rate than the U.S.? Thank you. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Great. Justin, I\'ll take the first part. So we look at meta and IB as two different methods to allow the user to find and book the hotel that they want. They are on our site. They\'re getting the best value that they can in the sort. They\'re looking at the photos, reading the reviews, building the confidence that they are getting the right spot, the right hotel. Now, the next thing the consumer absolutely needs is to get the best deal on that hotel. And so part of the new shopping experience helps pull people down that funnel of putting in your dates and actually getting to see our prices, and noting that we\'ve scoured the web and found you a great price. The thing that\'s not new in this quarter or in this redesign is where instant book fits into that mix, because we have been talking for several quarters about instant booking earning its position in our hotel shopping experience so that we put it in front of users when we think they are most likely to use it, either for price, because instant book might have the best price or convenience, particularly on the phone, if it\'s something you\'ve used before. So, we want to build that great shopping experience. Instant booking is a clear tool that help us do that and is a way that we can get better pricing in front of our consumers and make it more convenient, especially on the phone. But as we look forward in 2017-2018, if instant book, if as some people come to think, well, instant book is not as prominent as it once was, and that\'s because our customers are telling us they are indifferent as to whether they are choosing to use it versus something else, and that\'s okay with us, hence the comment on indifferent. We want to do what\'s best for our travelers, and we believe instant book plays a key role in that, though not as big a role as we had anticipated a couple of years ago. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. And then, Justin, your question about the click-based revenue and the international component of that. So, the U.S. is roughly half of our revenues and the other half is outside of the U.S. The UK is our largest market, but it\'s a long tail of many, many markets internationally. Part of the differential in growth rates is attributable to timing in IB and lapping of IB, but that\'s not the full story. Currency is one of the factors, if you compare, for instance, the pound, the UK being our largest non-U.S. market a year ago versus today. And then the mobile shift has tended to happen faster outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. And then there are many market-by-market differences. But generally, the overall market, the robustness of our auction, the level of competition is more favorable in the U.S. than in many places outside of the U.S. And so our anticipation is that the U.S. will remain the pace car in terms of growth in the foreseeable future that we believe that in the long-term, international markets can be robust growers for us. Two, that the pattern of growth recovery is likely to be a little slower than we\'ve seen in the U.S. and therefore, lag the U.S. more than just the lagging of the IB roll-out. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Got it. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hey. Good morning. I have two questions please. First, how much of the ability to maintain your EBITDA guidance for the year is a result of the reallocation of marketing funds versus the better profitability in the Non-Hotel segment? I\'d assume it\'s nearly all the reallocation of marketing dollars. But, first of all, is that correct? And then, second, I guess, following the previous question, assuming IB continues to be less of a focus, how do you envision navigating the challenge of the handoff problem for mobile that IB was meant to help or is that handoff, for instance, maybe just not a significant of an issue as you previously perceived it to be as you see the mobile mix grow? Thanks. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thank you, Mike. We\'re not breaking down in more detail where the EBITDA favorability comes from to offset the TV unfavorability. But we called out these two factors for a reason. They are both meaningful contributors to that. And so it\'s not only one or the other, we called these two out because they are both relevant. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. And with respect to instant book on the phone, if you look back, I keep talking about building the great shopping experience for hotel shoppers on the phone. And there is a click-off model that works quite well for us and others. But there\'s certainly a wonderful convenience of being able to essentially buy it with a single click, as sites like Amazon have shown. We don\'t see a reason why we won\'t be able to get there in the Hotel space. And to do that, you need something that kind of looks like instant book or something pretty close. So, if we fast-forward to the time when instant book really does have the best pricing available on the web, it\'s kind of matched the lowest price from anywhere, there is going to be in our prediction a set of travelers who love the TripAdvisor hotel shopping experience, have put in their credit cards and have now formed a habit, where they are a frequent repeat user of our app, because it\'s just simpler and you always get the lowest price. We\'re not forcing that on people, to be clear right now, but we see that as a wonderful endgame as the world moves to mobile. And if you\'re using us for price comparison, there isn\'t an obvious benefit of clicking out versus continuing your purchase on our site, unless someone else gives you the better price. And that\'s the challenge for the instant book team is always making sure that piece of the product has the best price. When we do that, we\'ll earn more than our fair share, more convenience. Where we don\'t, our business funnel says, will help the customer save the dollar by clicking them off to whoever does have the lowest price. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Can you provide any more color on the recently announced Grubhub deal? How broadly will it be rolled out on TripAdvisor? How will it be promoted? And how should we think about the revenue opportunity longer term? Thank you. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Sure. So as you know, we have a massive number of restaurants on the site globally. And folks, when they are looking for that place to eat, sometimes want to make a reservation, if it\'s a restaurant that takes reservations electronically, often want to read the reviews, look at the photos and sometimes want to do take-out, order the food delivery. Grubhub is a great partner. It covers many cities, certainly not all cities in the world, and presuming that works well for us, you\'d expect to see additional food delivery platforms coming online. I\'d caution against viewing that as a move-the-needle revenue opportunity for us as our traffic certainly tends to be a reasonable mix of tourists and locals, and tourists are going to be less likely to use a food delivery service, but based upon the scale of our restaurant space, it\'s kind of yet another product in the mix. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Please proceed. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC Hi. Thanks a lot. Could you give us any color on what you were seeing in April, especially with the Easter timing comp? And then on that, you also advised against extrapolating Q1 RPS growth into Q2. Can you give any more color on why you\'re more cautious on that? Thanks. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes. Thanks, Kevin. In our prepared remarks, we didn\'t call out any specific comments about April, but we did comment more broadly about extrapolation from Q1 into Q2 as you point out. And we caution against extrapolating some of the graphs that we put into our prepared remarks into Q2. Q1, as we said in the prepared remarks as well, was a quarter where the year-on-year comps for our paid marketing investment were relatively favorable. So we saw an ability to significantly grow our paid revenue line in Q1, which may not translate directly into Q2. And I\'ll make the point more generally, as some of these graphs that we put in, RPS and shoppers, if you look at the last few quarters, you could be tempted just to draw a straight line through some of those curves, and I just want to make sure of that. Although we have reiterated our expectation that we\'ll have double-digit growth in the click-based line this year and we feel very good about where we are and we feel good about our outlook there, the quarter-to-quarter progression may be not as smooth as some of the graphs have shown so far. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC Okay. Thanks, Ernst. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Please proceed. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks for taking my question. On capital allocation, you continue to churn out a decent amount of free cash flow and had a second consecutive quarter of decent buyback activity. Can you share how you\'re managing buybacks versus acquisitions versus investing for growth just given your comments around the long-term outlook for the business and where the stock is currently trading, would it make sense to be even more aggressive around the buybacks? Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thanks for the question, Jed. Indeed, we put $150 million to work in Q1 for share repurchases at an average price of $42.49. And I also want to underline what you said in your opening statement is that we are indeed generating significant cash flows just from operations. As we think about allocation, the areas of where we could invest outside of the business, outside the operations of the business is M&A, as evidenced in the last few years, in acquisitions that we\'ve made like Viator, like the TheFork, LaFourchette, last year we made a number of smaller investments but a number of investments there as well. And we\'ll continue to look at opportunities that may present itself in the M&A space. And then there\'s share repurchase as an opportunity as well. And as you say, we clearly, in 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017, have seen an opportunity to buy back some of our shares. The program is reviewed by the board from time to time. In January, the board approved refreshing the $250 million allocation that we had for share repurchases. And we have a 10b5 program in place with different triggers that we don\'t want to go into detail but they resulted in that purchase in Q1 and from time to time will allow us to benefit from periods where we believe our share price is attractive as an acquisition of ourselves, of our own stock. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. Can you guys help us understand how much of the recovery and a return to the pre-IB monetization levels that you\'re seeing in the U.S. is coming from optimizing on instant book versus shifting back to meta? And then also just wanted to follow up on mobile. Can you just talk about what the mobile to desktop monetization gap is here currently and your comments on extrapolating the same rationale, Ernst, that you mentioned a few minutes ago? Thanks. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes. So the U.S., I think it\'s a little bit difficult to untangle after so many years of how much of the RPS is this or the other. I do want to comment is we\'ve made continuous improvements on our revenue per shopper on desktop and in mobile. And in the U.S., we have been able to do that, and we\'ve been making continuous improvements on instant booking. We said a few quarters ago already that in the U.S. Instant booking was no longer dilutive to the overall offering, and we\'ve been improving both meta and IB since then. So I think it\'s a combination of factors, but it\'s just a sign that after fully incorporating instant booking in the U.S. now we\'re now better off than we were in 2014 and continue to show impressive growth to our revenue per shopper. In terms of the desktop monetization gap, we\'ve said in the past, if mobile monetizes roughly at one-third of desktop and those trends change a little quarter-over-quarter but not dramatically. We saw a quarter in the first quarter where there was revenue per shopper improvement on mobile. We had about 35% growth of our phone revenues and about 25% growth on the shopper line. And so we\'re very pleased with that, and we continue to sort of plug away making sure that we make that gap as small as we can. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thank you, Ernst. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. And then in terms of your last questions about the Q2, yeah, again, with mobile as with the general comments I was making quarter to quarter, there may be some volatility in revenue per shopper or in monetization of mobile, but the long-term trend is pretty stable. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Daniel Powell - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi. Thanks. This is Daniel Powell on for Heath. Just a couple quick ones from us. First, on the traffic growth and comments you\'ve made around paid acquisition, just curious if you could give any comments on what you\'re actually seeing in organic search and how much of that is coloring your decision to lean more into paid acquisition. And then on the Non-Hotel side, I just want to make sure we\'re interpreting your comments there correctly about it approaching 2016 growth levels, maybe suggesting an acceleration in the back half of the year against some tougher comps. Is that driven by seasonality mostly or is there something else that\'s changed in the business? Thanks. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thanks, Daniel, for the question. This is Steve. So I wouldn\'t say there is anything particularly different in our organic search trends. Google continues to take more space on search result pages on all devices for their own products and for other paid ads. There is nothing new in that statement. I\'ve been saying something like it for several years now. When we look at our overall marketing mix, we have more and more sort of brand traffic, we have paid traffic, we have organic traffic, we have our CRM program, and our focus at this point is on building what we call that branded direct traffic focused with a offline TV campaign in order to build more brand-direct, build more loyalty to Trip when a user is in mind for shopping. So I wouldn\'t say that shift is not a result of any specific organic search trend, but it is a change for us and we view a pretty meaningful one in terms of building the business for the long-term on a large component of brand-direct channels. Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. In terms of the Non-Hotel, it is indeed a very seasonal business and even the growth is somewhat seasonal. Last year in the first quarter, we posted from memory I believe 14% growth for Non-Hotel, which was substantially lower than the rest of the year. And indeed, we said in our prepared remarks that we expect for the full year Non-Hotel growth will be approaching the levels that we had for the full year of last year. So implied in that indeed is that we expect growth to be better in the rest of the year than the first quarter. Other than underlying some of the seasonality we\'ve seen in vacation rentals, for instance, a continued shift to a free-to-list model, which means we get paid on booking, which tends to happen in the summer rather than at the time of – at done stay, sorry, rather than at the time of booking. And then there\'s some currency issues in there again on Vacation Rentals but also our Attractions business are, for a large part, pound driven and, of course, we had Brexit in the adjustment to the pound happening in the second quarter of last year. So, all in all, a number of factors why we believe Q1 should be a lower point compared to the full year in terms of Non-Hotel growth. Daniel Powell - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Nat Schindler with Bank of America. Please proceed. Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yes, hi, Ernst, just wanted to go over in little more detail on the guidance and/or your profit outlook comments. You said you can maintain profit outlook comments, but at this point, your profit outlook comments are simply flat to down. So that, quite frankly, an infinite range. So if I look at ROI as negative on the brand campaign, I know you\'re switching out some inefficient marketing dollars to pay for that but there would be some revenue lift from that brand campaign as well. How much are you really thinking this hits on the negative line or are you saying that this has no impact from where you were thinking last quarter? Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes, Nat. Thanks for that question. We said last quarter, we said flat to down and you are right, that we didn\'t specify what down really could imply. What we really wanted to signal in this quarter is that that outlook has not changed because of TV and that effectively, the negative impact on EBITDA we expect from TV. You said it\'s ROI negative, we believe it\'s ROI negative in the near term. In the long term, we think it\'s very much ROI positive, but we\'ll have a near-term drag on EBITDA, just the TV campaign itself, which is offset by these two drivers that I talked about, partly by reallocating some of our online spend. So we\'ve looked at our total portfolio of advertising spend and said TV doesn\'t necessarily have to be just a bolt-on. We have looked at what does that mean for our online, and we have been allocating some expendables on the margin less efficient than the average and allocated that towards TV. And then as we highlighted, we have upgraded our outlook on profitability of our Non-Hotel segment. And those two factors together for 2017 happen to be roughly equivalent to the EBITDA loss that we expect from the TV campaign. So taken together do not have a meaningful impact on where we thought the business would be three months ago without this brand advertising campaign. And, therefore, we are reiterating the same guidance flat to down that we did a quarter ago. Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. And just one secondary question on this, because this is happening fairly late in the year, I\'m assuming that the $70 million to $80 million is smaller than you would do next year and the years after. And you mentioned a few years. This campaign will continue for at least a few years. Can you give us any color on what you think a normalized year on this campaign will be? And then just on another corollary to this brand campaign, you pulled back after the 2014 and 2015 campaigns. You pulled back on those campaigns because they didn\'t work as well as you hoped. What makes you think that this time TV will work better? Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes. So your observation is correct is that the $70 million to $80 million in 2017 is starting well into the year, of course. And, as such, as we look in following years, the investment will be over a full year rather than just over what is going to be roughly a little bit more than half a year in 2017. So that\'s a good observation. The additional point is that we are starting with the U.S. and a handful of other markets, not yet with a global campaign. U.S. plus a handful of markets will be a very meaningful representation of our total revenues in these markets, of course, but not yet a global campaign, we may add other markets as we go forward. It\'s a little early for us to be more specific about what our expectation is for spend in 2018. We\'re obviously going to have more information under our belt in the next few months as we are actually rolling out advertising in these markets and in due time, we\'ll revisit that question of what the size would be for 2018. Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thank you. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. And with respect to the brand campaigns that we had in 2014 and 2015, it\'s not that they were failures. They just didn\'t quite achieve all of the objectives that we had wanted at the time. So we\'re actually taking a number of the learnings from those campaigns and applying them. One of the learnings was, hey, we don\'t want to just say that you can book on TripAdvisor. We want to drive home the price – the point that you\'re going to find the best price on TripAdvisor. And that\'s more of a value orientation in the message. And then, of course, the product needs to deliver that lowest-price front and center, and a couple of years ago, it didn\'t. The hero price on a particular page was not necessarily the cheapest and so we have added more supply into our store, and we\'ve changed our algorithm, so that we\'re showing you better deals and we\'re showing you better prices all the time. So the product is delivering more of what our current advertising will be talking about. So you take those components, plus the learnings, and that gives us confidence that this ad campaign just literally based upon what we did learn from last time, will work for us. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Good morning, Steve and Ernst. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize if it\'s already been asked, but how should we generally think about the privatization of meta versus instant book when you launch the new user interface in the coming months? Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes. This is Steve. You shouldn\'t think of those as necessarily connected. We\'ve been adjusting the placement of instant book over the past several quarters. It\'s floating more, or it\'s earning its right based upon what consumers want to do. And that aspect doesn\'t change as we roll out this new interface. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC And just a quick follow-up, in terms of the TV ad campaign. Is the intent to drive more awareness of the overall TripAdvisor brand or is it to drive awareness of meta versus instant book? Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Neither. We have tremendous aided brand awareness in most countries. We\'re looking to drive unaided awareness of TripAdvisor as a booking site. And so many people know us just as reviews and when they think they want to read reviews, they come to TripAdvisor. We want to make sure that when they\'re thinking about, "Hey, I want to get a good deal on this hotel that I want to stay at," that they come to TripAdvisor for that purpose. So, again, unaided booking awareness or unaided awareness as TripAdvisor is a booking site would be the key goal of that campaign. And the campaign is completely agnostic to instant book versus meta. It\'s about shopping, it\'s about booking the hotel. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. Thanks a lot. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Okay. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of James Lee with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed. Unknown Speaker Great. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Steve, can you maybe talk about some of the new targeting technology that you introduced for hotel search? For example, from a couple of industry conferences we attended, a few agency talked about your firm offering like CRM targeting and retargeting using pixels. And just curious how those technologies are performing versus your existing ones. And are you also testing maybe other technology like look-alike marketing as well on your platform? Thanks. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. So I\'m going to answer the question as kind of what are the targeting technologies that we offer our CPC and CPM clients to best target the traffic that they want that\'s on our site. And so, for CPM, we have many years of dividing up audiences, luxury audiences. There is a type of a look-alike product that our sales force has been using quite successfully. When it comes to the CPC, we do offer things like retargeting pixels on our clients\' sites so that they can bid differentially on traffic that\'s been on their site that is now on TripAdvisor, presuming that\'s a more attractive customer for them. They can bid up and that\'s capabilities that we\'ve offered for several quarters now. Unknown Speaker Are you seeing a very meaningful lift versus other targeting technology? Talking to some of your peers, especially on online marketing, when they start using CRM targeting, especially when it comes to search, they saw a pretty decent lift. I\'m just wondering from your process of working with clients, how you are seeing that impact? Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes, many of our clients have adopted many of the different things that we offer. You have to put it a little bit in perspective because we\'re familiar with retargeting capabilities as TripAdvisor advertises on other sites. And we tend to want to buy traffic to our site that has travel intent versus buying a car or a house or something. The folks that are looking to buy traffic on our site, all of our traffic is already prequalified as travel traffic. So it\'s already past the major hurdle. Now we\'re looking to new ones or our clients are looking to nuance it or our clients are looking to nuance it with their retargeting pixels or their Lookalike Audiences. So, yes, it\'s valuable, but not necessarily which is why we offer and why a lot of clients use it, and you can kind of infer some of that goodness in our CPC numbers from the number of bookings that we drive for our clients, but it\'s not the same order of magnitude that a Facebook or a Google might be able to offer to their audiences. Unknown Speaker Steve, can I also ask you a question regarding mobile monetization, some of your peers have been successfully using cross device attribution because they have a lot of log-in ID. So they can use mobile to assess credit for desktop attribution for conversion. Are you doing the same thing right now internally? Just curious where you are in that process? Have you done any test at all? And have you seen any success using cross-device attribution on your platform? Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. I\'d say, we like many other companies, where a majority of our revenue is not from logged-in users do have a really tough time tracking that mobile attribution, that it frankly drives us a bit crazy because we qualify millions of travelers every day on our phone, on our app and website, and then send them over to our clients, and then those users come back the next day and book on desktop on our client sites, and of course, we can\'t track it, our clients can\'t track it. So we don\'t get the credit that we deserve. That\'s part of that big monetization leak that we keep referring to and that one day instant book will help us address on the phone. But, no, I can\'t point to any tremendous data or successes in terms of cross-device attribution that we\'ve been able to share with our clients. So still a work in progress for us. Unknown Speaker Thanks, Steve. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Okay. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to go back to the marketing, again, apologies. You mentioned in the prepared remarks a handful of markets overseas. Can you just give us a little more color? Are you going to go in with a similar stance in terms of wait levels in weeks or is the international rollout more on a test basis? And any color you can give a sense of the coverage of your major international markets and whether the market list would be likely to expand appreciably next year or even later this year? Thank you. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Sure. So the handful of markets we\'ll sort of talk about the same message at a wait level that\'s appropriate for that market; i.e., not a small test but a meaningful spend so that we can see results and optimize. It would be perfectly reasonable to read into our comments that as we move on TV in 2018 since we\'re a global company, there\'s no logical argument that we would limit it to just the handful of markets that we\'re in TV now. You might instead read into, well, we couldn\'t tackle all markets in the very beginning. There\'s simply a bandwidth question that\'s involved. So we think we\'re making a very meaningful move here, limited by our ability to execute and the desire to learn as much as we can, as quickly as we can in order to optimize for next year. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you, Steve. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Yeah, thank you very much. Steve, in the past, I think you\'ve said that you think instant book is a better experience for mobile monetization. Do you still hold that view or do you think that it could be either instant book or meta? And then I had a follow-up question on the Non-Hotel side. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. So, when the instant book product has a parity price, then my personal opinion is it\'s a better product because it\'s fewer clicks to get what you want done. Where instant book has a worse price for whatever reason, we\'re not pushing it on you, because we\'re not asking you to spend more money for the privilege of using this path. And then rubber meets the road or the question is most relevant when you have a parity price with other providers, at which point, look, some users we fully expect to be loyal to a different booking site, they thank TripAdvisor for finding them the best price. That best price might be on Booking.com, and they click over to Booking.com, and they\'re happy with that experience, and we\'re fine with that. We got paid on the click and we helped drive the booking. Other folks, because they\'re in the habit of booking on TripAdvisor, using our instant book with our stored credit card, will prefer the TripAdvisor option because it\'s literally fewer clicks to actually finish that booking. No need to switch. So our wealth of product capabilities here allows us to tailor the experience to what we think that individual traveler is looking for. And we think that\'s a great option. So instant book on the phone when it has the better price, is clearly a better experience than meta because it saved money. When it\'s the worst price, you\'re probably not going to see it a whole lot. And when it\'s at price parity, the user gets to decide, if you will, and we make our suggestion in terms of order based upon what we think the user wants to see. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. That\'s great. And then quickly on the Non-Hotel side, especially, on attractions, I think as previously said, you think of this as a three to five year sort of a investment opportunity, where you actually want to focus on growing the business. And I think we are in year three in 2017, and you\'re already looking at margins kind of turning positive. Do you think that this business is ready to see some margin expansion from here on? How should we think about it? Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc. Yes, observation correct, Naved, is we have described it as a three to five-year journey, and we are in year three and we\'re seeing profits come through this year. We have invested significant amounts of dollars in 2015 and 2016 in growing our supply. But importantly, as Steve noted earlier, in making all this bookable supply also available on the TripAdvisor site where we have most leverage in terms of exposing it to the largest number of users. And we\'re now seeing that flywheel of supply, getting supply on, then making it available to all of these TripAdvisor users start to work, and so this is the first year where we, in aggregate, are profitable for this Non-Hotel segment which is a great trend, and we believe in the long-term, will make this segment not just a growing but a very profitable segment. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Ernst. Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So now it\'s my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Steve Kaufer, Chief Executive Officer for closing comments and remarks. Sir? Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. The first quarter 2017 was a great starting point to the year. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but we are making progress on all of our initiatives as we build the best user experience in travel. I want to thank our employees around the globe for their continued hard work, and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thanks. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today\'s conference. This does concludes the program, you may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.
